description: The object of this work is not to describe all the many races of animals
  which have been domesticated by man, and of the plants which have been cultivated
  by him; even if I possessed the requisite knowledge, so gigantic an undertaking
  would be here superfluous. It is my intention to give under the head of each species
  only such facts as I have been able to collect or observe, showing the amount and
  nature of the changes which animals and plants have undergone whilst under man's
  dominion, or which bear on the general principles of variation. In one case alone,
  namely in that of the domestic pigeon, I will describe fully all the chief races,
  their history, the amount and nature of their differences, and the probable steps
  by which they have been formed. I have selected this case, because, as we shall
  hereafter see, the materials are better than in any other; and one case fully described
  will in fact illustrate all others. But I shall also describe domesticated rabbits,
  fowls, and ducks ...
