    <P align="JUSTIFY">It was shown in the fifteenth chapter that when
    individuals of the same variety, or even of a distinct variety, are
    allowed freely to intercross, uniformity of character is ultimately
    acquired. Some few characters, however, are incapable of fusion,
    but these are unimportant, as they are often of a semi-monstrous
    nature, and have suddenly appeared. Hence, to preserve our
    domesticated breeds true, or to improve them by methodical
    selection, it is obviously necessary that they should be kept
    separate. Nevertheless, a whole body of individuals may be slowly
    modified, through unconscious selection, as we shall see in a
    future chapter, without separating them into distinct lots.
    Domestic races have often been intentionally modified by one or two
    crosses, made with some allied race, and occasionally even by
    repeated crosses with very distinct races; but in almost all such
    cases, long-continued and careful selection has been absolutely
    necessary, owing to the excessive variability of the crossed
    offspring, due to the principle of reversion. In a few instances,
    however, mongrels have retained a uniform character from their
    first production.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When two varieties are allowed to cross freely,
    and one is much more numerous than the other, the former will
    ultimately absorb the latter. Should both varieties exist in nearly
    equal numbers, it is probable that a considerable period would
    elapse before the acquirement of a uniform character; and the
    character ultimately acquired would largely depend on prepotency of
    transmission and on the conditions of life; for the nature of these
    conditions would generally favour one variety more than another, so
    that a kind of natural selection would come into play. Unless the
    crossed offspring were slaughtered by man without the least
    discrimination, some degree of unmethodical selection would
    likewise come into action. From these several considerations we may
    infer, that when two or more closely allied species first came into
    the possession of the same tribe, their crossing will not have
    influenced, in so great a degree as has often been supposed, the
    character of the offspring in future times; although in some cases
    it probably has had a considerable effect.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Domestication, as a general rule, increases the
    prolificness of animals and plants. It eliminates the tendency to
    sterility which is common to species when first taken from a state
    of nature and crossed. On this latter head we have no direct
    evidence; but as our races of dogs, cattle, pigs etc., are almost
    certainly descended from aboriginally distinct stocks, and as these
    races are now fully fertile together, or at least incomparably more
    fertile than most species when crossed, we may with entire
    confidence accept this conclusion.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Abundant evidence has been given that crossing
    adds to the size, vigour, and fertility of the offspring. This
    holds good when there has been no previous close interbreeding. It
    applies to the individuals of the same variety but belonging to
    different families, to distinct varieties, sub-species, and even to
    species. In the latter case, though size is gained, fertility is
    lost; but the increased size, vigour, and hardiness of many hybrids
    cannot be accounted for solely on the principle of compensation
    from the inaction of the reproductive system. Certain plants whilst
    growing under their natural conditions, others when cultivated, and
    others of hybrid origin, are completely self-impotent, though
    perfectly healthy; and such plants can be stimulated to fertility
    only by being crossed with other individuals of the same or of a
    distinct species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, long-continued close
    interbreeding between the nearest relations diminishes the
    constitutional vigour, size, and fertility of the offspring; and
    occasionally leads to malformations, but not necessarily to general
    deterioration of form or structure. This failure of fertility shows
    that the evil results of interbreeding are independent of the
    augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents, though
    this augmentation no doubt is often highly injurious. Our belief
    that evil follows from close interbreeding rests to a certain
    extent on the experience of practical breeders, especially of those
    who have reared many animals of quickly propagating kinds; but it
    likewise rests on several carefully recorded experiments. With some
    animals close interbreeding may be carried on for a long period
    with impunity by the selection of the most vigorous and healthy
    individuals; but sooner or later evil follows. The evil, however,
    comes on so slowly and gradually that it easily escapes
    observation, but can be recognised by the almost instantaneous
    manner in which size, constitutional vigour, and fertility are
    regained when animals that have long been interbred are crossed
    with a distinct family.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These two great classes of facts, namely, the
    good derived from crossing, and the evil from close interbreeding,
    with the consideration of the innumerable adaptations throughout
    nature for compelling, or favouring, or at least permitting, the
    occasional union of distinct individuals, taken together, lead to
    the conclusion that it is a law of nature that organic beings shall
    not fertilise themselves for perpetuity. This law was first plainly
    hinted at in 1799, with respect to plants, by Andrew Knight<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and, not long afterwards, that sagacious
    observer K&#246;lreuter, after showing how well the Malvace&#230;
    are adapted for crossing, asks, "an id aliquid in recessu habeat,
    quod hujuscemodi flores nunquam proprio suo pulvere, sed semper eo
    aliarum su speciei impregnentur, merito quaritur? Certe natura nil
    facit frustra." Although we may demur to K&#246;lreuter's saying
    that nature does nothing in vain, seeing how many rudimentary and
    useless organs there are, yet undoubtedly the argument from the
    innumerable contrivances, which favour crossing, is of the greatest
    weight. The most important result of this law is that it leads to
    uniformity of character in the individuals of the same species. In
    the case of certain hermaphrodites, which probably intercross only
    at long intervals of time, and with unisexual animals inhabiting
    somewhat separated localities, which can only occasionally come
    into contact and pair, the greater vigour and fertility of the
    crossed offspring will ultimately tend to give uniformity of
    character. But when we go beyond the limits of the same species,
    free intercrossing is barred by the law of sterility.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In searching for facts which might throw light
    on the cause of the good effects from crossing, and of the evil
    effects from close interbreeding, we have seen that, on the one
    hand, it is a widely prevalent and ancient belief, that animals and
    plants profit from slight changes in their condition of life; and
    it would appear that the germ, in a somewhat analogous manner, is
    more effectually stimulated by the male element, when taken from a
    distinct individual, and therefore slightly modified in nature,
    than when taken from a male having the same identical constitution.
    On the other hand, numerous facts have been given, showing that
    when animals are first subjected to captivity, even in their native
    land, and although allowed much liberty, their reproductive
    functions are often greatly impaired or quite annulled. Some groups
    of animals are more affected than others, but with apparently
    capricious exceptions in every group. Some animals never or rarely
    couple under confinement; some couple freely, but never or rarely
    conceive. The secondary male characters, the maternal functions and
    instincts, are occasionally affected. With plants, when first
    subjected to cultivation, analogous facts have been observed. We
    probably owe our double flowers, rich seedless fruits, and in some
    cases greatly developed tubers, etc., to incipient sterility of the
    above nature combined with a copious supply of nutriment. Animals
    which have long been domesticated, and plants which have long been
    cultivated, can generally withstand, with unimpaired fertility,
    great changes in their conditions of life; though both are
    sometimes slightly affected. With animals the somewhat rare
    capacity of breeding freely under confinement, together with their
    utility, mainly determine the kinds which have been
    domesticated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We can in no case precisely say what is the
    cause of the diminished fertility of an animal when first captured,
    or of a plant when first cultivated; we can only infer that it is
    caused by a change of some kind in the natural conditions of life.
    The remarkable susceptibility of the reproductive system to such
    changes,&#8212;a susceptibility not common to any other
    organ,&#8212;apparently has an important bearing on Variability, as
    we shall see in a future chapter.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is impossible not to be struck with the
    double parallelism between the two classes of facts just alluded
    to. On the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of life, and
    crosses between slightly modified forms or varieties, are
    beneficial as far as prolificness and constitutional vigour are
    concerned. On the other hand, changes in the conditions greater in
    degree, or of a different nature, and crosses between forms which
    have been slowly and greatly modified by natural means,&#8212;in
    other words, between species,&#8212;are highly injurious, as far as
    the reproductive system is concerned, and in some few instances as
    far as constitutional vigour is concerned. Can this parallelism be
    accidental? Does it not rather indicate some real bond of
    connection? As a fire goes out unless it be stirred up, so the
    vital forces are always tending, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer,
    to a state of equilibrium, unless disturbed and renovated through
    the action of other forces.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In some few cases varieties tend to keep
    distinct, by breeding at different seasons, by great difference in
    size, or by sexual preference. But the crossing of varieties, far
    from diminishing, generally adds to the fertility of the first
    union and of the mongrel offspring. Whether all the more widely
    distinct domestic varieties are invariably quite fertile when
    crossed, we do not positively know; much time and trouble would be
    requisite for the necessary experiments, and many difficulties
    occur, such as the descent of the various races from aboriginally
    distinct species, and the doubts whether certain forms ought to be
    ranked as species or varieties. Nevertheless, the wide experience
    of practical breeders proves that the great majority of varieties,
    even if some should hereafter prove not to be indefinitely fertile
    <I>inter se,</I> are far more fertile when crossed, than the vast
    majority of closely allied natural species. A few remarkable cases
    have, however, been given on the authority of excellent observers,
    showing that with plants certain forms, which undoubtedly must be
    ranked as varieties, yield fewer seeds when crossed than is natural
    to the parent-species. Other varieties have had their reproductive
    powers so far modified that they are either more or less fertile
    than their parents, when crossed with a distinct species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, the fact remains indisputable that
    domesticated varieties, of animals and of plants, which differ
    greatly from one another in structure, but which are certainly
    descended from the same aboriginal species, such as the races of
    the fowl, pigeon, many vegetables, and a host of other productions,
    are extremely fertile when crossed; and this seems to make a broad
    and impassable barrier between domestic varieties and natural
    species. But, as I will now attempt to show, the distinction is not
    so great and overwhelmingly important as it at first appears.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>On the Difference in Fertility between Varieties and Species
      when crossed.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This work is not the proper place for fully
    treating the subject of hybridism, and I have already given in my
    'Origin of Species' a moderately full abstract. I will here merely
    enumerate the general conclusions which may be relied on, and which
    bear on our present point.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Firstly,</I> the laws governing the
    production of hybrids are identical, or nearly identical, in the
    animal and vegetable kingdoms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Secondly,</I> the sterility of distinct
    species when first united, and that of their hybrid offspring,
    graduate, by an almost infinite number of steps, from zero, when
    the ovule is never impregnated and a seed-capsule is never formed,
    up to complete fertility. We can only escape the conclusion that
    some species are fully fertile when crossed, by determining to
    designate as varieties all the forms which are quite fertile. This
    high degree of fertility is, however, rare. Nevertheless, plants,
    which have been exposed to unnatural conditions, sometimes become
    modified in so peculiar a manner, that they are much more fertile
    when crossed with a distinct species than when fertilised by their
    own pollen. Success in effecting a first union between two species,
    and the fertility of their hybrids, depend in an eminent degree on
    the conditions of life being favourable. The innate sterility of
    hybrids of the same parentage and raised from the same seed-capsule
    often differs much in degree.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Thirdly,</I> the degree of sterility of a
    first cross between two species does not always run strictly
    parallel with that of their hybrid offspring. Many cases are known
    of species which can be crossed with ease, but yield hybrids
    excessively sterile; and conversely some which can be crossed with
    great difficulty, but produce fairly fertile hybrids. This is an
    inexplicable fact, on the view that species have been specially
    endowed with mutual sterility in order to keep them distinct.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Fourthly,</I> the degree of sterility often
    differs greatly in two species when reciprocally crossed; for the
    first will readily fertilise the second; but the latter is
    incapable, after hundreds of trials, of fertilising the former.
    Hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses between the same two
    species likewise sometimes differ in their degree of sterility.
    These cases also are utterly inexplicable on the view of sterility
    being a special endowment.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Fifthly,</I> the degree of sterility of first
    crosses and of hybrids runs, to a certain extent, parallel with the
    general or systematic affinity of the forms which are united. For
    species belonging to distinct genera can rarely, and those
    belonging to distinct families can never, be crossed. The
    parallelism, however, is far from complete; for a multitude of
    closely allied species will not unite, or unite with extreme
    difficulty, whilst other species, widely different from one
    another, can be crossed with perfect facility. Nor does the
    difficulty depend on ordinary constitutional differences, for
    annual and perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants
    flowering at different seasons, inhabiting different stations, and
    naturally living under the most opposite climates, can often be
    crossed with ease. The difficulty or facility apparently depends
    exclusively on the sexual constitution of the species which are
    crossed; or on their sexual elective affinity, <I>i.e.
    Wahlverwandtschaft</I> of G&#228;rtner. As species rarely or never
    become modified in one character, without being at the same time
    modified in many characters, and as systematic affinity includes
    all visible similarities and dissimilarities, any difference in
    sexual constitution between two species would naturally stand in
    more or less close relation with their systematic position.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Sixthly,</I> the sterility of species when
    first crossed, and that of hybrids, may possibly depend to a
    certain extent on distinct causes. With pure species the
    reproductive organs are in a perfect condition, whilst with hybrids
    they are often plainly deteriorated. A hybrid embryo which partakes
    of the constitution of its father and mother is exposed to
    unnatural conditions, as long as it is nourished within the womb,
    or egg, or seed of the mother-form; and as we know that unnatural
    conditions often induce sterility, the reproductive organs of the
    hybrid might at this early age be permanently affected. But this
    cause has no bearing on the infertility of first unions. The
    diminished number of the offspring from first unions may often
    result, as is certainly sometimes the case, from the premature
    death of most of the hybrid embryos. But we shall immediately see
    that a law of an unknown nature apparently exists, which leads to
    the offspring from unions, which are infertile, being themselves
    more or less infertile; and this at present is all that can be
    said.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Seventhly,</I> hybrids and mongrels present,
    with the one great exception of fertility, the most striking
    accordance in all other respects; namely, in the laws of their
    resemblance to their two parents, in their tendency to reversion,
    in their variability, and in being absorbed through repeated
    crosses by either parent-form.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">After arriving at these conclusions, I was led
    to investigate a subject which throws considerable light on
    hybridism, namely, the fertility of heterostyled or dimorphic and
    trimorphic plants, when illegitimately united. I have had occasion
    several times to allude to these plants, and I may here give a
    brief abstract of my observations. Several plants belonging to
    distinct orders present two forms, which exist in about equal
    numbers, and which differ in no respect except in their
    reproductive organs; one form having a long pistil with short
    stamens, the other a short pistil with long stamens; both with
    differently sized pollen-grains. With trimorphic plants there are
    three forms likewise differing in the lengths of their pistils and
    stamens, in the size and colour of the pollen-grains, and in some
    other respects; and as in each of the three forms there are two
    sets of stamens, there are altogether six sets of stamens and three
    kinds of pistils. These organs are so proportioned in length to one
    another that, in any two of the forms, half the stamens in each
    stand on a level with the stigma of the third form. Now I have
    shown, and the result has been confirmed by other observers, that,
    in order to obtain full fertility with these plants, it is
    necessary that the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by
    pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in the other
    form. So that with dimorphic species two unions, which may be
    called legitimate, are fully fertile, and two, which may be called
    illegitimate, are more or less infertile. With trimorphic species
    six unions are legitimate, or fully fertile, and twelve are
    illegitimate, or more or less infertile.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The infertility which may be observed in various
    dimorphic and trimorphic plants, when illegitimately fertilised,
    that is, by pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height
    with the pistil, differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter
    sterility; just in the same manner as occurs in crossing distinct
    species. As the degree of sterility in the latter case depends in
    an eminent degree on the conditions of life being more or less
    favourable, so I have found it with illegitimate unions. It is well
    known that if pollen of a distinct species be placed on the stigma
    of a flower, and its own pollen be afterwards, even after a
    considerable interval of time, placed on the same stigma, its
    action is so strongly prepotent that it generally annihilates the
    effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen of the
    several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is
    strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed
    on the same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several
    flowers, first illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards
    legitimately, with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety,
    and all the seedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the
    legitimate pollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently,
    had wholly destroyed or prevented the action of the previously
    applied illegitimate pollen. Again, as, in making reciprocal
    crosses between the same two species, there is occasionally a great
    difference in the result, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic
    plants; for instance, the mid-styled form of <I>Lythrum
    salicaria</I> could be illegitimately fertilised with the greatest
    ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form,
    and yielded many seeds; but the short-styled form did not yield a
    single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled
    form.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In all these respects the forms of the same
    undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave in exactly
    the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed. This led
    me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised
    from several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that these
    illegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile.
    It is possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled
    and short-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants
    all three illegitimate forms. These can then be properly united in
    a legitimate manner. When this is done, there is no apparent reason
    why they should not yield as many seeds as did their parents when
    legitimately fertilised. But such is not the case; they are all
    infertile, but in various degrees; some being so utterly and
    incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a
    single seed or even seed-capsule. These illegitimate plants, which
    are so sterile, although united with each other in a legitimate
    manner, may be strictly compared with hybrids when crossed <I>inter
    se,</I> and it is well known how sterile these latter generally
    are. When, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed with either pure
    parent-species, the sterility is usually much lessened: and so it
    is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant.
    In the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run
    parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the
    two parent-species, so the sterility of certain illegitimate plants
    was unusually great, whilst the sterility of the union from which
    they were derived was by no means great. With hybrids raised from
    the same seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately variable,
    so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly, many
    hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers, whilst other and more
    sterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are weak, miserable
    dwarfs; exactly similar cases occur with the illegitimate offspring
    of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although there is the closest identity in
    character and behaviour between illegitimate plants and hybrids, it
    is hardly an exaggeration to maintain that the former are hybrids,
    but produced within the limits of the same species by the improper
    union of certain forms, whilst ordinary hybrids are produced from
    an improper union between so-called distinct species. We have
    already seen that there is the closest similarity in all respects
    between first illegitimate unions, and first crosses between
    distinct species. This will perhaps be made more fully apparent by
    an illustration:&#8212;we may suppose that a botanist found two
    well-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled form of
    the trimorphic <I>Lithrum salicaria,</I> and that he determined to
    try by crossing whether they were specifically distinct. He would
    find that they yielded only about one-fifth of the proper number of
    seed, and that they behaved in all the other above-specified
    respects as if they had been two distinct species. But to make the
    case sure, he would raise plants from his supposed hybridised seed,
    and he would find that the seedlings were miserably dwarfed and
    utterly sterile, and that they behaved in all other respects like
    ordinary hybrids, he might then maintain that he had actually
    proved, in accordance with the common view, that his two varieties
    were as good and as distinct species as any in the world; but he
    would be completely mistaken.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic
    plants are important, because they show us, first, that the
    physiological test of lessened fertility, both in first crosses and
    in hybrids, is no criterion of specific distinction; secondly,
    because we may conclude that there is some unknown bond which
    connects the infertility of illegitimate unions with that of their
    illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the same view to
    first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we find, and this seems
    to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the same
    species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in
    structure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions,
    and yet be sterile when united in certain ways. For we must
    remember that it is the union of the sexual elements of individuals
    of the same form, for instance, of two long-styled forms, which
    results in sterility; whilst it is the union of the sexual element
    proper to two distinct forms which is fertile. Hence the case
    appears at first sight exactly the reverse of what occurs in the
    ordinary unions of the individuals of the same species, and with
    crosses between distinct species. It is, however, doubtful whether
    this is really so; but I will not enlarge on this obscure
    subject.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We may, however, infer as probable from the
    consideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants, that the
    sterility of distinct species when crossed, and of their hybrid
    progeny, depends exclusively on the nature of their sexual
    elements, and not on any difference in their structure or general
    constitution. We are also led to this same conclusion by
    considering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species
    cannot be united, or only with great difficulty, with the female of
    a second species, whilst the converse cross can be effected with
    perfect facility. That excellent observer, G&#228;rtner, likewise
    concluded that species when crossed are sterile owing to
    differences confined to their reproductive systems.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the principle which makes it necessary for
    man, whilst he is selecting and improving his domestic varieties,
    to keep them separate, it would clearly be advantageous to
    varieties in a state of nature, that is to incipient species, if
    they could be kept from blending, either through sexual aversion,
    or by becoming mutually sterile. Hence it at one time appeared to
    me probable, as it has to others, that this sterility might have
    been acquired through natural selection. On this view we must
    suppose that a shade of lessened fertility first spontaneously
    appeared, like any other modification, in certain individuals of a
    species when crossed with other individuals of the same species;
    and that successive slight degrees of infertility, from being
    advantageous, were slowly accumulated. This appears all the more
    probable, if we admit that the structural differences between the
    forms of dimorphic and trimorphic plants, as the length and
    curvature of the pistil, etc., have been co-adapted through natural
    selection; for if this be admitted, we can hardly avoid extending
    the same conclusion to their mutual infertility. Sterility,
    moreover, has been acquired through natural selection for other and
    widely different purposes, as with neuter insects in reference to
    their social economy. In the case of plants, the flowers on the
    circumference of the truss in the guelder rose (<I>Viburnum
    opulus</I>) and those on the summit of the spike in the
    feather-hyacinth (<I>Muscari comosum</I>) have been rendered
    conspicuous, and apparently in consequence sterile, in order that
    insects might easily discover and visit the perfect flowers. But
    when we endeavour to apply the principle of natural selection to
    the acquirement by distinct species of mutual sterility, we meet
    with great difficulties. In the first place, it may be remarked
    that separate regions are often inhabited by groups of species or
    by single species, which when brought together and crossed are
    found to be more or less sterile; now it could clearly have been no
    advantage to such separated species to have been rendered mutually
    sterile, and consequently this could not have been effected through
    natural selection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species
    were rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with
    other species would follow as a necessary consequence. In the
    second place, it is as much opposed to the theory of natural
    selection, as to the theory of special creation, that in reciprocal
    crosses the male element of one form should have been rendered
    utterly impotent on a second form, whilst at the same time the male
    element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the
    first form; for this peculiar state of the reproductive system
    could not possibly have been advantageous to either species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In considering the probability of natural
    selection having come into action in rendering species mutually
    sterile, one of the greatest difficulties will be found to lie in
    the existence of many graduated steps from slightly lessened
    fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted, on the
    principle above explained, that it would profit an incipient
    species if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when
    crossed with its parent-form or with some other variety; for thus
    fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to
    commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation.
    But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which
    this first degree of sterility could be increased through natural
    selection to that higher degree which is common to so many species,
    and which is universal with species which have been differentiated
    to a generic or family rank, will find the subject extraordinarily
    complex. After mature reflection it seems to me that this could not
    have been effected through natural selection. Take the case of any
    two species which, when crossed, produce few and sterile offspring;
    now, what is there which could favour the survival of those
    individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher
    degree with mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one
    small step towards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind,
    if the theory of natural selection be brought to bear, must have
    incessantly occurred with many species, for a multitude are
    mutually quite barren. With sterile neuter insects we have reason
    to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have
    been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage
    having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they
    belonged over other communities of the same species; but an
    individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered
    slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not
    thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to
    the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their
    preservation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But it would be superfluous to discuss this
    question in detail; for with plants we have conclusive evidence
    that the sterility of crossed species must be due to some
    principle, quite independent of natural selection. Both
    G&#228;rtner and Kolreuter have proved that in general including
    numerous species, a series can be formed from species which when
    crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce
    a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of certain other
    species, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly impossible to
    select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to
    yield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone
    is affected, cannot have been gained through selection; and from
    the laws governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform
    throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the
    cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in all
    cases.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As species have not been rendered mutually
    infertile through the accumulative action of natural selection, and
    as we may safely conclude, from the previous as well as from other
    and more general considerations, that they have not been endowed
    through an act of creation with this quality, we must infer that it
    has arisen incidentally during their slow formation in connection
    with other and unknown changes in their organisation. By a quality
    arising incidentally, I refer to such cases as different species of
    animals and plants being differently affected by poisons to which
    they are not naturally exposed; and this difference in
    susceptibility is clearly incidental on other and unknown
    differences in their organisation. So again the capacity in
    different kinds of trees to be grafted on each other, or on a third
    species, differs much, and is of no advantage to these trees, but
    is incidental on structural or functional differences in their
    woody tissues. We need not feel surprise at sterility incidentally
    resulting from crosses between distinct species,&#8212;the modified
    descendants of a common progenitor,&#8212;when we bear in mind how
    easily the reproductive system is affected by various
    causes&#8212;often by extremely slight changes in the conditions of
    life, by too close interbreeding, and by other agencies. It is well
    to bear in mind such cases as that of the <I>Passiflora alata,</I>
    which recovered its self-fertility from being grafted on a distinct
    species&#8212;the cases of plants which normally or abnormally are
    self-impotent, but can readily be fertilised by the pollen of a
    distinct species&#8212;and lastly the cases of individual
    domesticated animals which evince towards each other sexual
    incompatibility.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We now at last come to the immediate point under
    discussion: how is it that, with some few exceptions in the case of
    plants, domesticated varieties, such as those of the dog, fowl,
    pigeon, several fruit-trees, and culinary vegetables, which differ
    from each other in external characters more than many species, are
    perfectly fertile when crossed, or even fertile in excess, whilst
    closely allied species are almost invariably in some degree
    sterile? We can, to a certain extent, give a satisfactory answer to
    this question. Passing over the fact that the amount of external
    difference between two species is no sure guide to their degree of
    mutual sterility, so that similar differences in the case of
    varieties would be no sure guide, we know that with species the
    cause lies exclusively in differences in their sexual constitution.
    Now the conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated
    plants have been subjected have had so little tendency towards
    modifying the reproductive system in a manner leading to mutual
    sterility, that we have very good grounds for admitting the
    directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such conditions
    generally eliminate this tendency; so that the domesticated
    descendants of species, which in their natural state would have
    been in some degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile
    together. With plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency
    towards mutual sterility, that in several well-authenticated cases,
    already often alluded to, certain species have been affected in a
    very different manner, for they have become self-impotent, whilst
    still retaining the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised
    by, distinct species. If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination
    of sterility through long-continued domestication be admitted, and
    it can hardly be rejected, it becomes in the highest degree
    improbable that similar circumstances should commonly both induce
    and eliminate the same tendency; though in certain cases, with
    species having a peculiar constitution, sterility might
    occasionally be thus induced. Thus, as I believe, we can understand
    why with domesticated animals varieties have not been produced
    which are mutually sterile; and why with plants only a few such
    cases have been observed, namely, by G&#228;rtner, with certain
    varieties of maize and verbascum, by other experimentalists with
    varieties of the gourd and melon, and by K&#246;lreuter with one
    kind of tobacco.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to varieties which have originated
    in a state of nature, it is almost hopeless to expect to prove by
    direct evidence that they have been rendered mutually sterile; for
    if even a trace of sterility could be detected, such varieties
    would at once be raised by almost every naturalist to the rank of
    distinct species. If, for instance, G&#228;rtner's statement were
    fully confirmed, that the blue and red flowered forms of the
    pimpernel (<I>Anagallis arvensis</I>) are sterile when crossed, I
    presume that all the botanists who now maintain on various grounds
    that these two forms are merely fleeting varieties, would at once
    admit that they were specifically distinct.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The real difficulty in our present subject is
    not, as it appears to me, why domestic varieties have not become
    mutually infertile when crossed, but why this has so generally
    occurred with natural varieties as soon as they have been modified
    in a sufficient and permanent degree to take rank as species. We
    are far from precisely knowing the cause; but we can see that the
    species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous
    competitors, must have been exposed to more uniform conditions of
    life during long periods of time than domestic varieties have been,
    and this may well make a wide difference in the result. For we know
    how commonly wild animals and plants, when taken from their natural
    conditions and subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and
    the reproductive functions of organic beings which have always
    lived and been slowly modified under natural conditions would
    probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of
    an unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the other hand,
    which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not
    originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life,
    and which can now generally resist with undiminished fertility
    repeated changes of conditions, might be expected to produce
    varieties, which would be little liable to have their reproductive
    powers injuriously affected by the act of crossing with other
    varieties which had originated in a like manner.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Certain naturalists have recently laid too great
    stress, as it appears to me, on the difference in fertility between
    varieties and species when crossed. Some allied species of trees
    cannot be grafted on one another, whilst all varieties can be so
    grafted. Some allied animals are affected in a very different
    manner by the same poison, but with varieties no such case until
    recently was known; whilst now it has been proved that immunity
    from certain poisons sometimes stands in correlation with the
    colour of the individuals of the same species. The period of
    gestation generally differs much in distinct species, but with
    varieties until lately no such difference had been observed. Here
    we have various physiological differences, and no doubt others
    could be added, between one species and another of the same genus,
    which do not occur, or occur with extreme rarity, in the case of
    varieties; and these differences are apparently wholly or in chief
    part incidental on other constitutional differences, just in the
    same manner as the sterility of crossed species is incidental on
    differences confined to the sexual system. Why, then, should these
    latter differences, however serviceable they may indirectly be in
    keeping the inhabitants of the same country distinct, be thought of
    such paramount importance, in comparison with other incidental and
    functional differences? No sufficient answer to this question can
    be given. Hence the fact that widely distinct domestic varieties
    are, with rare exceptions, perfectly fertile when crossed, and
    produce fertile offspring, whilst closely allied species are, with
    rare exceptions, more or less sterile, is not nearly so formidable
    an objection as it appears at first to the theory of the common
    descent of allied species.</P>
