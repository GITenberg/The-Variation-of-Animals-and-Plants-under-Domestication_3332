    <P align="JUSTIFY">The power of Selection, whether exercised by
    man, or brought into play under nature through the struggle for
    existence and the consequent survival of the fittest, absolutely
    depends on the variability of organic beings. Without variability
    nothing can be effected; slight individual differences, however,
    suffice for the work, and are probably the chief or sole means in
    the production of new species. Hence our discussion on the causes
    and laws of variability ought in strict order to have preceded the
    present subject, as well as inheritance, crossing, etc.; but
    practically the present arrangement has been found the most
    convenient. Man does not attempt to cause variability; though he
    unintentionally effects this by exposing organisms to new
    conditions of life, and by crossing breeds already formed. But
    variability being granted, he works wonders. Unless some degree of
    selection be exercised, the free commingling of the individuals of
    the same variety soon obliterates, as we have previously seen, the
    slight differences which arise, and gives uniformity of character
    to the whole body of individuals. In separated districts,
    long-continued exposure to different conditions of life may produce
    new races without the aid of selection; but to this subject of the
    direct action of the conditions of life I shall recur in a future
    chapter.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When animals or plants are born with some
    conspicuous and firmly inherited new character, selection is
    reduced to the preservation of such individuals, and to the
    subsequent prevention of crosses; so that nothing more need be said
    on the subject. But in the great majority of cases a new character,
    or some superiority in an old character, is at first faintly
    pronounced, and is not strongly inherited; and then the full
    difficulty of selection is experienced. Indomitable patience, the
    finest powers of discrimination, and sound judgment must be
    exercised during many years. A clearly predetermined object must be
    kept steadily in view. Few men are endowed with all these
    qualities, especially with that of discriminating very slight
    differences; judgment can be acquired only by long experience; but
    if any of these qualities be wanting, the labour of a life may be
    thrown away. I have been astonished when celebrated breeders, whose
    skill and judgment have been proved by their success at
    exhibitions, have shown me their animals, which appeared all alike,
    and have assigned their reasons for matching this and that
    individual. The importance of the great principle of Selection
    mainly lies in this power of selecting scarcely appreciable
    differences, which nevertheless are found to be transmissible, and
    which can be accumulated until the result is made manifest to the
    eyes of every beholder.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The principle of selection may be conveniently
    divided into three kinds. <I>Methodical selection</I> is that which
    guides a man who systematically endeavours to modify a breed
    according to some predetermined standard. <I>Unconscious
    selection</I> is that which follows from men naturally preserving
    the most valued and destroying the less valued individuals, without
    any thought of altering the breed; and undoubtedly this process
    slowly works great changes. Unconscious selection graduates into
    methodical, and only extreme cases can be distinctly separated; for
    he who preserves a useful or perfect animal will generally breed
    from it with the hope of getting offspring of the same character;
    but as long as he has not a predetermined purpose to improve the
    breed, he may be said to be selecting unconsciously.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Lastly, we have <I>Natural selection,</I>
    which implies that the individuals which are best fitted for the
    complex, and in the course of ages changing conditions to which
    they are exposed, generally survive and procreate their kind. With
    domestic productions, natural selection comes to a certain extent
    into action, independently of, and even in opposition to, the will
    of man.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Methodical Selection.</I>&#8212;What man has
    effected within recent times in England by methodical selection is
    clearly shown by our exhibitions of improved quadrupeds and fancy
    birds. With respect to cattle, sheep, and pigs, we owe their great
    improvement to a long series of well-known names&#8212;Bakewell,
    Coiling, Ellman, Bates, Jonas Webb, Lords Leicester and Western,
    Fisher Hobbs, and others. Agricultural writers are unanimous on the
    power of selection: any number of statements to this effect could
    be quoted; a few will suffice. Youatt, a sagacious and experienced
    observer, writes<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> the principle of
    selection is "that which enables the agriculturist, not only to
    modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether." A
    great breeder of Shorthorns<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> says,
    "In the anatomy of the shoulder modern breeders have made great
    improvement on the Ketton shorthorns by correcting the defect in
    the knuckle or shoulder-joint, and by laying the top of the
    shoulder more snugly in the crop, and thereby filling up the hollow
    behind it . . . The eye has its fashion at different periods: at
    one time the eye high and outstanding from the head, and at another
    time the sleepy eye sunk into the head; but these extremes have
    merged into the medium of a full, clear and prominent eye with a
    placid look."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Again, hear what an excellent judge of pigs<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> says: "The legs should be no longer
    than just to prevent the animal's belly from trailing on the
    ground. The leg is the least profitable portion of the hog, and we
    therefore require no more of it than is absolutely necessary for
    the support of the rest." Let any one compare the wild-boar with
    any improved breed, and he will see how effectually the legs have
    been shortened.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Few persons, except breeders, are aware of the
    systematic care taken in selecting animals, and of the necessity of
    having a clear and almost prophetic vision into futurity. Lord
    Spencer's skill and judgment were well known; and he writes,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> "It is therefore very desirable,
    before any man commences to breed either cattle or sheep, that he
    should make up his mind to the shape and qualities he wishes to
    obtain, and steadily pursue this object." Lord Somerville, in
    speaking of the marvellous improvement of the New Leicester sheep,
    effected by Bakewell and his successors, says, "It would seem as if
    they had first drawn a perfect form, and then given it life."
    Youatt<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> urges the necessity of
    annually drafting each flock, as many animals will certainly
    degenerate "from the standard of excellence which the breeder has
    established in his own mind." Even with a bird of such little
    importance as the canary, long ago (1780-1790) rules were
    established, and a standard of perfection was fixed according to
    which the London fanciers tried to breed the several
    sub-varieties.<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> A great winner of
    prizes at the Pigeon-shows,<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> in
    describing the short-faced Almond Tumbler, says, "There are many
    first-rate fanciers who are particularly partial to what is called
    the goldfinch-beak, which is very beautiful; others say, take a
    full-size round cherry then take a barleycorn, and judiciously
    placing and thrusting it into the cherry, form as it were your
    beak; and that is not all, for it will form a good head and beak,
    provided, as I said before, it is judiciously done; others take an
    oat; but as I think the goldfinch-beak the handsomest, I would
    advise the inexperienced fancier to get the head of a goldfinch,
    and keep it by him for his observation." Wonderfully different as
    are the beaks of the rock pigeon and goldfinch, the end has
    undoubtedly been nearly gained, as far as external shape and
    proportions are concerned.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Not only should our animals be examined with the
    greatest care whilst alive, but, as Anderson remarks<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> their carcases should be scrutinised, "so
    as to breed from the descendants of such only as, in the language
    of the butcher, cut up well." The "grain of the meat" in cattle,
    and its being well marbled with fat,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> and the greater or less accumulation of
    fat in the abdomen of our sheep, have been attended to with
    success. So with poultry, a writer,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> speaking of Cochin-China fowls, which
    are said to differ much in the quality of their flesh, says, "the
    best mode is to purchase two young brother-cocks, kill, dress, and
    serve up one; if he be indifferent, similarly dispose of the other,
    and try again; if, however, he be fine and well-flavoured, his
    brother will not be amiss for breeding purposes for the table."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The great principle of the division of labour
    has been brought to bear on selection. In certain districts<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> "the breeding of bulls is confined to a
    very limited number of persons, who by devoting their whole
    attention to this department, are able from year to year to furnish
    a class of bulls which are steadily improving the general breed of
    the district." The rearing and letting of choice rams has long
    been, as is well known, a chief source of profit to several eminent
    breeders. In parts of Germany this principle is carried with merino
    sheep to an extreme point.<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> So
    "important is the proper selection of breeding animals considered,
    that the best flock-masters do not trust to their own judgment or
    to that of their shepherds, but employ persons called
    'sheep-classifiers' who make it their special business to attend to
    this part of the management of several flocks, and thus to
    preserve, or if possible to improve, the best qualities of both
    parents in the lambs." In Saxony, "when the lambs are weaned, each
    in his turn is placed upon a table that his wool and form may be
    minutely observed. The finest are selected for breeding and receive
    a first mark. When they are one year old, and prior to shearing
    them, another close examination of those previously marked takes
    place: those in which no defect can be found receive a second mark,
    and the rest are condemned. A few months afterwards a third and
    last scrutiny is made; the prime rams and ewes receive a third and
    final mark, but the slightest blemish is sufficient to cause the
    rejection of the animal." These sheep are bred and valued almost
    exclusively for the fineness of their wool; and the result
    corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection.
    Instruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness
    of the fibres; and "an Austrian fleece has been produced of which
    twelve hairs equalled in thickness one from a Leicester sheep."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Throughout the world, wherever silk is produced,
    the greatest care is bestowed on selecting the cocoons from which
    the moths for breeding are to be reared. A careful cultivator<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> likewise examines the moths
    themselves, and destroys those that are not perfect. But what more
    immediately concerns us is that certain families in France devote
    themselves to raising eggs for sale.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> In China, near Shanghai, the inhabitants
    of two small districts have the privilege of raising eggs for the
    whole surrounding country, and that they may give up their whole
    time to this business, they are interdicted by law from producing
    silk.<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The care which successful breeders take in
    matching their birds is surprising. Sir John Sebright, whose fame
    is perpetuated by the "Sebright Bantam," used to spend "two and
    three days in examining, consulting, and disputing with a friend
    which were the best of five or six birds."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> Mr. Bult, whose pouter-pigeons won so
    many prizes, and were exported to North America under the charge of
    a man sent on purpose, told me that he always deliberated for
    several days before he matched each pair. Hence we can understand
    the advice of an eminent fancier, who writes<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> "I would here particularly guard you
    against having too great a variety of pigeons, otherwise you will
    know a little of all, but nothing about one as it ought to be
    known." Apparently it transcends the power of the human intellect
    to breed all kinds: "it is possible that there may be a few
    fanciers that have a good general knowledge of fancy pigeons; but
    there are many more who labour under the delusion of supposing they
    know what they do not." The excellence of one sub-variety, the
    Almond Tumbler, lies in the plumage, carriage, head, beak, and eye;
    but it is too presumptuous in the beginner to try for all these
    points. The great judge above quoted says, "There are some young
    fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the above five
    properties at once; they have their reward by getting nothing." We
    thus see that breeding even fancy pigeons is no simple art: we may
    smile at the solemnity of these precepts, but he who laughs will
    win no prizes.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">What methodical selection has effected for our
    animals is sufficiently proved, as already remarked, by our
    Exhibitions. So greatly were the sheep belonging to some of the
    earlier breeders, such as Bakewell and Lord Western, changed, that
    many persons could not be persuaded that they had not been crossed.
    Our pigs, as Mr. Corringham remarks<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> during the last twenty years have
    undergone, through rigorous selection together with crossing, a
    complete metamorphosis. The first exhibition for poultry was held
    in the Zoological Gardens in 1845; and the improvement effected
    since that time has been great. As Mr. Bailey, the great judge,
    remarked to me, it was formerly ordered that the comb of the
    Spanish cock should be upright, and in four or five years all good
    birds had upright combs; it was ordered that the Polish cock should
    have no comb or wattles, and now a bird thus furnished would be at
    once disqualified; beards were ordered, and out of fifty-seven pens
    lately (1860) exhibited at the Crystal Palace, all had beards. So
    it has been in many other cases. But in all cases the judges order
    only what is occasionally produced and what can be improved and
    rendered constant by selection. The steady increase in weight
    during the last few years in our fowls, turkeys, ducks, and geese
    is notorious; "six-pound ducks are now common, whereas four pounds
    was formerly the average." As the time required to make a change
    has not often been recorded, it may be worth mentioning that it
    took Mr. Wicking thirteen years to put a clean white head on an
    almond tumbler's body, "a triumph," says another fancier, "of which
    he may be justly proud."<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Tollet, of Betley Hall, selected cows, and
    especially bulls, descended from good milkers, for the sole purpose
    of improving his cattle for the production of cheese; he steadily
    tested the milk with the lactometer, and in eight years he
    increased, as I was informed by him, the product in proportion of
    four to three. Here is a curious case<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> of steady but slow progress, with the
    end not as yet fully attained: in 1784 a race of silkworms was
    introduced into France, in which one hundred in the thousand failed
    to produce white cocoons; but now after careful selection during
    sixty-five generations, the proportion of yellow cocoons has been
    reduced to thirty-five in the thousand.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With plants selection has been followed with the
    same good result as with animals. But the process is simpler, for
    plants in the great majority of cases bear both sexes.
    Nevertheless, with most kinds it is necessary to take as much care
    to prevent crosses as with animals or unisexual plants; but with
    some plants, such as peas, this care is not necessary. With all
    improved plants, excepting of course those which are propagated by
    buds, cuttings, etc., it is almost indispensable to examine the
    seedlings and destroy those which depart from the proper type. This
    is called "roguing," and is, in fact, a form of selection, like the
    rejection of inferior animals. Experienced horticulturists and
    agriculturists incessantly urge every one to preserve the finest
    plants for the production of seed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although plants often present much more
    conspicuous variations than animals, yet the closest attention is
    generally requisite to detect each slight and favourable change.
    Mr. Masters relates<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> how "many a
    patient hour was devoted," whilst he was young, to the detection of
    differences in peas intended for seed. Mr. Barnet<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> remarks that the old scarlet American
    strawberry was cultivated for more than a century without producing
    a single variety; and another writer observes how singular it was
    that when gardeners first began to attend to this fruit it began to
    vary; the truth no doubt being that it had always varied, but that,
    until slight variations were selected and propagated by seed, no
    conspicuous result was obtained. The finest shades of difference in
    wheat have been discriminated and selected with almost as much care
    as, in the case of the higher animals, for instance by Col. Le
    Couteur and more especially by Major Hallett.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It may be worth while to give a few examples of
    methodical selection with plants; but in fact the great improvement
    of all our anciently cultivated plants may be attributed to
    selection long carried on, in part methodically, and in part
    unconsciously. I have shown in a former chapter how the weight of
    the gooseberry has been increased by systematic selection and
    culture. The flowers of the Heartsease have been similarly
    increased in size and regularity of outline. With the Cineraria,
    Mr. Glenny<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> "was bold enough when
    the flowers were ragged and starry and ill defined in colour, to
    fix a standard which was then considered outrageously high and
    impossible, and which, even if reached, it was said, we should be
    no gainers by, as it would spoil the beauty of the flowers. He
    maintained that he was right; and the event has proved it to be
    so." The doubling of flowers has several times been effected by
    careful selection: the Rev. W. Williamson,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> after sowing during several years seed
    of <I>Anemone coronaria,</I> found a plant with one additional
    petal; he sowed the seed of this, and by perseverance in the same
    course obtained several varieties with six or seven rows of petals.
    The single Scotch rose was doubled, and yielded eight good
    varieties in nine or ten years.<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
    The Canterbury bell (<I>Campanula medium</I>) was doubled by
    careful selection in four generations.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> In four years Mr. Buckman,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> by culture and careful selection,
    converted parsnips, raised from wild seed, into a new and good
    variety. By selection during a long course of years, the early
    maturity of peas has been hastened by between ten and twenty-one
    days.<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> A more curious case is
    offered by the beet plant, which since its cultivation in France,
    has almost exactly doubled its yield of sugar. This has been
    effected by the most careful selection; the specific gravity of the
    roots being regularly tested, and the best roots saved for the
    production of seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A></P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Selection by Ancient and Semi-civilised People.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In attributing so much importance to the
    selection of animals and plants, it may be objected, that
    methodical selection would not have been carried on during ancient
    times. A distinguished naturalist considers it as absurd to suppose
    that semi-civilised people should have practised selection of any
    kind. Undoubtedly the principle has been systematically
    acknowledged and followed to a far greater extent within the last
    hundred years than at any former period, and a corresponding result
    has been gained; but it would be a greater error to suppose, as we
    shall immediately see, that its importance was not recognised and
    acted on during the most ancient times, and by semi-civilised
    people. I should premise that many facts now to be given only show
    that care was taken in breeding; but when this is the case,
    selection is almost sure to be practised to a certain extent. We
    shall hereafter be enabled better to judge how far selection, when
    only occasionally carried on, by a few of the inhabitants of a
    country, will slowly produce a great effect.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In a well-known passage in the thirtieth chapter
    of Genesis, rules are given for influencing, as was then thought
    possible, the colour of sheep; and speckled and dark breeds are
    spoken of as being kept separate. By the time of David the fleece
    was likened to snow. Youatt,<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> who
    has discussed all the passages in relation to breeding in the Old
    Testament, concludes that at this early period "some of the best
    principles of breeding must have been steadily and long pursued."
    It was ordered, according to Moses, that "Thou shalt not let thy
    cattle gender with a diverse kind;" but mules were purchased<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> so that at this early period other
    nations must have crossed the horse and ass. It is said<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> that Erichthonius, some generations
    before the Trojan war, had many brood-mares, "which by his care and
    judgment in the choice of stallions produced a breed of horses
    superior to any in the surrounding countries." Homer (Book 5)
    speaks of Aeneas' horses as bred from mares which were put to the
    steeds of Laomedon. Plato, in his 'Republic' says to Glaucus, "I
    see that you raise at your house a great many dogs for the chase.
    Do you take care about breeding and pairing them? Among animals of
    good blood, are there not always some which are superior to the
    rest?" To which Glaucus answers in the affirmative.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> Alexander the Great selected the finest
    Indian cattle to send to Macedonia to improve the breed.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> According to Pliny,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> King Pyrrhus had an especially valuable
    breed of oxen: and he did not suffer the bulls and cows to come
    together till four years old, that the breed might not degenerate.
    Virgil, in his Georgics (lib. 3), gives as strong advice as any
    modern agriculturist could do, carefully to select the breeding
    stock; "to note the tribe, the lineage, and the sire; whom to
    reserve for husband of the herd;"&#8212;to brand the
    progeny;&#8212;to select sheep of the purest white, and to examine
    if their tongues are swarthy. We have seen that the Romans kept
    pedigrees of their pigeons, and this would have been a senseless
    proceeding had not great care been taken in breeding them.
    Columella gives detailed instructions about breeding fowls: "Let
    the breeding hens therefore be of a choice colour, a robust body,
    square-built, full-breasted, with large heads, with upright and
    bright-red combs. Those are believed to be the best bred which have
    five toes."<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> According to Tacitus,
    the Celts attended to the races of their domestic animals; and
    Caesar states that they paid high prices to merchants for fine
    imported horses.<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> In regard to
    plants, Virgil speaks of yearly culling the largest seeds; and
    Celsus says, "where the corn and crop is but small, we must pick

    said to have "wonderfully improved" his pigeons by crossing the

    same period the Dutch attended with the greatest care to the
    breeding of these birds. Belon in 1555 says that good managers in
    France examined the colour of their goslings in order to get geese
    of a white colour and better kinds. Markham in 1631 tells the
    breeder "to elect the largest and goodliest conies," and enters
    into minute details. Even with respect to seeds of plants for the

    plants for seed; so that even such details were attended to in our

    selection has been silently carried on in places where it would not
    have been expected, I may add that in the middle of the last

    careful selection all his vegetables, "so that they were greatly

    breeding or selecting them; and this to a large extent is true.
    Roulin,<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> however, describes in

    of the existence in Banda Oriental of a breed with reversed hair;
    and the extraordinary niata cattle first appeared and have since
    been kept distinct in La Plata. Hence certain conspicuous
    variations have been preserved, and others have been habitually
    destroyed, in these countries, which are so little favourable for
    careful selection. We have also seen that the inhabitants sometimes
    introduce fresh cattle on their estates to prevent the evil effects
    of close interbreeding. On the other hand, I have heard on reliable
    authority that the Gauchos of the Pampas never take any pains in
    selecting the best bulls or stallions for breeding; and this
    probably accounts for the cattle and horses being remarkably

    vigour, in the same way as the keepers in large warrens now
    sometimes cross their ferrets (as I have been informed by Mr.
    Yarrell) with the wild polecat, "to give them more devil."
    According to Varro, the wild ass was formerly caught and crossed
    with the tame animal to improve the breed, in the same manner as at

    as the dogs of one locality are famed throughout the country for

    the same as that given for a wife: they are kept in a sort of cage,
    and the Indians "take great care when the female is in season to
    prevent her uniting with a dog of an inferior description." The
    Indians told Sir Robert that, if a dog proved bad or useless, he
    was not killed, but was left to die from sheer neglect. Hardly any
    nation is more barbarous than the Fuegians, but I hear from Mr.
    Bridges, the Catechist to the Mission, that, "when these savages
    have a large, strong, and active bitch, they take care to put her

    states that he has known a Damara give two fine oxen for a dog
    which struck his fancy. The Damaras take great delight in having
    whole droves of cattle of the same colour, and they prize their
    oxen in proportion to the size of their horns. "The Namaquas have a
    perfect mania for a uniform team; and almost all the people of
    Southern Africa value their cattle next to their women, and take a
    pride in possessing animals that look high-bred. They rarely or

    cow.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The most curious case of selection by
    semi-civilised people, or indeed by any people, which I have found
    recorded, is that given by Garcilazo de la Vega, a descendant of
    the Incas, as having been practised in Peru before the country was
    subjugated by the Spaniards.<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> The
    Incas annually held great hunts, when all the wild animals were
    driven from an immense circuit to a central point. The beasts of
    prey were first destroyed as injurious. The wild Guanacos and
    Vicunas were sheared; the old males and females killed, and the
    others set at liberty. The various kinds of deer were examined; the
    old males and females were likewise killed, "but the young females,
    with a certain number of males, selected from the most beautiful
    and strong," were given their freedom. Here, then, we have
    selection by man aiding natural selection. So that the Incas
    followed exactly the reverse system of that which our Scottish
    sportsman are accused of following, namely, of steadily killing the
    finest stags, thus causing the whole race to degenerate.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> In regard to the domesticated llamas and
    alpacas, they were separated in the time of the Incas according to
    colour: and if by chance one in a flock was born of the wrong
    colour, it was eventually put into another flock.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the genus Auchenia there are four
    forms,&#8212;the Guanaco and Vicuna, found wild and undoubtedly
    distinct species; the Llama and Alpaca, known only in a
    domesticated condition. These four animals appear so different,
    that most naturalists, especially those who have studied these
    animals in their native country, maintain that they are
    specifically distinct, notwithstanding that no one pretends to have
    seen a wild llama or alpaca. Mr. Ledger, however, who has closely
    studied these animals both in Peru and during their exportation to
    Australia, and who has made many experiments on their propagation,
    adduces arguments<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> which seem to
    me conclusive, that the llama is the domesticated descendant of the
    guanaco, and the alpaca of the vicuna. And now that we know that
    these animals were systematically bred and selected many centuries
    ago, there is nothing surprising in the great amount of change
    which they have undergone.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It appeared to me at one time probable that,
    though ancient and semi-civilised people might have attended to the
    improvement of their more useful animals in essential points, yet
    that they would have disregarded unimportant characters. But human
    nature is the same throughout the world: fashion everywhere reigns
    supreme, and man is apt to value whatever he may chance to possess.
    We have seen that in South America the niata cattle, which
    certainly are not made useful by their shortened faces and upturned
    nostrils, have been preserved. The Damaras of South Africa value
    their cattle for uniformity of colour and enormously long horns.
    And I will now show that there is hardly any peculiarity in our
    most useful animals which, from fashion, superstition, or some
    other motive, has not been valued, and consequently preserved. With
    respect to cattle, "an early record," according to Youatt<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> "speaks of a hundred white cows with red
    ears being demanded as a compensation by the princes of North and
    South Wales. If the cattle were of a dark or black colour, 150 were
    to be presented." So that colour was attended to in Wales before
    its subjugation by England. In Central Africa, an ox that beats the
    ground with its tail is killed; and in South Africa some of the
    Damaras will not eat the flesh of a spotted ox. The Kaffirs value
    an animal with a musical voice; and "at a sale in British Kaffraria
    the low "of a heifer excited so much admiration that a sharp
    competition sprung up for her possession, and she realised a
    considerable price."<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> With respect
    to sheep, the Chinese prefer rams without horns; the Tartars prefer
    them with spirally wound horns, because the hornless are thought to
    lose courage.<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> Some of the Damaras
    will not eat the flesh of hornless sheep. In regard to horses, at
    the end of the fifteenth century animals of the colour described as
    liart pomme were most valued in France. The Arabs have a proverb,
    "Never buy a horse with four white feet, for he carries his shroud
    with him";<A href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> the Arabs also, as we
    have seen, despise dun-coloured horses. So with dogs, Xenophon and
    others at an ancient period were prejudiced in favour of certain
    colours; and "white or slate-coloured hunting dogs were not
    esteemed."<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Turning to poultry, the old Roman gourmands
    thought that the liver of a white goose was the most savoury. In
    Paraguay black-skinned fowls are kept because they are thought to
    be more productive, and their flesh the most proper for invalids.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> In Guiana, as I am informed by Sir
    R. Schomburgk, the aborigines will not eat the flesh or eggs of the
    fowl, but two races are kept distinct merely for ornament. In the
    Philippines, no less than nine sub-varieties of the game-cock are
    kept and named, so that they must be separately bred.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">At the present time in Europe, the smallest
    peculiarities are carefully attended to in our most useful animals,
    either from fashion, or as a mark of purity of blood. Many examples
    could be given; two will suffice. "In the Western counties of
    England the prejudice against a white pig is nearly as strong as
    against a black one in Yorkshire." In one of the Berkshire
    sub-breeds, it is said, "the white should be confined to four white
    feet, a white spot between the eyes, and a few white hairs behind
    each shoulder." Mr. Saddler possessed three hundred pigs, every one
    of which was marked in this manner."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> Marshall, towards the close of the last
    century, in speaking of a change in one of the Yorkshire breeds of
    cattle, says the horns have been considerably modified, as "a
    clean, small, sharp horn has been <I>fashionable</I> for the last
    twenty years."<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> In a part of
    Germany the cattle of the Race de Gfoehl are valued for many good
    qualities, but they must have horns of a particular curvature and
    tint, so much so that mechanical means are applied if they take a
    wrong direction; but the inhabitants "consider it of the highest
    importance that the nostrils of the bull should be flesh-coloured,
    and the eyelashes light; this is an indispensable condition. A calf
    with blue nostrils would not be purchased, or purchased at a very
    low price."<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> Therefore let no man
    say that any point or character is too trifling to be methodically
    attended to and selected by breeders.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Unconscious Selection.</I>&#8212;By this term
    I mean, as already more than once explained, the preservation by
    man of the most valued, and the destruction of the least valued
    individuals, without any conscious intention on his part of
    altering the breed. It is difficult to offer direct proofs of the
    results which follow from this kind of selection; but the indirect
    evidence is abundant. In fact, except that in the one case man acts
    intentionally, and in the other unintentionally, there is little
    difference between methodical and unconscious selection. In both
    cases man preserves the animals which are most useful or pleasing
    to him, and destroys or neglects the others. But no doubt a far
    more rapid result follows from methodical than from unconscious
    selection. The "roguing" of plants by gardeners, and the
    destruction by law in Henry VIII.'s reign of all under-sized mares,
    are instances of a process the reverse of selection in the ordinary
    sense of the word, but leading to the same general result. The
    influence of the destruction of individuals having a particular
    character is well shown by the necessity of killing every lamb with
    a trace of black about it, in order to keep the flock white; or
    again, by the effects on the average height of the men of France of
    the destructive wars of Napoleon, by which many tall men were
    killed, the short ones being left to be the fathers of families.
    This at least is the conclusion of some of those who have closely
    studied the effects of the conscription; and it is certain that
    since Napoleon's time the standard for the army has been lowered
    two or three times.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Unconscious selection blends with methodical, so
    that it is scarcely possible to separate them. When a fancier long
    ago first happened to notice a pigeon with an unusually short beak,
    or one with the tail-feathers unusually developed, although he bred
    from these birds with the distinct intention of propagating the
    variety, yet he could not have intended to make a short-faced
    tumbler or a fantail, and was far from knowing that he had made the
    first step towards this end. If he could have seen the final
    result, he would have been struck with astonishment, but, from what
    we know of the habits of fanciers, probably not with admiration.
    Our English carriers, barbs, and short-faced tumblers have been
    greatly modified in the same manner, as we may infer both from the
    historical evidence given in the chapters on the Pigeon, and from
    the comparison of birds brought from distant countries.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">So it has been with dogs; our present fox-hounds
    differ from the old English hound; our greyhounds have become
    lighter: the Scotch deer-hound has been modified, and is now rare.
    Our bulldogs differ from those which were formerly used for baiting
    bulls. Our pointers and Newfoundlands do not closely resemble any
    native dog now found in the countries whence they were brought.
    These changes have been effected partly by crosses; but in every
    case the result has been governed by the strictest selection.
    Nevertheless, there is no reason to suppose that man intentionally
    and methodically made the breeds exactly what they now are. As our
    horses became fleeter, and the country more cultivated and
    smoother, fleeter fox-hounds were desired and produced, but
    probably without any one distinctly foreseeing what they would
    become. Our pointers and setters, the latter almost certainly
    descended from large spaniels, have been greatly modified in
    accordance with fashion and the desire for increased speed. Wolves
    have become extinct, and so has the wolf-dog; deer have become
    rarer, bulls are no longer baited, and the corresponding breeds of
    the dog have answered to the change. But we may feel almost sure
    that when, for instance, bulls were no longer baited, no man said
    to himself, I will now breed my dogs of smaller size, and thus
    create the present race. As circumstances changed, men
    unconsciously and slowly modified their course of selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With racehorses selection for swiftness has been
    followed methodically, and our horses now easily surpass their
    progenitors. The increased size and different appearance of the
    English racehorse led a good observer in India to ask," Could any
    one in this year of 1856, looking at our racehorses, conceive that
    they were the result of the union of the Arab horse and the African
    mare?"<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> This change has, it is
    probable, been largely effected through unconscious selection, that
    is, by the general wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each
    generation, combined with training and high feeding, but without
    any intention to give to them their present appearance. According
    to Youatt,<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> the introduction in
    Oliver Cromwell's time of three celebrated Eastern stallions
    speedily affected the English breed; "so that Lord Harleigh, one of
    the old school, complained that the great horse was fast
    disappearing." This is an excellent proof how carefully selection
    must have been attended to; for without such care, all traces of so
    small an infusion of Eastern blood would soon have been absorbed
    and lost. Notwithstanding that the climate of England has never
    been esteemed particularly favourable to the horse, yet
    long-continued selection, both methodical and unconscious, together
    with that practised by the Arabs during a still longer and earlier
    period, has ended in giving us the best breed of horses in the
    world. Macaulay<A href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> remarks, "Two men
    whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem, the Duke
    of Newcastle and Sir John Fenwick, pronounced that the meanest hack
    ever imported from Tangier would produce a finer progeny than could
    be expected from the best sire of our native breed. They would not
    readily have believed that a time would come when the princes and
    nobles of neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses
    from England as ever the English had been to obtain horses from
    Barbary."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The London dray-horse, which differs so much in
    appearance from any natural species, and which from its size has so
    astonished many Eastern princes, was probably formed by the
    heaviest and most powerful animals having been selected during many
    generations in Flanders and England, but without the least
    intention or expectation of creating a horse such as we now see. If
    we go back to an early period of history, we behold in the antique
    Greek statues, as Schaaffhausen has remarked,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> a horse equally unlike a race or dray
    horse, and differing from any existing breed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The results of unconscious selection, in an
    early stage, are well shown in the difference between the flocks
    descended from the same stock, but separately reared by careful
    breeders. Youatt gives an excellent instance of this fact in the
    sheep belonging to Messrs. Buckley and Burgess, which "have been
    purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of
    fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any
    one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either
    flock has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr.
    Bakewell's flock; yet the difference between the sheep possessed by
    these two gentlemen is so great, that they have the appearance of
    being quite different varieties."<A href="#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
    I have seen several analogous and well marked cases with pigeons:
    for instance, I had a family of barbs descended from those long
    bred by Sir J. Sebright, and another family long bred by another
    fancier, and the two families plainly differed from each other.
    Nathusius&#8212;and a more competent witness could not be
    cited&#8212;observes that, though the Shorthorns are remarkably
    uniform in appearance (except in colour), yet the individual
    character and wishes of each breeder become impressed on his
    cattle, so that different herds differ slightly from one another.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> The Hereford cattle assumed their
    present well-marked character soon after the year 1769, through

    and the breed has lately split into two strains&#8212;one strain
    having a white face, and differing slightly, it is said,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> in some other points: but there is no
    reason to believe that this split, the origin of which is unknown,
    was intentionally made; it may with much more probability be
    attributed to different breeders having attended to different
    points. So again, the Berkshire breed of swine in the year 1810 had
    greatly changed from what it was in 1780; and since 1810 at least
    two distinct sub-breeds have arisen bearing the same name.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> Keeping in mind how rapidly all animals
    increase, and that some must be annually slaughtered and some saved
    for breeding, then, if the same breeder during a long course of
    years deliberately settles which shall be saved and which shall be
    killed, it is almost inevitable that his individual turn of mind
    will influence the character of his stock, without his having had
    any intention to modify the breed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Unconscious selection in the strictest sense of
    the word, that is, the saving of the more useful animals and the
    neglect or slaughter of the less useful, without any thought of the
    future, must have gone on occasionally from the remotest period and
    amongst the most barbarous nations. Savages often suffer from
    famines, and are sometimes expelled by war from their own homes. In
    such cases it can hardly be doubted that they would save their most
    useful animals. When the Fuegians are hard pressed by want, they
    kill their old women for food rather than their dogs; for, as we
    were assured, "old women no use&#8212;dogs catch otters." The same
    sound sense would surely lead them to preserve their more useful
    dogs when still harder pressed by famine. Mr. Oldfield, who has
    seen so much of the aborigines of Australia, informs me that "they
    are all very glad to get a European kangaroo dog, and several
    instances have been known of the father killing his own infant that
    the mother might suckle the much-prized puppy." Different kinds of
    dogs would be useful to the Australian for hunting opossums and
    kangaroos, and to the Fuegian for catching fish and otters; and the
    occasional preservation in the two countries of the most useful
    animals would ultimately lead to the formation of two widely
    distinct breeds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With plants, from the earliest dawn of
    civilisation, the best variety which was known would generally have
    been cultivated at each period and its seeds occasionally sown; so
    that there will have been some selection from an extremely remote
    period, but without any prefixed standard of excellence or thought
    of the future. We at the present day profit by a course of
    selection occasionally and unconsciously carried on during
    thousands of years. This is proved in an interesting manner by
    Oswald Heer's researches on the lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, as
    given in a former chapter; for he shows that the grain and seed of
    our present varieties of wheat, barley, oats, peas, beans, lentils,
    and poppy, exceed in size those which were cultivated in
    Switzerland during the Neolithic and Bronze periods. These ancient
    people, during the Neolithic period, possessed also a crab
    considerably larger than that now growing wild on the Jura.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> The pears described by Pliny were
    evidently extremely inferior in quality to our present pears. We
    can realise the effects of long-continued selection and cultivation
    in another way, for would any one in his senses expect to raise a
    first-rate apple from the seed of a truly wild crab, or a luscious
    melting pear from the wild pear? Alphonse de Candolle informs me
    that he has lately seen on an ancient mosaic at Rome a
    representation of the melon; and as the Rotnans, who were such
    gourmands, are silent on this fruit, he infers that the melon has
    been greatly ameliorated since the classical period.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Coming to later times, Buffon<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> on comparing the flowers, fruit, and
    vegetables which were then cultivated with some excellent drawings
    made a hundred and fifty years previously, was struck with surprise
    at the great improvement which had been effected; and remarks that
    these ancient flowers and vegetables would now be rejected, not
    only by a florist but by a village gardener. Since the time of
    Buffon the work of improvement has steadily and rapidly gone on.
    Every florist who compares our present flowers with those figured
    in books published not long since, is astonished at the change. A
    well-known amateur,<A href="#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> in speaking
    of the varieties of Pelargonium raised by Mr. Garth only twenty-two
    years before, remarks, "What a rage they excited: surely we had
    attained perfection, it was said; and now not one of the flowers of
    those days will be looked at. But none the less is the debt of
    gratitude which we owe to those who saw what was to be done, and
    did it." Mr. Paul, the well-known horticulturist, in writing of the
    same flower,<A href="#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> says he remembers
    when young being delighted with the portraits in Sweet's work; "but
    what are they in point of beauty compared with the Pelargoniums of
    this day? Here again nature did not advance by leaps; the
    improvement was gradual, and if we had neglected those very gradual
    advances, we must have foregone the present grand results." How
    well this practical horticulturist appreciates and illustrates the
    gradual and accumulative force of selection! The Dahlia has
    advanced in beauty in a like manner; the line of improvement being
    guided by fashion, and by the successive modifications which the
    flower slowly underwent.<A href="#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> A steady
    and gradual change has been noticed in many other flowers: thus an
    old florist,<A href="#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> after describing the
    leading varieties of the Pink which were grown in 1813 adds, "the
    pinks of those days would now be scarcely grown as border-flowers."
    The improvement of so many flowers and the number of the varieties
    which have been raised is all the more striking when we hear that
    the earliest known flower-garden in Europe, namely at Padua, dates
    only from the year 1545.<A href="#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Effects of Selection, as shown by the parts
    most valued by man presenting the greatest amount of
    difference.</I>&#8212;The power of long-continued selection,
    whether methodical or unconscious, or both combined, is well shown
    in a general way, namely, by the comparison of the differences
    between the varieties of distinct species, which are valued for
    different parts, such as for the leaves, or stems, or tubers, the
    seed, or fruit, or flowers. Whatever part man values most, that
    part will be found to present the greatest amount of difference.
    With trees cultivated for their fruit, Sageret remarks that the
    fruit is larger than in the parent-species, whilst with those
    cultivated for the seed, as with nuts, walnuts, almonds, chestnuts,
    etc., it is the seed itself which is larger; and he accounts for
    this fact by the fruit in the one case, and by the seed in the
    other, having been carefully attended to and selected during many
    ages. Gallesio has made the same observation. Godron insists on the
    diversity of the tuber in the potato, of the bulb in the onion, and
    of the fruit in the melon; and on the close similarity of the other
    parts in these same plants.<A href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In order to judge how far my own impression on
    this subject was correct, I cultivated numerous varieties of the
    same species close to one another. The comparison of the amount of
    difference between widely different organs is necessarily vague; I
    will therefore give the results in only a few cases. We have
    previously seen in the ninth chapter how greatly the varieties of
    the cabbage differ in their foliage and stems, which are the
    selected parts, and how closely they resemble one another in their
    flowers, capsules, and seeds. In seven varieties of the radish, the
    roots differed greatly in colour and shape, but no difference
    whatever could be detected in their foliage, flowers, or seeds. Now
    what a contrast is presented, if we compare the flowers of the
    varieties of these two plants with those of any species cultivated
    in our flower-gardens for ornament; or if we compare their seeds
    with those of the varieties of maize, peas, beans, etc., which are
    valued and cultivated for their seeds. In the ninth chapter it was
    shown that the varieties of the pea differ but little except in the
    tallness of the plant, moderately in the shape of the pod, and
    greatly in the pea itself, and these are all selected points. The
    varieties, however, of the <I>Pois sans parchemin</I> differ much
    more in their pods, and these are eaten and valued. I cultivated
    twelve varieties of the common bean; one alone, the Dwarf Fan,
    differed considerably in general appearance; two differed in the
    colour of their flowers, one being an albino, and the other being
    wholly instead of partially purple; several differed considerably
    in the shape and size of the pod, but far more in the bean itself,
    and this is the valued and selected part. Toker's bean, for
    instance, is twice-and-a-half as long and broad as the horse-bean,
    and is much thinner and of a different shape.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The varieties of the gooseberry, as formerly
    described, differ much in their fruit, but hardly perceptibly in
    their flowers or organs of vegetation. With the plum, the
    differences likewise appear to be greater in the fruit than in the
    flowers or leaves. On the other hand, the seed of the strawberry,
    which corresponds with the fruit of the plum, differs hardly at
    all; whilst every one knows how greatly the fruit&#8212;that is,
    the enlarged receptacle&#8212;differs in several varieties. In
    apples, pears, and peaches the flowers and leaves differ
    considerably, but not, as far as I can judge, in proportion with
    the fruit. The Chinese double-flowering peaches, on the other hand,
    show that varieties of this tree have been formed, which differ
    more in flower than in fruit. If, as is highly probable, the peach
    is the modified descent of the almond, a surprising amount of
    change has been effected in the same species, in the fleshy
    covering of the former and in the kernels of the latter.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When parts stand in close relationship to each
    other, such as the seed and the fleshy covering of the fruit
    (whatever its homological nature may be), changes in the one are
    usually accompanied by modifications in the other, though not
    necessarily to the same degree. With the plum-tree, for instance,
    some varieties produce plums which are nearly alike, but include
    stones extremely dissimilar in shape; whilst conversely other
    varieties produce dissimilar fruit with barely distinguishable
    stones; and generally the stones, though they have never been
    subjected to selection, differ greatly in the several varieties of
    the plum. In other cases organs which are not manifestly related,
    through some unknown bond vary together, and are consequently
    liable, without any intention on man's part, to be simultaneously
    acted on by selection. Thus the varieties of the stock (Matthiola)
    have been selected solely for the beauty of their flowers, but the
    seeds differ greatly in colour and somewhat in size. Varieties of
    the lettuce have been selected solely on account of their leaves,
    yet produce seeds which likewise differ in colour. Generally,
    through the law of correlation, when a variety differs greatly from
    its fellow-varieties in any one character, it differs to a certain
    extent in several other characters. I observed this fact when I
    cultivated together many varieties of the same species, for I used
    first to make a list of the varieties which differed most from each
    other in their foliage and manner of growth, afterwards of those
    that differed most in their flowers, then in their seed-capsules,
    and lastly in their mature seed; and I found that the same names
    generally occurred in two, three, or four of the successive lists.
    Nevertheless the greatest amount of difference between the
    varieties was always exhibited, as far as I could judge, by that
    part or organ for which the plant was cultivated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When we bear in mind that each plant was at
    first cultivated because useful to man, and that its variation was
    a subsequent, often a long subsequent, event, we cannot explain the
    greater amount of diversity in the valuable parts by supposing that
    species endowed with an especial tendency to vary in any particular
    manner were originally chosen. We must attribute the result to the
    variations in these parts having been successively preserved, and
    thus continually augmented; whilst other variations, excepting such
    as inevitably appeared through correlation, were neglected and
    lost. We may therefore infer that most plants might be made,
    through long-continued selection, to yield races as different from
    one another in any character as they now are in those parts for
    which they are valued and cultivated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With animals we see nothing of the same kind;
    but a sufficient number of species have not been domesticated for a
    fair comparison. Sheep are valued for their wool, and the wool
    differs much more in the several races than the hair in cattle.
    Neither sheep, goats, European cattle, nor pigs are valued for
    their fleetness or strength; and we do not possess breeds differing
    in these respects like the racehorse and dray-horse. But fleetness
    and strength are valued in camels and dogs; and we have with the
    former the swift dromedary and heavy camel; with the latter the
    greyhound and mastiff. But dogs are valued even in a higher degree
    for their mental qualities and senses; and every one knows how
    greatly the races differ in these respects. On the other hand,
    where the dog is kept solely to serve for food, as in the
    Polynesian islands and China, it is described as an extremely
    stupid animal.<A href="#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> Blumenbach remarks
    that "many dogs, such as the badger-dog, have a build so marked and
    so appropriate for particular purposes, that I should find it very
    difficult to persuade myself that this astonishing figure was an
    accidental consequence of degeneration."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>90</SUP></A> Had Blumenbach reflected on the great
    principle of selection, he would not have used the term
    degeneration, and he would not have been astonished that dogs and
    other animals should become excellently adapted for the service of
    man.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the whole we may conclude that whatever part
    or character is most valued&#8212;whether the leaves, stems,
    tubers, bulbs, flowers, fruit, or seed of plants, or the size,
    strength, fleetness, hairy covering, or intellect of
    animals&#8212;that character will almost invariably be found to
    present the greatest amount of difference both in kind and degree.
    And this result may be safely attributed to man having preserved
    during a long course of generations the variations which were
    useful to him, and neglected the others.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will conclude this chapter by some remarks on
    an important subject. With animals such as the giraffe, of which
    the whole structure is admirably co-ordinated for certain purposes,
    it has been supposed that all the parts must have been
    simultaneously modified; and it has been argued that, on the
    principle of natural selection, this is scarcely possible. But in
    thus arguing, it has been tacitly assumed that the variations must
    have been abrupt and great. No doubt, if the neck of a ruminant
    were suddenly to become greatly elongated, the fore limbs and back
    would have to be simultaneously strengthened and modified; but it
    cannot be denied that an animal might have its neck, or head, or
    tongue, or fore-limbs elongated a very little without any
    corresponding modification in other parts of the body; and animals
    thus slightly modified would, during a dearth, have a slight
    advantage, and be enabled to browse on higher twigs, and thus
    survive. A few mouthfuls more or less every day would make all the
    difference between life and death. By the repetition of the same
    process, and by the occasional intercrossing of the survivors,
    there would be some progress, slow and fluctuating though it would
    be, towards the admirably coordinated structure of the giraffe. If
    the short-faced tumbler-pigeon, with its small conical beak,
    globular head, rounded body, short wings, and small
    feet&#8212;characters which appear all in harmony&#8212;had been a
    natural species, its whole structure would have been viewed as well
    fitted for its life; but in this case we know that inexperienced
    breeders are urged to attend to point after point, and not to
    attempt improving the whole structure at the same time. Look at the
    greyhound, that perfect image of grace, symmetry, and vigour; no
    natural species can boast of a more admirably co-ordinated
    structure, with its tapering head, slim body, deep chest, tucked-up
    abdomen, rat-like tail, and long muscular limbs, all adapted for
    extreme fleetness, and for running down weak prey. Now, from what
    we see of the variability of animals, and from what we know of the
    method which different men follow in improving their
    stock&#8212;some chiefly attending to one point, others to another
    point, others again correcting defects by crosses, and so
    forth&#8212;we may feel assured that if we could see the long line
    of ancestors of a first-rate greyhound up to its wild wolf-like
    progenitor, we should behold an infinite number of the finest
    gradations, sometimes in one character and sometimes in another,
    but all leading towards our present perfect type. By small and
    doubtful steps such as these, nature, as we may confidently
    believe, has progressed, on her grand march of improvement and
    development.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A similar line of reasoning is as applicable to
    separate organs as to the whole organisation. A writer<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> has recently maintained that "it is
    probably no exaggeration to suppose that in order to improve such
    an organ as the eye at all, it must be improved in ten different
    ways at once. And the improbability of any complex organ being
    produced and brought to perfection in any such way is an
    improbability of the same kind and degree as that of producing a
    poem or a mathematical demonstration by throwing letters at random
    on a table." If the eye were abruptly and greatly modified, no
    doubt many parts would have to be simultaneously altered, in order
    that the organ should remain serviceable.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But is this the case with smaller changes? There
    are persons who can see distinctly only in a dull light, and this
    condition depends, I believe, on the abnormal sensitiveness of the
    retina, and is known to be inherited. Now if a bird, for instance,
    receive some great advantage from seeing well in the twilight, all
    the individuals with the most sensitive retina would succeed best
    and be the most likely to survive; and why should not all those
    which happened to have the eye itself a little larger, or the pupil
    capable of greater dilatation, be likewise preserved, whether or
    not these modifications were strictly simultaneous? These
    individuals would subsequently intercross and blend their
    respective advantages. By such slight successive changes, the eye
    of a diurnal bird would be brought into the condition of that of an
    owl, which has often been advanced as an excellent instance of
    adaptation. Short-sight, which is often inherited, permits a person
    to see distinctly a minute object at so near a distance that it
    would be indistinct to ordinary eyes; and here we have a capacity
    which might be serviceable under certain conditions, abruptly
    gained. The Fuegians on board the Beagle could certainly see
    distant objects more distinctly than our sailors with all their
    long practice; I do not know whether this depends upon
    sensitiveness or on the power of adjustment in the focus; but this
    capacity for distant vision might, it is probable, be slightly
    augmented by successive modifications of either kind. Amphibious
    animals which are enabled to see both in the water and in the air,
    require and possess, as M. Plateau has shown,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> eyes constructed on the following plan:
    "the cornea is always flat, or at least much flattened in the front
    of the crystalline and over a space equal to the diameter of that
    lens, whilst the lateral portions may be much curved." The
    crystalline is very nearly a sphere, and the humours have nearly
    the same density as water. Now as a terrestrial animal became more
    and more aquatic in its habits, very slight changes, first in the
    curvature of the cornea or crystalline, and then in the density of
    the humours, or conversely, might successively occur, and would be
    advantageous to the animal whilst under water, without serious
    detriment to its power of vision in the air. It is of course
    impossible to conjecture by what steps the fundamental structure of
    the eye in the Vertebrata was originally acquired, for we know
    nothing about this organ in the first progenitors of the class.
    With respect to the lowest animals in the scale, the transitional
    states through which the eye at first probably passed, can by the
    aid of analogy be indicated, as I have attempted to show in my
    'Origin of Species.'<A href="#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A></P>
