    <P align="JUSTIFY">This chapter will be chiefly devoted to a
    subject in many respects important, namely, bud-variation. By this
    term I include all those sudden changes in structure or appearance
    which occasionally occur in full-grown plants in their flower-buds
    or leaf-buds. Gardeners call such changes "Sports;" but this, as
    previously remarked, is an ill-defined expression, as it has often
    been applied to strongly marked variations in seedling plants. The
    difference between seminal and bud reproduction is not so great as
    it at first appears; for each bud is in one sense a new and
    distinct individual; but such individuals are produced through the
    formation of various kinds of buds without the aid of any special
    apparatus, whilst fertile seeds are produced by the concourse of
    the two sexual elements. The modifications which arise through
    bud-variation can generally be propagated to any extent by
    grafting, budding, cuttings, bulbs, etc., and occasionally even by
    seed. Some few of our most beautiful and useful productions have
    arisen by bud-variation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Bud-variations have as yet been observed only in
    the vegetable kingdom; but it is probable that if compound animals,
    such as corals, etc., had been subjected to a long course of
    domestication, they would have varied by buds; for they resemble
    plants in many respects. For instance, any new or peculiar
    character presented by a compound animal is propagated by budding,
    as occurs with differently coloured Hydras, and as Mr. Gosse has
    shown to be the case with a singular variety of a true coral.
    Varieties of the Hydra have also been grafted on other varieties,
    and have retained their character.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will in the first place give all the cases of
    bud variations which I have been able to collect, and afterwards
    show their importance.<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> These cases
    prove that those authors who, like Pallas, attribute all
    variability to the crossing either of distinct races, or of
    distinct individuals belonging to the same race but somewhat
    different from each other, are in error; as are those authors who
    attribute all variability to the mere act of sexual union. Nor can
    we account in all cases for the appearance through bud-variation of
    new characters by the principle of reversion to long-lost
    characters. He who wishes to judge how far the conditions of life
    directly cause each particular variation ought to reflect well on
    the cases immediately to be given. I will commence with
    bud-variations, as exhibited in the fruit, and then pass on to
    flowers, and finally to leaves.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Peach (Amygdalus
    persica).</I>&#8212;In the last chapter I gave two cases of a
    peach-almond and a double-flowered almond which suddenly produced
    fruit closely resembling true peaches. I have also given many cases
    of peach-trees producing buds, which, when developed into branches,
    have yielded nectarines. We have seen that no less than six named
    and several unnamed varieties of the peach have thus produced
    several varieties of nectarine. I have shown that it is highly
    improbable that all these peach-trees, some of which are old
    varieties, and have been propagated by the million, are hybrids
    from the peach and nectarine, and that it is opposed to all analogy
    to attribute the occasional production of nectarines on peach-trees
    to the direct action of pollen from some neighbouring
    nectarine-tree. Several of the cases are highly remarkable,
    because, firstly, the fruit thus produced has sometimes been in
    part a nectarine and in part a peach; secondly, because nectarines
    thus suddenly produced have reproduced themselves by seed; and
    thirdly, because nectarines are produced from peach-trees from seed
    as well as from buds. The seed of the nectarine, on the other hand,
    occasionally produces peaches; and we have seen in one instance
    that a nectarine-tree yielded peaches by bud-variation. As the
    peach is certainly the oldest or primary variety, the production of
    peaches from nectarines, either by seeds or buds, may perhaps be
    considered as a case of reversion. Certain trees have also been
    described as indifferently bearing peaches or nectarines, and this
    may be considered as bud-variation carried to an extreme
    degree.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The <I>grosse mignonne</I> peach at
    Montreuil produced "from a sporting branch" the <I>grosse mignonne
    tardive,</I> "a most excellent variety," which ripens its fruit a
    fortnight later than the parent tree, and is equally good.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> This same peach has likewise produced by
    bud-variation the <I>early grosse mignonne.</I> Hunt's large tawny
    nectarine "originated from Hunt's small tawny nectarine, but not
    through seminal reproduction."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Plums.</I>&#8212;Mr. Knight states
    that a tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum, forty years old, which
    had always borne ordinary fruit, produced a branch which yielded
    red magnum bonums.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Mr. Rivers, of
    Sawbridgeworth, informs me (Jan. 1863) that a single tree out of
    400 or 500 trees of the Early Prolific plum, which is a purple
    kind, descended from an old French variety bearing purple fruit,
    produced when about ten years old bright yellow plums; these
    differed in no respect except colour from those on the other trees,
    but were unlike any other known kind of yellow plum.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Cherry (Prunus cerasus).</I>&#8212;Mr.
    Knight has recorded (ibid.) the case of a branch of a May-Duke
    cherry, which, though certainly never grafted, always produced
    fruit, ripening later, and more oblong than the fruit on the other
    branches. Another account has been given of two May-Duke
    cherry-trees in Scotland, with branches bearing oblong and very
    fine fruit, which invariably ripened, as in Knight's case, a
    fortnight later than the other cherries.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> M. Carri&#232;re gives (p. 37) numerous
    analogous cases, and one of the same tree bearing three kinds of
    fruit.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Grapes (Vitis vinifera).</I>&#8212;The
    black or purple Frontignan in one case produced during two
    successive years (and no doubt permanently), spurs which bore white
    Frontignan grapes. In another case, on the same footstalk, the
    lower berries "were well-coloured black Frontignans; those next the
    stalk were white, with the exception of one black and one streaked
    berry;" and altogether there were fifteen black and twelve white
    berries on the same stalk. In another kind of grape, black and
    amber-coloured berries were produced in the same cluster.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Count Odart describes a variety which
    often bears on the same stalk small round and large oblong berries;
    though the shape of the berry is generally a fixed character.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Here is another striking case given
    on the excellent authority of M. Carri&#232;re:<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> "a black Hamburg grape (Frankenthal) was
    cut down, and produced three suckers; one of these was layered, and
    after a time produced much smaller berries, which always ripened at
    least a fortnight earlier than the others. Of the remaining two
    suckers, one produced every year fine grapes, whilst the other,
    although it set an abundance of fruit, matured only a few, and
    these of inferior quality."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Gooseberry (Ribes
    grossularia).</I>&#8212;A remarkable case has been described by Dr.
    Lindley<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> of a bush which bore at
    the same time no less than four kinds of berries, namely, hairy and
    red,&#8212;smooth, small and red,&#8212;green,&#8212;and yellow
    tinged with buff; the two latter kinds had a different flavour from
    the red berries, and their seeds were coloured red. Three twigs on
    this bush grew close together; the first bore three yellow berries
    and one red; the second twig bore four yellow and one red; and the
    third four red and one yellow. Mr. Laxton also informs me that he
    has seen a Red Warrington gooseberry bearing both red and yellow
    fruit on the same branch.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Currant (Ribes rubrum).</I>&#8212;A
    bush purchased as the Champagne, which is a variety that bears
    blush-coloured fruit intermediate between red and white, produced
    during fourteen years on separate branches and mingled on the same
    branch, berries of the red, white, and champagne kinds.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> The suspicion naturally arises that this
    variety may have originated from a cross between a red and white
    variety, and that the above transformation may be accounted for by
    reversion to both parent-forms; but from the foregoing complex case
    of the gooseberry this view is doubtful. In France, a branch of a
    red-currant bush, about ten years old, produced near the summit
    five white berries) and lower down, amongst the red berries, one
    berry half red and half white.<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
    Alexander Braun<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> also has often
    seen branches on white currant-trees bearing red
    berries.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Pear (Pyrus
    communis).</I>&#8212;Dureau de la Malle states that the flowers on
    some trees of an ancient variety, the <I>doyenn&#233; galeux,</I>
    were destroyed by frost: other flowers appeared in July, which
    produced six pears; these exactly resembled in their skin and taste
    the fruit of a distinct variety, the <I>gros doyenne blanc,</I> but
    in shape were like the <I>bon-chr&#233;tien</I>: it was not
    ascertained whether this new variety could be propagated by budding
    or grafting. The same author grafted a <I>bon-chr&#233;tien</I> on
    a quince, and it produced, besides its proper fruit, an apparently
    new variety, of a peculiar form with thick and rough skin.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Apple (Pyrus malus).</I>&#8212;In
    Canada, a tree of the variety called Pound Sweet, produced,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> between two of its proper fruit, an
    apple which was well russeted, small in size, different in shape,
    and with a short peduncle. As no russet apple grew anywhere near,
    this case apparently cannot be accounted for by the direct action
    of foreign pollen. M. Carri&#232;re (p. 38) mentions an analogous
    instance. I shall hereafter give cases of apple-trees which
    regularly produce fruit of two kinds, or half-and-half fruit; these
    trees are generally supposed, and probably with truth, to be of
    crossed parentage, and that the fruit reverts to both
    parent-forms.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Banana (Musa
    sapientium).</I>&#8212;Sir R. Schomburgk states that he saw in St.
    Domingo a raceme on the Fig Banana which bore towards the base 125
    fruits of the proper kind; and these were succeeded, as is usual,
    higher up the raceme, by barren flowers, and these by 420 fruits,
    having a widely different appearance, and ripening earlier than the
    proper fruit. The abnormal fruit closely resembled, except in being
    smaller, that of the <I>Musa chinensis</I> or <I>cavendishii,</I>
    which has generally been ranked as a distinct species.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><B>Flowers.</B>&#8212;Many cases have
    been recorded of a whole plant, or single branch, or bud, suddenly
    producing flowers different from the proper type in colour, form,
    size, doubleness, or other character. Half the flower, or a smaller
    segment, sometimes changes colour.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Camellia.</I>&#8212;The myrtle-leaved
    species (<I>C. myrtifolia</I>), and two or three varieties of the
    common species, have been known to produce hexagonal and
    imperfectly quadrangular flowers; and the branches producing such
    flowers have been propagated by grafting.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> The Pompon variety often bears "four
    distinguishable kinds of flowers,&#8212;the pure white and the
    red-eyed, which appear promiscuously; the brindled pink and the
    rose-coloured, which may be kept separate with tolerable certainty
    by grafting from the branches that bear them." A branch, also, on
    an old tree of the rose-coloured variety has been seen to "revert
    to the pure white colour, an occurrence less common than the
    departure from it."<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Crat&#230;gus oxyacantha.</I>&#8212;A
    dark pink hawthorn has been known to throw out a single tuft of
    pure white blossoms;<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> and Mr. A.
    Clapham, nurseryman, of Bedford, informs me that his father had a
    deep crimson thorn grafted on a white thorn, which during several
    years, always bore, high above the graft, bunches of white, pink
    and deep crimson flowers.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Azalea indica</I> is well known often
    to produce new varieties by buds. I have myself seen several cases.
    A plant of <I>Azalea indica variegata</I> has been exhibited
    bearing a truss of flowers of A. ind. gledstanesii "as true as
    could possibly be produced, thus evidencing the origin of that fine
    variety." On another plant of <I>A. ind. variegata</I> a perfect
    flower of <I>A. ind. lateritia</I> was produced; so that both <I>
    gledstanesii</I> and <I>lateritia</I> no doubt originally appeared
    as sporting branches of <I>A. ind. variegata.</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Hibiscus (Paritium
    tricuspis).</I>&#8212;A seedling of this plant, when some years
    old, produced, at Saharunpore,<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
    some branches "which bore leaves and flowers widely different from
    the normal form." "The abnormal leaf is much less divided, and not
    acuminated. The petals are considerably larger, and quite entire.
    There is also in the fresh state a conspicuous, large, oblong
    gland, full of a viscid secretion, on the back of each of the
    calycine segments." Dr. King, who subsequently had charge of these
    Gardens, informs me that a tree of <I>Paritium tricuspis</I>
    (probably the very same plant) growing there, had a branch buried
    in the ground, apparently by accident; and this branch changed its
    character wonderfully, growing like a bush, and producing flowers
    and leaves, resembling in shape those of another species, viz., <I>
    P. tiliaceum.</I> A small branch springing from this bush near the
    ground, reverted to the parent-form. Both forms were extensively
    propagated during several years by cuttings and kept perfectly
    true.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Alth&#230;a rosea.</I>&#8212;A double
    yellow Hollyhock suddenly turned one year into a pure white single
    kind; subsequently a branch bearing the original double yellow
    flowers reappeared in the midst of the branches of the single white
    kind.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Pelargonium.</I>&#8212;These highly
    cultivated plants seem eminently liable to bud-variation. I will
    give only a few well-marked cases. G&#228;rtner has seen<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> a plant of <I>P. zonale</I> with a
    branch having white edges, which remained constant for years, and
    bore flowers of a deeper red than usual. Generally speaking, such
    branches present little or no difference in their flowers: thus a
    writer<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> pinched off the leading
    shoot of a seedling <I>P. zonale,</I> and it threw out three
    branches, which differed in the size and colour of their leaves and
    stems; but on all three branches "the flowers were identical,"
    except in being largest in the green-stemmed variety, and smallest
    in that with variegated foliage: these three varieties were
    subsequently propagated and distributed. Many branches, and some
    whole plants, of a variety called <I>compactum,</I> which bears
    orange-scarlet flowers, have been seen to produce pink flowers.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> Hill's Hector, which is a pale red
    variety, produced a branch with lilac flowers, and some trusses
    with both red and lilac flowers. This apparently is a case of
    reversion, for Hill's Hector was a seedling from a lilac variety.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> Here is a better case of reversion:
    a variety produced from a complicated cross, after having been
    propagated for five generations by seed, yielded by bud-variation
    three very distinct varieties which were undistinguishable from
    plants, "known to have been at some time ancestors of the plant in
    question."<A href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> Of all Pelargoniums,
    Rollisson's Unique seems to be the most sportive; its origin is not
    positively known, but is believed to be from a cross. Mr. Salter,
    of Hammersmith, states<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> that he
    has himself known this purple variety to produce the lilac, the
    rose-crimson or <I>conspicuum,</I> and the red or <I>coccineum</I>
    varieties; the latter has also produced the <I>rose d'amour</I>; so
    that altogether four varieties have originated by bud variation
    from Rollisson's Unique. Mr. Salter remarks that these four
    varieties "may now be considered as fixed, although they
    occasionally produce flowers of the original colour. This year <I>
    coccineum</I> has pushed flowers of three different colours, red,
    rose, and lilac, upon the same truss, and upon other trusses are
    flowers half red and half lilac." Besides these four varieties, two
    other scarlet Uniques are known to exist, both of which
    occasionally produce lilac flowers identical with Rollisson's
    Unique;<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> but one at least of these
    did not arise through bud-variation, but is believed to be a
    seedling from Rollisson's Unique.<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
    There are, also, in the trade<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> two
    other slightly different varieties, of unknown origin, of
    Rollisson's Unique: so that altogether we have a curiously complex
    case of variation both by buds and seeds.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> Here is a still more complex case: M.
    Rafarin states that a pale rose-coloured variety produced a branch
    bearing deep red flowers. "Cuttings were taken from this 'sport,'
    from which 20 plants were raised, which flowered in 1867, when it
    was found that scarcely two were alike." Some resembled the
    parent-form, some resembled the sport, some bore both kinds of
    flowers; and even some of the petals on the same flower were
    rose-coloured and others red.<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> An
    English wild plant, the <I>Geranium pratense,</I> when cultivated
    in a garden, has been seen to produce on the same plant both blue
    and white, and striped blue and white flowers.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Chrysanthemum.</I>&#8212;This plant
    frequently sports, both by its lateral branches and occasionally by
    suckers. A seedling raised by Mr. Salter has produced by
    bud-variation six distinct sorts, five different in colour and one
    in foliage, all of which are now fixed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> A variety called <I>cedo nulli</I> bears
    small yellow flowers, but habitually produces branches with white
    flowers; and a specimen was exhibited, which Prof. T. Dyer saw,
    before the Horticultural Society. The varieties which were first
    introduced from China were so excessively variable, "that it was
    extremely difficult to tell which was the original colour of the
    variety, and which was the sport." The same plant would produce one
    year only buff-coloured, and next year only rose-coloured flowers;
    and then would change again, or produce at the same time flowers of
    both colours. These fluctuating varieties are now all lost, and,
    when a branch sports into a new variety, it can generally be
    propagated and kept true; but, as Mr. Salter remarks, "every sport
    should be thoroughly tested in different soils before it can be
    really considered as fixed, as many have been known to run back
    when planted in rich compost; but when sufficient care and time are
    expended in proving, there will exist little danger of subsequent
    disappointment." Mr. Salter informs me that with all the varieties
    the commonest kind of bud-variation is the production of yellow
    flowers, and, as this is the primordial colour, these cases may be
    attributed to reversion. Mr. Salter has given me a list of seven
    differently coloured chrysanthemums, which have all produced
    branches with yellow flowers; but three of them have also sported
    into other colours. With any change of colour in the flower, the
    foliage generally changes in a corresponding manner in lightness or
    darkness.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Another Compositous plant, namely,
    Centauria cyanus, when cultivated in a garden, not unfrequently
    produces on the same root flowers of four different colours, viz.,
    blue, white, dark-purple, and parti-coloured.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> The flowers of Anthemis also vary on the
    same plant.<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Roses.</I>&#8212;Many varieties of the
    Rose are known or are believed to have originated by
    bud-variation.<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> The common double
    moss-rose was imported into England from Italy about the year
    1735.<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> Its origin is unknown, but
    from analogy it probably arose from the Provence rose (<I>R.
    centifolia</I>) by bud-variation; for the branches of the common
    moss-rose have several times been known to produce Provence roses,
    wholly or partially destitute of moss: I have seen one such
    instance, and several others have been recorded.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> Mr. Rivers also informs me that he
    raised two or three roses of the Provence class from seed of the
    old single moss-rose;<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> and this
    latter kind was produced in 1807 by bud-variation from the common
    moss-rose. The white moss-rose was also produced in 1788 by an
    offset from the common red moss-rose: it was at first pale
    blush-coloured, but became white by continued budding. On cutting
    down the shoots which had produced this white moss-rose, two weak
    shoots were thrown up, and buds from these yielded the beautiful
    striped moss-rose. The common moss-rose has yielded by
    bud-variation, besides the old single red moss-rose, the old
    scarlet semi-double moss-rose, and the sage-leaf moss-rose, which
    "has a delicate shell-like form, and is of a beautiful blush
    colour; it is now (1852) nearly extinct."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> A white moss-rose has been seen to bear
    a flower half white and half pink.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> Although several moss-roses have thus
    certainly arisen by bud-variation, the greater number probably owe
    their origin to seed of moss-roses. For Mr. Rivers informs me that
    his seedlings from the old single moss-rose almost always produced
    moss-roses; and the old single moss-rose was, as we have seen, the
    product by bud-variation of the double moss-rose originally
    imported from Italy. That the original moss-rose was the product of
    bud-variation is probable, from the facts above given and from the
    de Meaux moss-rose (also a variety of <I>R. centifolia</I>)<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> having appeared as a sporting branch on
    the common rose de Meaux. Prof. Caspary has carefully described<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> the case of a six-year-old white
    moss-rose, which sent up several suckers, one of which was thorny,
    and produced red flowers, destitute of moss, exactly like those of
    the Provence rose (<I>R. centifolia</I>): another shoot bore both
    kinds of flowers, and in addition longitudinally striped flowers.
    As this white moss-rose had been grafted on the Provence rose,
    Prof. Caspary attributes the above changes to the influence of the
    stock; but from the facts already given, and from others to be
    given, bud-variation, with reversion, is probably a sufficient
    explanation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Many other instances could be added of
    roses varying by buds. The white Provence rose apparently
    originated in this way.<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> M.
    Carri&#232;re states (p. 36) that he himself knows of five
    varieties thus produced by the Baronne Pr&#233;vost. The double and
    highly-coloured Belladonna rose has produced by suckers both
    semi-double and almost single white roses;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> whilst suckers from one of these
    semi-double white roses reverted to perfectly characterised
    Belladonnas. In St. Domingo, varieties of the China rose propagated
    by cuttings often revert after a year or two into the old China
    rose.<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> Many cases have been
    recorded of roses suddenly becoming striped or changing their
    character by segments: some plants of the Comtesse de Chabrillant,
    which is properly rose-coloured, were exhibited in 1862,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> with crimson flakes on a rose ground. I
    have seen the Beauty of Billiard with a quarter and with half the
    flower almost white. 'The Austrian bramble <I>R. lutea</I> not
    rarely<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> produces branches with
    pure yellow flowers; and Prof. Henslow has seen exactly half the
    flower of a pure yellow, and I have seen narrow yellow streaks on a
    single petal, of which the rest was of the usual copper
    colour.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The following cases are highly
    remarkable. Mr. Rivers, as I am informed by him, possessed a new
    French rose with delicate smooth shoots, pale glaucous-green
    leaves, and semi-double pale flesh-coloured flowers striped with
    dark red; and on branches thus characterised there suddenly
    appeared in more than one instance, the famous old rose called the
    Baronne Prevost, with its stout thorny shoots, and immense,
    uniformly and richly coloured double flowers; so that in this case
    the shoots, leaves, and flowers, all at once changed their
    character by bud-variation. According to M. Verlot,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> a variety called <I>Rosa
    cannabifolia,</I> which has peculiarly shaped leaflets, and differs
    from every member of the family in the leaves being opposite
    instead of alternate, suddenly appeared on a plant of <I>R.
    alba</I> in the gardens of the Luxembourg. Lastly, "a running
    shoot" was observed by Mr. H. Curtis<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> on the old Aim&#233;e Vibert Noisette,
    and he budded it on Celine; thus a climbing Aim&#233;e Vibert was
    first produced and afterwards propagated.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Dianthus.</I>&#8212;It is quite common
    with the Sweet William (<I>D. barbatus</I>) to see differently
    coloured flowers on the same root; and I have observed on the same
    truss four differently coloured and shaded flowers. Carnations and
    pinks (<I>D. caryophyllus,</I> etc.) occasionally vary by layers;
    and some kinds are so little certain in character that they are
    called by floriculturists "catch-flowers."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> Mr. Dickson has ably discussed the
    "running" of particoloured or striped carnations, and says it
    cannot be accounted for by the compost in which they are grown:
    "layers from the same clean flower would come part of them clean
    and part foul, even when subjected to precisely the same treatment;
    and frequently one flower alone appears influenced by the taint,
    the remainder coming perfectly clean."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> This running of the parti-coloured
    flowers apparently is a case of reversion by buds to the original
    uniform tint of the species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will briefly mention some other cases
    of bud-variation to show how many plants belonging to many orders
    have varied in their flowers; and many others might be added. I
    have seen on a snap-dragon (<I>Antirrhinum majus</I>) white, pink,
    and striped flowers on the same plant, and branches with striped
    flowers on a red-coloured variety. On a double stock (<I>Matthiola
    incana</I>) I have seen a branch bearing single flowers; and on a
    dingy-purple double variety of the wall-flower (<I>Cheiranthus
    cheiri</I>), a branch which had reverted to the ordinary copper
    colour. On other branches of the same plant, some flowers were
    exactly divided across the middle, one half being purple and the
    other coppery; but some of the smaller petals towards the centre of
    these same flowers were purple longitudinally streaked with coppery
    colour, or coppery streaked with purple. A Cyclamen<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> has been observed to bear white and pink
    flowers of two forms, the one resembling the Persicum strain, and
    the other the Coum strain. <I>Oenothera biennis</I> has been seen<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> bearing flowers of three different
    colours. The hybrid <I>Gladiolus colvilii</I> occasionally bears
    uniformly coloured flowers, and one case is recorded<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> of all the flowers on a plant thus
    changing colour. A Fuchsia has been seen<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> bearing two kinds of flowers. <I>
    Mirabilis jalapa</I> is eminently sportive, sometimes bearing on
    the same root pure red, yellow, and white flowers, and others
    striped with various combinations of these three colours.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> The plants of the Mirabilis, which bear
    such extraordinarily variable flowers in most, probably in all,
    cases, owe their origin, as shown by Prof. Lecoq, to crosses
    between differently coloured varieties.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Leaves and Shoots.</I>&#8212;Changes,
    through bud-variation, in fruits and flowers have hitherto been
    treated of; incidentally some remarkable modifications in the
    leaves and shoots of the rose and Paritium, and in a lesser degree
    in the foliage of the Pelargonium and Chrysanthemum, have been
    noticed. I will now add a few more cases of variation in leaf-buds.
    Verlot<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> states that on <I>Aralia
    trifoliata,</I> which properly has leaves with three leaflets,
    branches frequently appear bearing simple leaves of various forms;
    these can be propagated by buds or by grafting, and have given
    rise, as he states, to several nominal species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to trees, the history of but
    few of the many varieties with curious or ornamental foliage is
    known; but several probably have originated by bud-variation. Here
    is one case:&#8212;An old ash-tree (<I>Fraxinus excelsior</I>) in
    the grounds of Necton, as Mr. Mason states, "for many years has had
    one bough of a totally different character to the rest of the tree,
    or of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being short-jointed and
    densely covered with foliage." It was ascertained that this variety
    could be propagated by grafts.<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
    The varieties of some trees with cut leaves, as the oak-leaved
    laburnum, the parsley-leaved vine, and especially the fern-leaved
    beech, are apt to revert by buds to the common forms.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> The fern-like leaves of the beech
    sometimes revert only partially, and the branches display here and
    there sprouts bearing common leaves, fern-like, and variously
    shaped leaves. Such cases differ but little from the so-called
    heterophyllus varieties, in which the tree habitually bears leaves
    of various forms; but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees
    have originated as seedlings. There is a sub-variety of the weeping
    willow with leaves rolled up into a spiral coil; and Mr. Masters
    states that a tree of this kind kept true in his garden for
    twenty-five years, and then threw out a single upright shoot
    bearing flat leaves.<A href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have often noticed single twigs and
    branches on beech and other trees with their leaves fully expanded
    before those on the other branches had opened; and as there was
    nothing in their exposure or character to account for this
    difference, I presume that they had appeared as bud-variations,
    like the early and late fruit-maturing varieties of the peach and
    nectarine.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Cryptogamic plants are liable to
    bud-variation, for fronds on the same fern often display remarkable
    deviations of structure. Spores, which are of the nature of buds,
    taken from such abnormal fronds, reproduce, with remarkable
    fidelity, the same variety, after passing through the sexual
    stage.<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to colour, leaves often
    become by bud-variation zoned, blotched, or spotted with white,
    yellow, and red; and this occasionally occurs even with plants in a
    state of nature. Variegation, however, appears still more
    frequently in plants produced from seed; even the cotyledons or
    seed-leaves being thus affected.<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
    There have been endless disputes whether variegation should be
    considered as a disease. In a future chapter we shall see that it
    is much influenced, both in the case of seedlings and of mature
    plants, by the nature of the soil. Plants which have become
    variegated as seedlings, generally transmit their character by seed
    to a large proportion of their progeny; and Mr. Salter has given me
    a list of eight genera in which this occurred.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> Sir F. Pollock has given me more precise
    information: he sowed seed from a variegated plant of <I>Ballota
    nigra</I> which was found growing wild, and thirty per cent of the
    seedlings were variegated; seed from these latter being sown, sixty
    per cent came up variegated. When branches become variegated by
    bud-variation, and the variety is attempted to be propagated by
    seed, the seedlings are rarely variegated: Mr. Salter found this to
    be the case with plants belonging to eleven genera, in which the
    greater number of the seedlings proved to be green-leaved; yet a
    few were slightly variegated, or were quite white, but none were
    worth keeping. Variegated plants, whether originally produced from
    seeds or buds, can generally be propagated by budding, grafting,
    etc.; but all are apt to revert by bud-variation to their ordinary
    foliage. This tendency, however, differs much in the varieties of
    even the same species; for instance, the golden-striped variety of
    <I>Euonymus japonicus</I> "is very liable to run back to the
    green-leaved, while the silver-striped variety hardly ever
    changes."<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> I have seen a variety
    of the holly, with its leaves having a central yellow patch, which
    had everywhere partially reverted to the ordinary foliage, so that
    on the same small branch there were many twigs of both kinds. In
    the pelargonium, and in some other plants, variegation is generally
    accompanied by some degree of dwarfing, as is well exemplified in
    the "Dandy" pelargonium. When such dwarf varieties sport back by
    buds or suckers to the ordinary foliage, the dwarfed stature still
    remains.<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> It is remarkable that
    plants propagated from branches which have reverted from variegated
    to plain leaves<A href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> do not always (or
    never, as one observer asserts) perfectly resemble the original
    plain-leaved plant from which the variegated branch arose: it seems
    that a plant, in passing by bud-variation from plain leaves to
    variegated, and back again from variegated to plain, is generally
    in some degree affected so as to assume a slightly different
    aspect.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Bud-variation by Suckers, Tubers, and
    Bulbs.</I>&#8212;All the cases hitherto given of bud-variation in
    fruits, flowers, leaves, and shoots, have been confined to buds on
    the stems or branches, with the exception of a few cases
    incidentally noticed of varying suckers in the rose, pelargonium,
    and chrysanthemum. I will now give a few instances of variation in
    subterranean buds, that is, by suckers, tubers, and bulbs; not that
    there is any essential difference between buds above and beneath
    the ground. Mr. Salter informs me that two variegated varieties of
    Phlox originated as suckers; but I should not have thought these
    worth mentioning, had not Mr. Salter found, after repeated trials,
    that he could not propagate them by "root-joints," whereas, the
    variegated <I>Tussilago farfara</I> can thus be safely
    propagated;<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> but this latter plant
    may have originated as a variegated seedling, which would account
    for its greater fixedness of character. The Barberry (<I>Berberis
    vulgaris</I>) offers an analogous case; there is a well-known
    variety with seedless fruit, which can be propagated by cuttings or
    layers; but suckers always revert to the common form, which
    produces fruit containing seeds.<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A>
    My father repeatedly tried this experiment, and always with the
    same result. I may here mention that maize and wheat sometimes
    produce new varieties from the stock or root, as does the
    sugar-cane.<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Turning now to tubers: in the common
    Potato (<I>Solanum tuberosum</I>) a single bud or eye sometimes
    varies and produces a new variety; or, occasionally, and this is a
    much more remarkable circumstance, all the eyes in a tuber vary in
    the same manner and at the same time, so that the whole tuber
    assumes a new character. For instance, a single eye in a tuber of
    the old <I>Forty-fold potato,</I> which is a purple variety, was
    observed<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> to become white; this
    eye was cut out and planted separately, and the kind has since been
    largely propagated. <I>Kemp's potato</I> is properly white, but a
    plant in Lancashire produced two tubers which were red, and two
    which were white; the red kind was propagated in the usual manner
    by eyes, and kept true to its new colour, and, being found a more
    productive variety, soon became widely known under the name of <I>
    Taylor's forty-fold.</I><A href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> The old
    <I>Forty-fold potato,</I> as already stated, is a purple variety;
    but a plant long cultivated on the same ground produced, not, as in
    the case above given, a single white eye, but a whole white tuber,
    which has since been propagated and keeps true.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> Several cases have been recorded of
    large portions of whole rows of potatoes slightly changing their
    character.<A href="#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Dahlias propagated by tubers under the
    hot climate of St. Domingo vary much; Sir R. Schomburgk gives the
    case of the "Butterfly variety," which the second year produced on
    the same plant "double and single flowers; here white petals edged
    with maroon; there of a uniform deep maroon."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> Mr. Bree also mentions a plant "which
    bore two different kinds of self-coloured flowers, as well as a
    third kind which partook of both colours beautifully intermixed."<A

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Considering how long and extensively many
    Bulbous plants have been cultivated, and how numerous are the
    varieties produced from seed, these plants have not perhaps varied
    so much by offsets,&#8212;that is, by the production of new
    bulbs,&#8212;as might have been expected. With the Hyacinth,
    however, several instances have been given by M. Carri&#232;re. A
    case also has been recorded of a blue variety which for three
    successive years gave offsets producing white flowers with a red
    centre.<A href="#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> Another hyacinth bore<A

    and a perfectly blue flower. I have seen a bulb producing at the
    same time one stalk or truss with fine blue flowers, another with
    fine red flowers, and a third with blue flowers on one side and red
    on the other; several of the flowers being also longitudinally
    striped red and blue.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. John Scott informs me that in 1862
    <I>Imatophyllum miniatum,</I> in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh,
    threw up a sucker which differed from the normal form, in the
    leaves being two-ranked instead of four-ranked. The leaves were
    also smaller, with the upper surface raised instead of being
    channelled.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the propagation of <I>Tulips,</I>
    seedlings are raised, called <I>selfs</I> or <I>breeders,</I>
    which, "consist of one plain colour on a white or yellow bottom.
    These, being cultivated on a dry and rather poor soil, become
    broken or variegated and produce new varieties. The time that
    elapses before they break varies from one to twenty years or more,
    and sometimes this change never takes place."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> The broken or variegated colours which
    give value to all tulips are due to bud-variation; for although the
    Bybloemens and some other kinds have been raised from several
    distinct breeders, yet all the Baguets are said to have come from a
    single breeder or seedling. This bud-variation, in accordance with
    the views of MM. Vilmorin and Verlot,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> is probably an attempt to revert to that
    uniform colour which is natural to the species. A tulip, however,
    which has already become broken, when treated with too strong
    manure, is liable to flush or lose by a second act of reversion its
    variegated colours. Some kinds, as Imperatrix Florum, are much more
    liable than others to flushing; and Mr. Dickson maintains<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> that this can no more be accounted for
    than the variation of any other plant. He believes that English
    growers, from care in choosing seed from broken flowers instead of
    from plain flowers, have to a certain extent diminished the
    tendency in flowers already broken to flushing or secondary
    reversion. <I>Iris xiphium,</I> according to M. Carri&#232;re (p.
    65), behaves in nearly the same manner, as do so many
    tulips.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>During two consecutive years all the
    early flowers in a bed of <I>Tigridia conchiflora</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> resembled those of the old <I>T.
    pavonia</I>; but the later flowers assumed their proper colour of
    fine yellow, spotted with crimson. An apparently authentic account
    has been published<A href="#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> of two forms
    of Hemerocallis, which have been universally considered as distinct
    species, changing into each other; for the roots of the
    large-flowered tawny <I>H. fulva,</I> being divided and planted in
    a different soil and place, produced the small-flowered <I>H.
    flava,</I> as well as some intermediate forms. It is doubtful
    whether such cases as these latter, as well as the "flushing" of
    broken tulips and the "running" of particoloured
    carnations,&#8212;that is, their more or less complete return to a
    uniform tint,&#8212;ought to be classed under bud-variation, or
    ought to be retained for the chapter in which I treat of the direct
    action of the conditions of life on organic beings. These cases,
    however, have this much in bud-variation, that the change is
    effected through buds and not through seminal reproduction. But, on
    the other hand, there is this difference&#8212;that in ordinary
    cases of bud-variation, one bud alone changes, whilst in the
    foregoing cases all the buds on the same plant were modified
    together. With the potato, we have seen an intermediate case, for
    all the eyes in one tuber simultaneously changed their
    character.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will conclude with a few allied cases,
    which may be ranked either under bud-variation, or under the direct
    action of the conditions of life. When the common Hepatica is
    transplanted from its native woods, the flowers change colour, even
    during the first year.<A href="#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A> It is
    notorious that the improved varieties of the Heartsease (<I>Viola
    tricolor</I>), when transplanted, often produce flowers widely
    different in size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a
    large uniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full
    flower, and it then produced much smaller, more elongated flowers,
    with the lower petals yellow; these were succeeded by flowers
    marked with large purple spots, and ultimately, towards the end of
    the same summer, by the original large dark purple flowers. The
    slight changes which some fruit-trees undergo from being grafted
    and regrafted on various stocks,<A href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A>
    were considered by Andrew Knight<A href="#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A>
    as closely allied to "sporting branches," or bud-variations. Again,
    we have the case of young fruit-trees changing their character as
    they grow old; seedling pears, for instance, lose with age their
    spines and improve in the flavour of their fruit. Weeping
    birch-trees, when grafted on the common variety, do not acquire a
    perfect pendulous habit until they grow old: on the other hand, I
    shall hereafter give the case of some weeping ashes which slowly
    and gradually assumed an upright habit of growth. All such changes,
    dependent on age, may be compared with the changes, alluded to in
    the last chapter, which many trees naturally undergo; as in the
    case of the Deodar and Cedar of Lebanon, which are unlike in youth,
    whilst they closely resemble each other in old age; and as with
    certain oaks, and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn.<A

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Graft-hybrids.</I>&#8212;Before giving a
    summary on Bud-variation I will discuss some singular and anomalous
    cases, which are more or less closely related to this same subject.
    I will begin with the famous case of Adam's laburnum or <I>Cytisus
    adami,</I> a form or hybrid intermediate between two very distinct
    species, namely, <I>C. laburnum</I> and <I>purpureus,</I> the
    common and purple laburnum; but as this tree has often been
    described, I will be as brief as I can.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Throughout Europe, in different soils and
    under different climates, branches on this tree have repeatedly and
    suddenly reverted to the two parent species in their flowers and
    leaves. To behold mingled on the same tree tufts of dingy-red,
    bright yellow, and purple flowers, borne on branches having widely
    different leaves and manner of growth, is a surprising sight. The
    same raceme sometimes bears two kinds of flowers; and I have seen a
    single flower exactly divided into halves, one side being bright
    yellow and the other purple; so that one half of the standard-petal
    was yellow and of larger size, and the other half purple and
    smaller. In another flower the whole corolla was bright yellow, but
    exactly half the calyx was purple. In another, one of the dingy-red
    wing-petals had a narrow bright yellow stripe on it; and lastly, in
    another flower, one of the stamens, which had become slightly
    foliaceous, was half yellow and half purple; so that the tendency
    to segregation of character or reversion affects even single parts
    and organs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> The most remarkable
    fact about this tree is that in its intermediate state, even when
    growing near both parent-species, it is quite sterile; but when the
    flowers become pure yellow or pure purple they yield seed. I
    believe that the pods from the yellow flowers yield a full
    complement of seed; they certainly yield a larger number. Two
    seedlings raised by Mr. Herbert from such seed<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> exhibited a purple tinge on the stalks
    of their flowers; but several seedlings raised by myself resembled
    in every character the common laburnum, with the exception that
    some of them had remarkably long racemes: these seedlings were
    perfectly fertile. That such purity of character and fertility
    should be suddenly reacquired from so hybridised and sterile a form
    is an astonishing phenomenon. The branches with purple flowers
    appear at first sight exactly to resemble those of <I>C.
    purpureus</I>; but on careful comparison I found that they differed
    from the pure species in the shoots being thicker, the leaves a
    little broader, and the flowers slightly shorter, with the corolla
    and calyx less brightly purple: the basal part of the
    standard-petal also plainly showed a trace of the yellow stain. So
    that the flowers, at least in this instance, had not perfectly
    recovered their true character; and in accordance with this, they
    were not perfectly fertile, for many of the pods contained no seed,
    some produced one, and very few contained as many as two seeds;
    whilst numerous pods on a tree of the pure <I>C. purpureus</I> in
    my garden contained three, four, and five fine seeds. The pollen,
    moreover, was very imperfect, a multitude of grains being small and
    shrivelled; and this is a singular fact; for, as we shall
    immediately see, the pollen-grains in the dingy-red and sterile
    flowers on the parent-tree, were, in external appearance, in a much
    better state, and included very few shrivelled grains. Although the
    pollen of the reverted purple flowers was in so poor a condition,
    the ovules were well formed, and the seeds, when mature, germinated
    freely with me. Mr. Herbert raised plants from seeds of the
    reverted purple flowers, and they differed a <I>very little</I>
    from the usual state of <I>C. purpureus.</I> Some which I raised in
    the same manner did not differ at all, either in the character of
    their flowers or of the whole bush, from the pure <I>C.
    purpureus.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Prof. Caspary has examined the ovules of
    the dingy-red and sterile flowers in several plants of <I>C.
    adami</I> on the Continent,<A href="#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A> and
    finds them generally monstrous. In three plants examined by me in
    England, the ovules were likewise monstrous, the nucleus varying
    much in shape, and projecting irregularly beyond the proper coats.
    The pollen grains, on the other hand, judging from their external
    appearance, were remarkably good, and readily protruded their
    tubes. By repeatedly counting, under the microscope, the
    proportional number of bad grains, Prof. Caspary ascertained that
    only 2&#183;5 per cent were bad, which is a less proportion than in
    the pollen of three pure species of Cytisus in their cultivated
    state, viz., <I>C. purpureus, laburnum,</I> and <I>alpinus.</I>
    Although the pollen of <I>C. adami</I> is thus in appearance good,
    it does not follow, according to M. Naudin's observation<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>94</SUP></A> on Mirabilis, that it would be
    functionally effective. The fact of the ovules of <I>C. adami</I>
    being monstrous, and the pollen apparently sound, is all the more
    remarkable, because it is opposed to what usually occurs not only
    with most hybrids,<A href="#refer"><SUP>95</SUP></A> but with two
    hybrids in the same genus, namely in <I>C. purpureo-elongatus,</I>
    and <I>C. alpino-laburnum.</I> In both these hybrids, the ovules,
    as observed by Prof. Caspary and myself, were well-formed, whilst
    many of the pollen-grains were ill-formed; in the latter hybrid
    20.3 per cent, and in the former no less than 84&#183;8 per cent of
    the grains were ascertained by Prof. Caspary to be bad. This
    unusual condition of the male and female reproductive elements in
    <I>C. adami</I> has been used by Prof. Caspary as an argument
    against this plant being considered as an ordinary hybrid produced
    from seed; but we should remember that with hybrids the ovules have
    not been examined nearly so frequently as the pollen, and they may
    be much oftener imperfect than is generally supposed. Dr. E.
    Bornet, of Antibes, informs me (through Mr. J. Traherne Moggridge)
    that with hybrid Cisti the ovarium is frequently deformed, the
    ovules being in some cases quite absent, and in other cases
    incapable of fertilisation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Several theories have been propounded to
    account for the origin of <I>C. adami,</I> and for the
    transformations which it undergoes. The whole case has been
    attributed by some authors to bud-variation; but considering the
    wide difference between <I>C. laburnum</I> and <I>purpureus,</I>
    both of which are natural species, and considering the sterility of
    the intermediate form, this view may be summarily rejected. We
    shall presently see that, with hybrid plants, two embryos differing
    in their characters may be developed within the same seed and
    cohere; and it has been supposed that <I>C. adami</I> thus
    originated. Many botanists maintain that <I>C. adami</I> is a
    hybrid produced in the common way by seed, and that it has reverted
    by buds to its two parent-forms. Negative results are not of much
    value; but Reisseck, Caspary, and myself, tried in vain to cross
    <I>C. laburnum</I> and <I>purpureus</I>; when I fertilised the
    former with pollen of the latter, I had the nearest approach to
    success, for pods were formed, but in sixteen days after the
    withering of the flowers, they fell off. Nevertheless, the belief
    that <I>C. adami</I> is a spontaneously produced hybrid between
    these two species is supported by the fact that such hybrids have
    arisen in this genus. In a bed of seedlings from <I>C.
    elongatus,</I> which grew near to <I>C. purpureus,</I> and was
    probably fertilised by it through the agency of insects (for these,
    as I know by experiment, play an important part in the
    fertilisation of the laburnum), the sterile hybrid <I>C.
    purpureo-elongatus</I> appeared.<A href="#refer"><SUP>96</SUP></A>
    Thus, also, Waterer's laburnum, the <I>C. alpino-laburnum,</I><A
    href="#refer"><SUP>97</SUP></A> spontaneously appeared, as I am
    informed by Mr. Waterer, in a bed of seedlings.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>On the other hand, we have a clear and
    distinct account given to Poiteau,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>98</SUP></A> by M. Adam, who raised the plant,
    showing that <I>C. adami</I> is not an ordinary hybrid; but is what
    may be called a graft-hybrid, that is, one produced from the united
    cellular tissue of two distinct species. M. Adam inserted in the
    usual manner a shield of the bark of <I>C. purpureus</I> into a
    stock of <I>C. laburnum</I>; and the bud lay dormant, as often
    happens, for a year; the shield then produced many buds and shoots,
    one of which grew more upright and vigorous with larger leaves than
    the shoots of <I>C. purpureus,</I> and was consequently propagated.
    Now it deserves especial notice that these plants were sold by M.
    Adam, as a variety of <I>C. purpureus,</I> before they had
    flowered; and the account was published by Poiteau after the plants
    had flowered, but before they had exhibited their remarkable
    tendency to revert into the two parent species. So that there was
    no conceivable motive for falsification, and it is difficult to see
    how there could have been any error.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>99</SUP></A> If we admit as true M. Adam's account,
    we must admit the extraordinary fact that two distinct species can
    unite by their cellular tissue, and subsequently produce a plant
    bearing leaves and sterile flowers intermediate in character
    between the scion and stock, and producing buds liable to
    reversion; in short, resembling in every important respect a hybrid
    formed in the ordinary way by seminal reproduction.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will therefore give all the facts which I have
    been able to collect on the formation of hybrids between distinct
    species or varieties, without the intervention of the sexual
    organs. For if, as I am now convinced, this is possible, it is a
    most important fact, which will sooner or later change the views
    held by physiologists with respect to sexual reproduction. A
    sufficient body of facts will afterwards be adduced, showing that
    the segregation or separation of the characters of the two
    parent-forms by bud-variation, as in the case of <I>Cytisus
    adami,</I> is not an unusual though a striking phenomenon. We shall
    further see that a whole bud may thus revert, or only half, or some
    smaller segment.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The famous <I>bizzarria Orange</I> offers
    a strictly parallel case to that of <I>Cytisus adami.</I> The
    gardener who in 1644 in Florence raised this tree, declared that it
    was a seedling which had been grafted; and after the graft had
    perished, the stock sprouted and produced the bizzarria. Gallesio,
    who carefully examined several living specimens and compared them
    with the description given by the original describer, P. Nato,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>100</SUP></A> states that the tree produces at
    the same time leaves, flowers, and fruit identical with the bitter
    orange and with the citron of Florence, and likewise compound
    fruit, with the two kinds either blended together, both externally
    and internally, or segregated in various ways. This tree can be
    propagated by cuttings, and retains its diversified character. The
    so-called trifacial orange of Alexandria and Smyrna<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>101</SUP></A> resembles in its general nature the
    bizzarria, and differs only in the orange being of the sweet kind;
    this and the citron are blended together in the same fruit, or are
    separately produced on the same tree; nothing is known of its
    origin. In regard to the bizzarria, many authors believe that it is
    a graft-hybrid; Gallesio, on the other hand, thinks that it is an
    ordinary hybrid, with the habit of partially reverting by buds to
    the two parent-forms; and we have seen that the species in this
    genus often cross spontaneously.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is notorious that when the variegated
    Jessamine is budded on the common kind, the stock sometimes
    produces buds bearing variegated leaves: Mr. Rivers, as he informs
    me, has seen instances of this. The same thing occurs with the
    Oleander.<A href="#refer"><SUP>102</SUP></A> Mr. Rivers, on the
    authority of a trustworthy friend, states that some buds of a
    golden-variegated ash, which were inserted into common ashes, all
    died except one; but the ash-stocks were affected,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>103</SUP></A> and produced, both above and below the
    points of insertion of the plates of bark bearing the dead buds,
    shoots which bore variegated leaves. Mr. J. Anderson Henry has
    communicated to me a nearly similar case: Mr. Brown, of Perth,
    observed many years ago, in a Highland glen, an ash-tree with
    yellow leaves; and buds taken from this tree were inserted into
    common ashes, which in consequence were affected, and produced the
    <I>Blotched Breadalbane Ash.</I> This variety has been propagated,
    and has preserved its character during the last fifty years.
    Weeping ashes, also, were budded on the affected stocks, and became
    similarly variegated. It has been repeatedly proved that several
    species of Abutilon, on which the variegated <I>A. thompsonii</I>
    has been grafted, become variegated.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>104</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Many authors consider variegation as the
    result of disease; and the foregoing cases may be looked at as the
    direct result of the inoculation of a disease or some weakness.
    This has been almost proved to be the case by Morren in the
    excellent paper just referred to, who shows that even a leaf
    inserted by its footstalk into the bark of the stock is sufficient
    to communicate variegation to it, though the leaf soon perishes.
    Even fully formed leaves on the stock of Abutilon are sometimes
    affected by the graft and become variegated. Variegation is much
    influenced, as we shall hereafter see, by the nature of the soil in
    which the plants are grown; and it does not seem improbable that
    whatever change in the sap or tissues certain soils induce, whether
    or not called a disease, might spread from the inserted piece of
    bark to the stock. But a change of this kind cannot be considered
    to be of the nature of a graft-hybrid.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>There is a variety of the hazel with
    dark-purple leaves, like those of the copper-beech: no one has
    attributed this colour to disease, and it apparently is only an
    exaggeration of a tint which may often be seen on the leaves of the
    common hazel. When this variety is grafted on the common hazel,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>105</SUP></A> it sometimes colours, as has been
    asserted, the leaves below the graft; although negative evidence is
    not of much value, I may add that Mr. Rivers, who has possessed
    hundreds of such grafted trees, has never seen an
    instance.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>G&#228;rtner<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>106</SUP></A> quotes two separate accounts of
    branches of dark and white-fruited vines which had been united in
    various ways, such as being split longitudinally, and then joined,
    etc.; and these branches produced distinct bunches of grapes of the
    two colours, and other bunches with berries, either striped, or of
    an intermediate and new tint. Even the leaves in one case were
    variegated. These facts are the more remarkable because Andrew
    Knight never succeeded in raising variegated grapes by fertilising
    white kinds by pollen of dark kinds; though, as we have seen, he
    obtained seedlings with variegated fruits and leaves, by
    fertilising a white variety by the already variegated dark Aleppo
    grape. G&#228;rtner attributes the above-quoted cases merely to
    bud-variation; but it is a strange coincidence that the branches
    which had been grafted in a peculiar manner should alone thus have
    varied; and H. Adorne de Tscharner positively asserts that he
    produced the described result more than once, and could do so at
    will, by splitting and uniting the branches in the manner described
    by him.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I should not have quoted the following
    case had not the author of 'Des Jacinthes'<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>107</SUP></A> impressed me with the belief not only
    of his extensive knowledge, but of his truthfulness: he says that
    bulbs of blue and red hyacinths may be cut in two, and that they
    will grow together and throw up a united stem (and this I have
    myself seen) with flowers of the two colours on the opposite sides.
    But the remarkable point is, that flowers are sometimes produced
    with the two colours blended together, which makes the case closely
    analogous with that of the blended colours of the grapes on the
    united vine branches.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the case of roses it is supposed that
    several graft-hybrids have been formed, but there is much doubt
    about these cases, owing to the frequency of ordinary
    bud-variations. The most trustworthy instance known to me is one,
    recorded by Mr. Poynter,<A href="#refer"><SUP>108</SUP></A> who
    assures me in a letter of the entire accuracy of the statement. <I>
    Rosa devoniensis</I> had been budded some years previously on a
    white Banksian rose; and from the much enlarged point of junction,
    whence the Devoniensis and Banksian still continued to grow, a
    third branch issued, which was neither pure Banksian nor pure
    Devoniensis, but partook of the character of both; the flowers
    resembled, but were superior in character to those of the variety
    called <I>Lamarque</I> (one of the Noisettes), while the shoots
    were similar in their manner of growth to those of the Banksian
    rose, with the exception that the longer and more robust shoots
    were furnished with prickles. This rose was exhibited before the
    Floral Committee of the Horticultural Society of London. Dr.
    Lindley examined it and concluded that it had certainly been
    produced by the mingling of <I>R. banksi&#230;</I> with some rose
    like <I>R. devoniensis,</I> "for while it was very greatly
    increased in vigour and in size of all the parts, the leaves were
    half-way between a Banksian and Tea-scented rose." It appears that
    rose-growers were previously aware that the Banksian rose sometimes
    affects other roses. As Mr. Poynter's new variety is intermediate
    in its fruit and foliage between the stock and scion, and as it
    arose from the point of junction between the two, it is very
    improbable that it owes its origin to mere bud-variation,
    independently of the mutual influence of the stock and
    scion.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Lastly, with respect to potatoes. Mr. R.
    Trail stated in 1867 before the Botanical Society of Edinburgh (and
    has since given me fuller information), that several years ago he
    cut about sixty blue and white potatoes into halves through the
    eyes or buds, and then carefully joined them, destroying at the
    same time the other eyes. Some of these united tubers produced
    white, and others blue tubers; some, however, produced tubers
    partly white and partly blue; and the tubers from about four or
    five were regularly mottled with the two colours. In these latter
    cases we may conclude that a stem had been formed by the union of
    the bisected buds, that is, by graft-hybridisation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the 'Botanische Zeitung' (May 16,
    1868), Professor Hildebrand gives an account with a coloured
    figure, of his experiments on two varieties which were found during
    the same season to be constant in character, namely, a somewhat
    elongated rough-skinned red potato and a rounded smooth white one.
    He inserted buds reciprocally into both kinds, destroying the other
    buds. He thus raised two plants, and each of these produced a tuber
    intermediate in character between the two parent-forms. That from
    the red bud grafted into the white tuber, was at one end red and
    rough, as the whole tuber ought to have been if not affected; in
    the middle it was smooth with red stripes, and at the other end
    smooth and altogether white like that of the stock.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Taylor, who had received several
    accounts of potatoes having been grafted by wedge-shaped pieces of
    one variety inserted into another, though sceptical on the subject,
    made twenty-four experiments which he described in detail before
    the Horticultural Society.<A href="#refer"><SUP>109</SUP></A> He
    thus raised many new varieties, some like the graft or like the
    stock; others having an intermediate character. Several persons
    witnessed the digging up of the tubers from these graft-hybrids;
    and one of them, Mr. Jameson, a large dealer in potatoes, writes
    thus, "They were such a mixed lot, as I have never before or since
    seen. They were of all colours and shapes, some very ugly and some
    very handsome." Another witness says "some were round, some kidney,
    pink-eyed kidney, piebald, and mottled red and purple, of all
    shapes and sizes." Some of these varieties have been found
    valuable, and have been extensively propagated. Mr. Jameson took
    away a large piebald potato which he cut into five sets and
    propagated; these yielded round, white, red, and piebald
    potatoes.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Fitzpatrick followed a different
    plan;<A href="#refer"><SUP>110</SUP></A> he grafted together not
    the tubers but the young stems of varieties producing black, white,
    and red potatoes. The tubers borne by three of these twin or united
    plants were coloured in an extraordinary manner; one was almost
    exactly half black and half white, so that some persons on seeing
    it thought that two potatoes had been divided and rejoined; other
    tubers were half red and half white, or curiously mottled with red
    and white, or with red and black, according to the colours of the
    graft and stock.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The testimony of Mr. Fenn is of much
    value, as he is "a well known potato-grower" who has raised many
    new varieties by crossing different kinds in the ordinary manner.
    He considers it "demonstrated" that new, intermediate varieties can
    be produced by grafting the tubers, though he doubts whether such
    will prove valuable.<A href="#refer"><SUP>111</SUP></A> He made
    many trials and laid the results, exhibiting specimens, before the
    Horticultural Society. Not only were the tubers affected, some
    being smooth and white at one end and rough and red at the other,
    but the stems and leaves were modified in their manner of growth,
    colour and precocity. Some of these graft-hybrids after being
    propagated for three years still showed in their haulms their new
    character, different from that of the kind from which the eyes had
    been taken. Mr. Fenn gave twelve of the tubers of the third
    generation to Mr. Alex. Dean, who grew them, and was thus converted
    into a believer in graft-hybridisation, having previously been a
    complete sceptic. For comparison he planted the pure parent-forms
    alongside the twelve tubers; and found that many of the plants from
    the latter<A href="#refer"><SUP>112</SUP></A> were intermediate
    between the two parent-forms in precocity, in the tallness,
    uprightness, jointing, and robustness of the stems, and in the size
    and colour of the leaves.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Another experimentalist, Mr. Rintoul,
    grafted no less than fifty-nine tubers, which differed in shape
    (some being kidneys) in smoothness and colour,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>113</SUP></A> and many of the plants thus raised
    "were intermediate in the tubers as well as in the haulms." He
    describes the more striking cases.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In 1871 I received a letter from Mr.
    Merrick, of Boston, U.S.A., who states that, "Mr. Fearing Burr, a
    very careful experimenter and author of a much valued book, 'The
    Garden Vegetables of America' has succeeded in producing distinctly
    mottled and most curious potatoes&#8212;evidently graft-hybrids, by
    inserting eyes from blue or red potatoes into the substance of
    white ones, after removing the eyes of the latter. I have seen the
    potatoes, and they are very curious."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We will now turn to the experiments made
    in Germany, since the publication of Prof. Hildebrand's paper. Herr
    Magnus relates<A href="#refer"><SUP>114</SUP></A> the results of
    numerous trials made by Herren Reuter and Lindemuth, both attached
    to the Royal Gardens of Berlin. They inserted the eyes of red
    potatoes into white ones, and <I>vice versa.</I> Many different
    forms partaking of the characters of the inserted bud and of the
    stock were thus obtained; for instance, some of the tubers were
    white with red eyes.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Herr Magnus also exhibited in the
    following year before the same Society (Nov. 19, 1872), the produce
    of grafts between black, white, and red potatoes, made by Dr.
    Neubert. These were made by uniting not the tubers but the young
    stems, as was done by Mr. Fitzpatrick. The result was remarkable,
    inasmuch as all the tubers thus produced were intermediate in
    character, though in a variable degree. Those between the black and
    the white or the red were the most striking in appearance. Some
    from between the white and red had one half of one colour and the
    other half of the other colour.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>At the next meeting of the society Herr
    Magnus communicated the results of Dr. Heimann's experiments in
    grafting together the tubers of red Saxon, blue, and elongated
    white potatoes. The eyes were removed by a cylindrical instrument,
    and inserted into corresponding holes in other varieties. The
    plants thus produced yielded a great number of tubers, which were
    intermediate between the two parent-forms in shape, and in the
    colour both of the flesh and skin.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Herr Reuter experimented,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>115</SUP></A> by inserting wedges of the elongated
    White Mexican potato into a Black Kidney potato. Both sorts are
    known to be very constant, and differ much not only in form and
    colour, but in the eyes of the Black Kidney being deeply sunk,
    whereas those of the White Mexican are superficial and of a
    different shape. The tubers produced by these hybrids were
    intermediate in colour and form; and some which resembled in form
    the graft, <I>i.e.</I> the Mexican, had eyes deeply sunk and of the
    same shape as in the stock or Black Kidney.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Any one who will attentively consider the
    abstract now given, of the experiments made by many observers in
    several countries, will, I think, be convinced that by grafting two
    varieties of the potato together in various ways, hybridised plants
    can be produced. It should be observed that several of the
    experimentalists are scientific horticulturists, and some of them
    potato-growers on a large scale, who, though beforehand sceptical,
    have been fully convinced of the possibility, even of the ease, of
    making graft-hybrids. The only way of escaping from this conclusion
    is to attribute all the many recorded cases to simple
    bud-variation. Undoubtedly the potato, as we have seen in this
    chapter, does sometimes, though not often, vary by buds; but it
    should be especially noted that it is experienced potato-growers,
    whose business it is to look out for new varieties, who have
    expressed unbounded astonishment at the number of new forms
    produced by graft-hybridisation. It may be argued that it is merely
    the operation of grafting, and not the union of two kinds, which
    causes so extraordinary an amount of bud-variation; but this
    objection is at once answered by the fact that potatoes are
    habitually propagated by the tubers being cut into pieces, and the
    sole difference in the case of graft-hybrids is that either a half
    or a smaller segment or a cylinder is placed in close opposition
    with the tissue of another variety. Moreover, in two cases, the
    young stems were grafted together, and the plants thus united
    yielded the same results as when the tubers were united. It is an
    argument of the greatest weight that when varieties are produced by
    simple bud-variation, they frequently present quite new characters;
    whereas in all the numerous cases above given, as Herr Magnus
    likewise insists, the graft-hybrids are intermediate in character
    between the two forms employed. That such a result should follow if
    the one kind did not affect the other is incredible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Characters of all kinds are affected by graft
    hybridisation, in whatever way the grafting may have been effected.
    The plants thus raised yield tubers which partake of the widely
    different colours, form, state of surface, position and shape of
    the eye of the parents; and according to two careful observers they
    are also intermediate in certain constitutional peculiarities. But
    we should bear in mind that in all the varieties of the potato, the
    tubers differ much more than any other part.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The potato affords the best evidence of the
    possibility of the formation of graft-hybrids, but we must not
    overlook the account given of the origin of the famous <I>Cytisus
    adami</I> by M. Adam, who had no conceivable motive for deception,
    and the exactly parallel account of the origin of the Bizzarria
    orange, namely by graft-hybridisation. Nor must the cases be
    undervalued in which different varieties or species of vines,
    hyacinths and roses, have been grafted together, and have yielded
    intermediate forms. It is evident that graft-hybrids can be made
    much more easily with some plants, as the potato, than with others,
    for instance our common fruit trees; for these latter have been
    grafted by the million during many centuries, and though the graft
    is often slightly affected, it is very doubtful whether this may
    not be accounted for, merely by a more or less free supply of
    nutriment. Nevertheless, the cases above given seem to me to prove
    that under certain unknown conditions graft-hybridisation can be
    effected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Herr Magnus asserts with much truth that
    graft-hybrids resemble in all respects seminal hybrids, including
    their great diversity of character. There is, however, a partial
    exception, inasmuch as the characters of the two parent forms are
    not often homogeneously blended together in graft-hybrids. They
    much more commonly appear in a segregated condition,&#8212;that is,
    in segments either at first, or subsequently through reversion. It
    would seem that the reproductive elements are not so completely
    blended by grafting as by sexual generation. But segregation of
    this kind occurs by no means rarely, as will be immediately shown,
    in seminal hybrids. Finally it must, I think, be admitted that we
    learn from the foregoing cases a highly important physiological
    fact, namely, that the elements that go to the production of a new
    being, are not necessarily formed by the male and female organs.
    They are present in the cellular tissue in such a state that they
    can unite without the aid of the sexual organs, and thus give rise
    to a new bud partaking of the characters of the two
    parent-forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the segregation of the parental characters
    in seminal hybrids by bud-variation.</I>&#8212;I will now give a
    sufficient number of cases to show that segregation of this kind,
    namely, by buds, may occur in ordinary hybrids raised from
    seed.</P>

    of larger size, like the capsule of the pure <I>D. stramonium</I>:

    both parent-forms were raised.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Turning now to varieties. A <I>
    seedling</I> apple, conjectured to be of crossed parentage, has
    been described in France,<A href="#refer"><SUP>120</SUP></A> which
    bears fruit with one half larger than the other, of a red colour,
    acid taste, and peculiar odour; the other side being
    greenish-yellow and very sweet: it is said scarcely ever to include
    perfectly developed seed. I suppose that this is not the same tree
    as that which Gaudichaud<A href="#refer"><SUP>121</SUP></A>
    exhibited before the French institute, bearing on the same branch
    two distinct kinds of apples, one a <I>reinette rouge,</I> and the
    other like a <I>reinette canada jaun&#226;tre</I>: this
    double-bearing variety can be propagated by grafts, and continues
    to produce both kinds; its origin is unknown. The Rev. J. D. La
    Touche sent me a coloured drawing of an apple which he brought from
    Canada, of which half, surrounding and including the whole of the
    calyx and the insertion of the foot-stalk, is green, the other half
    being brown and of the nature of the <I>pomme gris</I> apple, with
    the line of separation between the two halves exactly defined. The
    tree was a grafted one, and Mr. La Touche thinks that the branches
    which bore this curious apple sprung from the point of junction of
    the graft and stock: had this fact been ascertained, the case would
    probably have come into the class of graft-hybrids already given.
    But the branch may have sprung from the stock, which no doubt was a
    seedling.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Prof. H. Lecoq, who has made a great
    number of crossings between the differently coloured varieties of
    <I>Mirabilis jalapa,</I><A href="#refer"><SUP>122</SUP></A> finds
    that in the seedlings the colours rarely combine, but form distinct
    stripes; or half the flower is of one colour and half of a
    different colour. Some varieties regularly bear flowers striped
    with yellow, white, and red; but plants of such varieties
    occasionally produce on the same root branches with uniformly
    coloured flowers of all three tints, and other branches with
    half-and-half coloured flowers, and others with marbled flowers.
    Gallesio<A href="#refer"><SUP>123</SUP></A> crossed reciprocally
    white and red carnations, and the seedlings were striped; but some
    of the striped plants also bore entirely white and entirely red
    flowers. Some of these plants produced one year red flowers alone,
    and in the following year striped flowers; or conversely, some
    plants, after having borne for two or three years striped flowers,
    would revert and bear exclusively red flowers. It may be worth
    mentioning that I fertilised the <I>Purple Sweet-pea (Lathyrus
    odoratus)</I> with pollen from the light-coloured <I>Painted
    Lady</I>: seedlings raised from the same pod were not intermediate
    in character, but perfectly resembled either parent. Later in the
    summer, the plants which had at first borne flowers identical with
    those of the <I>Painted Lady,</I> produced flowers streaked and
    blotched with purple; showing in these darker marks a tendency to
    reversion to the mother-variety. Andrew Knight<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>124</SUP></A> fertilised two white grapes with pollen
    of the Aleppo grape, which is darkly variegated both in its leaves
    and fruit. The result was that the young seedlings were not at
    first variegated, but all became variegated during the succeeding
    summer; besides this, many produced on the same plant bunches of
    grapes which were all black, or all white, or lead-coloured striped
    with white, or white dotted with minute black stripes; and grapes
    of all these shades could frequently be found on the same
    foot-stalk.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will append a very curious case, not of
    bud-variation, but of two cohering embryos, different in character
    and contained within the same seed. A distinguished botanist, Mr.
    G. H. Thwaites,<A href="#refer"><SUP>125</SUP></A> states that a
    seed from <I>Fuchsia coccinea</I> fertilised by <I>F. fulgens,</I>
    contained two embryos, and was "a true vegetable twin." The two
    plants produced from the two embryos were "extremely different in
    appearance and character," though both resembled other hybrids of
    the same parentage produced at the same time. These twin plants
    "were closely coherent, below the two pairs of cotyledon-leaves,
    into a single cylindrical stem, so that they had subsequently the
    appearance of being branches on one trunk." Had the two united
    stems grown up to their full height, instead of dying, a curiously
    mixed hybrid would have been produced. A mongrel melon described by
    Sageret<A href="#refer"><SUP>126</SUP></A> may perhaps have thus
    originated; for the two main branches, which arose from two
    cotyledon-buds, produced very different fruit,&#8212;on the one
    branch like that of the paternal variety, and on the other branch
    like to a certain extent that of the maternal variety, the melon of
    China.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In most of these cases of crossed varieties, and
    in some of the cases of crossed species, the colours proper to both
    parents appeared in the seedlings, as soon as they first flowered,
    in the form of stripes or larger segments, or as whole flowers or
    fruit of different kinds borne on the same plant; and in this case
    the appearance of the two colours cannot strictly be said to be due
    to reversion, but to some incapacity of fusion. When, however, the
    later flowers or fruit produced during the same season, or during a
    succeeding year or generation, become striped or half-and-half,
    etc., the segregation of the two colours is strictly a case of
    reversion by bud-variation. Whether all the many recorded cases of
    striped flowers and fruit are due to previous hybridisation and
    reversion is by no means clear, for instance with peaches and
    nectarines, moss-roses, etc. In a future chapter I shall show that,
    with animals of crossed parentage, the same individual has been
    known to change its character during growth, and to revert to one
    of its parents which it did not at first resemble. Finally, from
    the various facts now given, there can be no doubt that the same
    individual plant, whether a hybrid or a mongrel, sometimes returns
    in its leaves, flowers, and fruit, either wholly or by segments, to
    both parent-forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the direct or immediate action of the male
    element on the mother form.</I>&#8212;Another remarkable class of
    facts must be here considered, firstly, because they have a high
    physiological importance, and secondly, because they have been
    supposed to account for some cases of bud-variation. I refer to the
    direct action of the male element, not in the ordinary way on the
    ovules, but on certain parts of the female plant, or in case of
    animals on the subsequent progeny of the female by a second male. I
    may premise that with plants the ovarium and the coats of the
    ovules are obviously parts of the female, and it could not have
    been anticipated that they would have been affected by the pollen
    of a foreign variety or species, although the development of the
    embryo, inside the embryonic sack, inside the ovule and ovarium, of
    course, depends on the male element.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Even as long ago as 1729 it was
    observed<A href="#refer"><SUP>127</SUP></A> that white and blue
    varieties of the Pea, when planted near each other, mutually
    crossed, no doubt through the agency of bees, and in the autumn
    blue and white peas were found within the same pods. Wiegmann made
    an exactly similar observation in the present century. The same
    result has followed several times when a variety with peas of one
    colour has been artificially crossed by a differently-coloured
    variety.<A href="#refer"><SUP>128</SUP></A> These statements led
    G&#228;rtner, who was highly sceptical on the subject, carefully to
    try a long series of experiments: he selected the most constant
    varieties, and the result conclusively showed that the colour of
    the skin of the pea is modified when pollen of a differently
    coloured variety is used. This conclusion has since been confirmed
    by experiments made by the Rev. J. M. Berkeley.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>129</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Laxton of Stamford, whilst making
    experiments on peas for the express purpose of ascertaining the
    influence of foreign pollen on the mother-plant, has recently<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>130</SUP></A> observed an important additional
    fact. He fertilised the Tall Sugar-pea, which bears very thin green
    pods, becoming brownish-white when dry, with pollen of the
    Purple-podded pea, which, as its name expresses, has dark-purple
    pods with very thick skin, becoming pale reddish purple when dry.
    Mr. Laxton has cultivated the tall sugar-pea during twenty years,
    and has never seen or heard of it producing a purple pod:
    nevertheless, a flower fertilised by pollen from the purple-pod
    yielded a pod clouded with purplish-red which Mr. Laxton kindly
    gave to me. A space of about two inches in length towards the
    extremity of the pod, and a smaller space near the stalk, were thus
    coloured. On comparing the colour with that of the purple pod, both
    pods having been first dried and then soaked in water, it was found
    to be identically the same; and in both the colour was confined to
    the cells lying immediately beneath the outer skin of the pod. The
    valves of the crossed pod were also decidedly thicker and stronger
    than those of the pods of the mother-plant, but this may possibly
    have been an accidental circumstance, for I know not how far their
    thickness is a variable character in the Tall
    Sugar-pea.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The peas of the Tall Sugar-pea, when dry,
    are pale greenish-brown, thickly covered with dots of dark purple
    so minute as to be visible only through a lens, and Mr. Laxton has
    never seen or heard of this variety producing a purple pea; but in
    the crossed pod one of the peas was of a uniform beautiful
    violet-purple tint, and a second was irregularly clouded with pale
    purple. The colour lies in the outer of the two coats which
    surround the pea. As the peas of the purple-podded variety when dry
    are of a pale greenish-buff, it would at first appear that this
    remarkable change of colour in the peas in the crossed pod could
    not have been caused by the direct action of the pollen of the
    purple-pod: but when we bear in mind that this latter variety has
    purple flowers, purple marks on its stipules, and purple pods; and
    that the Tall Sugar-pea likewise has purple flowers and stipules,
    and microscopically minute purple dots on the peas, we can hardly
    doubt that the tendency to the production of purple in both parents
    has in combination modified the colour of the peas in the crossed
    pod. After having examined these specimens, I crossed the same two
    varieties, and the peas in one pod but not the pods themselves,
    were clouded and tinted with purplish-red in a much more
    conspicuous manner than the peas in the uncrossed pods produced at
    the same time by the same plants. I may notice as a caution that
    Mr. Laxton sent me various other crossed peas slightly, or even
    greatly, modified in colour; but the change in these cases was due,
    as had been suspected by Mr. Laxton, to the altered colour of the
    cotyledons, seen through the transparent coats of the peas; and as
    the cotyledons are parts of the embryo, these cases are not in any
    way remarkable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Turning now to the genus Matthiola. The
    pollen of one kind of stock sometimes affects the colour of the
    seeds of another kind, used as the mother-plant. I give the
    following case the more readily, as G&#228;rtner doubted similar
    statements previously made with respect to the stock by other
    observers. A well-known horticulturist, Major Trevor Clarke,
    informs me<A href="#refer"><SUP>131</SUP></A> that the seeds of the
    large red-flowered <I>biennial</I> stock, <I>Matthiola annua</I>
    (<I>Cocardeau</I> of the French), are light brown, and those of the
    purple branching Queen stock (<I>M. incana</I>) are violet-black;
    and he found that, when flowers of the red stock were fertilised by
    pollen from the purple stock, they yielded about fifty per cent of
    <I>black</I> seeds. He sent me four pods from a red flowered plant,
    two of which had been fertilised by their own pollen, and they
    included pale brown seed; and two which had been crossed by pollen
    from the purple kind, and they included seeds all deeply tinged
    with black. These latter seeds yielded purple-flowered plants like
    their father; whilst the pale brown seeds yielded normal
    red-flowered plants; and Major Clarke, by sowing similar seeds, has
    observed on a greater scale the same result. The evidence in this
    case of the direct action of the pollen of one species on the
    colour of the seeds of another species appears to me
    conclusive.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Gallesio<A href=

    characters of the lemon. Mr. Anderson<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>133</SUP></A> fertilised a green-fleshed melon with
    pollen from a scarlet-fleshed kind; in two of the fruits "a
    sensible change was perceptible: and four other fruits were
    somewhat altered both internally and externally." The seeds of the
    two first-mentioned fruits produced plants partaking of the good
    properties of both parents. In the United States, where
    Cucurbitace&#230; are largely cultivated, it is the popular
    belief<A href="#refer"><SUP>134</SUP></A> that the fruit is thus
    directly affected hy foreign pollen; and I have received a similar
    statement with respect to the cucumber in England. It is believed
    that grapes have been thus affected in colour, size, and shape: in
    France a pale-coloured grape had its juice tinted by the pollen of
    the dark-coloured Teinturier; in Germany a variety bore berries
    which were affected by the pollen of two adjoining kinds; some of
    the berries being only partially affected or mottled.<A href=

    belief in the United States. Dr. Savi<A href=

    sowed yellow and black-seeded maize together, and on the same ear
    some of the seeds were yellow, some black, and some mottled, the
    differently coloured seeds being arranged irregularly or in rows.
    Prof. Hildebrand has repeated the experiment<A href=

    that the mother-plant was true. A kind bearing yellow grains was
    fertilised with pollen of a kind having brown grains, and two ears
    produced yellow grains mingled with others of a dirty violet tint.
    A third ear had only yellow grains, but one side of the spindle was
    tinted of a reddish-brown; so that here we have the important fact
    of the influence of the foreign pollen extending to the axis. Mr.
    Arnold, in Canada, varied the experiment in an interesting manner:
    "a female flower was subjected first to the action of pollen from a
    yellow variety, and then to that from a white variety; the result
    was an ear, each grain of which was yellow below and white
    above."<A href="#refer"><SUP>139</SUP></A> With other plants it has

    dalhousi&#230;</I> with the pollen of <I>R. nuttallii,</I> which is
    one of the largest-flowered and noblest species of the genus. The
    largest pod produced by the former species, when fertilised with
    its own pollen, measured 1&#188; inch in length and 1&#189; in
    girth; whilst three of the pods which had been fertilised by pollen
    of <I>R. nuttallii</I> measured 1-5/8 inch in length and no less
    than 2 inches in girth. Here the effect of the foreign pollen was
    apparently confined to increasing the size of the ovarium; but we
    must be cautious in assuming, as the following case shows, that
    size had been transferred from the male parent to the capsule of
    the female plant. Mr. Henry fertilised <I>Arabis blepharophylla</I>
    with pollen of <I>A. soyeri,</I> and the pods thus produced, of
    which he was so kind as to send me detailed measurements and
    sketches, were much larger in all their dimensions than those
    naturally produced by either the male or female parent-species. In
    a future chapter we shall see that the organs of vegetation in
    hybrid plants, independently of the character of either parent, are
    sometimes developed to a monstrous size; and the increased size of
    the pods in the foregoing cases may be an analogous fact. On the
    other hand, M. de Saporta informs me that an isolated female plant
    of <I>Pistacia vera</I> is very apt to be fertilised by the pollen

    thus affected were recorded by Bradley in the early part of the
    last century; and other cases are given in old volumes of the
    'Philosophical Transactions';<A href="#refer"><SUP>145</SUP></A> in
    one of these a Russeting apple and an adjoining kind mutually
    affected each other's fruit; and in another case a smooth apple
    affected a rough-coated kind. Another instance has been given<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>146</SUP></A> of two very different apple-trees
    growing close to each other, which bore fruit resembling each
    other, but only on the adjoining branches. It is, however, almost
    superfluous to adduce these or other cases, after that of the St.
    Valery apple, the flowers which, from the abortion of the stamens,
    do not produce pollen, but are fertilised by the girls of the
    neighbourhood with pollen of many kinds; and they bear fruit,
    "differing from one another in size, flavour, and colour, but
    resembling in character the hermaphrodite kinds by which they have
    been fertilised."<A href="#refer"><SUP>147</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have now shown, on the authority of several
    excellent observers, in the case of plants belonging to widely
    different orders, that the pollen of one species or variety, when
    applied to the female of a distinct form, occasionally causes the
    coats of the seeds, the ovarium or fruit, including even the calyx
    and upper part of the peduncle of the apple, and the axis of the
    ear in maize, to be modified. Sometimes the whole ovarium or all
    the seeds are thus affected; sometimes only a certain number of the
    seeds, as in the case of the pea, or only a part of the ovarium, as
    with the striped orange, mottled grapes, and maize, is thus
    affected. It must not be supposed that any direct or immediate
    effect invariably follows the use of foreign pollen: this is far
    from being the case; nor is it known on what conditions the result
    depends. Mr. Knight<A href="#refer"><SUP>148</SUP></A> expressly
    states that he has never seen the fruit thus affected, though he
    crossed thousands of apple and other fruit-trees.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is not the least reason to believe that a
    branch which has borne seed or fruit directly modified by foreign
    pollen is itself affected, so as afterwards to produce modified
    buds; such an occurrence, from the temporary connection of the
    flower with the stem, would be hardly possible. Hence, but very
    few, if any, of the cases of bud-variation in the fruit of trees,
    given in the early part of this chapter can be accounted for by the
    action of foreign pollen; for such fruits have commonly been
    propagated by budding or grafting. It is also obvious that changes
    of colour in flowers, which necessarily supervene long before they
    are ready for fertilisation, and changes in the shape or colour of
    leaves, when due to the appearance of modified buds, can have no
    relation to the action of foreign pollen.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The proofs of the action of foreign pollen on
    the mother-plant have been given in considerable detail, because
    this action, as we shall see in a future chapter, is of the highest
    theoretical importance, and because it is in itself a remarkable
    and apparently anomalous circumstance. That it is remarkable under
    a physiological point of view is clear, for the male element not
    only affects, in accordance with its proper function, the germ, but
    at the same time various parts of the mother-plant, in the same
    manner, as it affects the same part in the seminal offspring from
    the same two parents. We thus learn that an ovule is not
    indispensable for the reception of the influence of the male
    element. But this direct action of the male element is not so
    anomalous as it at first appears, for it comes into play in the
    ordinary fertilisation of many flowers. G&#228;rtner gradually
    increased the number of pollen grains until he succeeded in
    fertilising a Malva, and has<A href="#refer"><SUP>149</SUP></A>
    proved that many grains are first expended in the development, or,
    as he expresses it, in the satiation, of the pistil and ovarium.
    Again, when one plant is fertilised by a widely distinct species,
    it often happens that the ovarium is fully and quickly developed
    without any seeds being formed; or the coats of the seeds are
    formed without any embryo being developed within. Prof. Hildebrand,
    also, has lately shown<A href="#refer"><SUP>150</SUP></A> that, in
    the normal fertilisation of several Orchide&#230;, the action of
    the plant's own pollen is necessary for the development of the
    ovarium; and that this development takes place not only long before
    the pollen-tubes have reached the ovules, but even before the
    placent&#230; and ovules have been formed; so that with these
    orchids the pollen acts directly on the ovarium. On the other hand,
    we must not overrate the efficacy of pollen in the case of
    hybridised plants, for an embryo may be formed and its influence
    excite the surrounding tissues of the mother-plant, and then perish
    at a very early age and be thus overlooked. Again, it is well known
    that with many plants the ovarium may be fully developed, though
    pollen be wholly excluded. Lastly, Mr. Smith, the late Curator at
    Kew (as I hear through Dr. Hooker), observed with an orchid, the
    <I>Bonatea speciosa,</I> the singular fact that the development of
    the ovarium could be effected by the mechanical irritation of the
    stigma. Nevertheless, from the number of the pollen-grains expended
    "in the satiation of the ovarium and pistil,"&#8212;from the
    generality of the formation of the ovarium and seed-coats in
    hybridised plants which produce no seeds,&#8212;and from Dr.
    Hildebrand's observations on orchids, we may admit that in most
    cases the swelling of the ovarium, and the formation of the
    seed-coats are at least aided, if not wholly caused, by the direct
    action of the pollen, independently of the intervention of the
    fertilised germ. Therefore, in the previously given cases we have
    only to believe in the further power of pollen, when applied to a
    distinct species or variety, to influence the shape, size, colour,
    texture, etc., of certain parts of the mother-plant.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Turning now to the animal kingdom. If we could
    imagine the same flower to yield seeds during successive years,
    then it would not be very surprising that a flower of which the
    ovarium had been modified by foreign pollen should next year
    produce, when self-fertilised, offspring modified by the previous
    male influence. Closely analogous cases have actually occurred with
    animals. In the case often quoted from Lord Morton,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>151</SUP></A> a nearly purely-bred Arabian chestnut
    mare bore a hybrid to a quagga; she was subsequently sent to Sir
    Gore Ouseley, and produced two colts by a black Arabian horse.
    These colts were partially dun-coloured, and were striped on the
    legs more plainly than the real hybrid, or even than the quagga.
    One of the two colts had its neck and some other parts of its body
    plainly marked with stripes. Stripes on the body, not to mention
    those on the legs, are extremely rare,&#8212;I speak after having
    long attended to the subject,&#8212;with horses of all kinds in
    Europe, and are almost unknown in the case of Arabians. But what
    makes the case still more striking is that in these colts the hair
    of the mane resembled that of the quagga, being short, stiff, and
    upright. Hence there can be no doubt that the quagga affected the
    character of the offspring subsequently begot by the black Arabian
    horse. Mr. Jenner Weir informs me of a strictly parallel case: his
    neighbour Mr. Lethbridge, of Blackheath, has a horse, bred by Lord
    Mostyn, which had previously borne a foal by a quagga. This horse
    is dun with a dark stripe down the back, faint stripes on the
    forehead between the eyes, plain stripes on the inner side of the
    fore-legs and rather more faint ones on the hind-legs, with no
    shoulder-stripe. The mane grows much lower on the forehead than in
    the horse, but not so low as in the quagga or zebra. The hoofs are
    proportionally longer than in the horse,&#8212;so much so that the
    farrier who first shod this animal, and knew nothing of its origin,
    said, "Had I not seen I was shoeing a horse, I should have thought
    I was shoeing a donkey."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the varieties of our
    domesticated animals, many similar and well-authenticated facts
    have been published,<A href="#refer"><SUP>152</SUP></A> and others
    have been communicated to me, plainly showing the influence of the
    first male on the progeny subsequently borne by the mother to other
    males. It will suffice to give a single instance, recorded in the
    'Philosophical Transactions,' in a paper following that by Lord
    Morton: Mr. Giles put a sow of Lord Western's black and white Essex
    breed to a wild boar of a deep chestnut colour; and the "pigs
    produced partook in appearance of both boar and sow, but in some
    the chestnut colour of the boar strongly prevailed." After the boar
    had long been dead, the sow was put to a boar of her own black and
    white breed&#8212;a kind which is well known to breed very true and
    never to show any chestnut colour,&#8212;yet from this union the
    sow produced some young pigs which were plainly marked with the
    same chestnut tint as in the first litter. Similar cases have so
    frequently occurred, that careful breeders avoid putting a choice
    female of any animal to an inferior male, on account of the injury
    to her subsequent progeny which may be expected to follow.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some physiologists have attempted to account for
    these remarkable results from a previous impregnation, by the
    imagination of the mother having been strongly affected; but it
    will hereafter be seen that there are very slight grounds for any
    such belief. Other physiologists attribute the result to the close
    attachment and freely intercommunicating blood-vessels between the
    modified embryo and mother. But the analogy from the action of
    foreign pollen on the ovarium, seed-coats, and other parts of the
    mother-plant, strongly supports the belief that with animals the
    male element acts directly on the female, and not through the
    crossed embryo. With birds there is no close connection between the
    embryo and mother; yet a careful observer, Dr. Chapuis, states<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>153</SUP></A> that with pigeons the influence of
    a first male sometimes makes itself perceived in the succeeding
    broods; but this statement requires confirmation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Conclusion and Summary of the
    Chapter.</I>&#8212;The facts given in the latter half of this
    chapter are well worthy of consideration, as they show us in how
    many extraordinary modes the union of one form with another may
    lead to the modification of the seminal offspring or of the buds,
    afterwards produced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is nothing surprising in the offspring of
    species or varieties crossed in the ordinary manner being modified;
    but the case of two plants within the same seed, which cohere and
    differ from each other, is curious. When a bud is formed after the
    cellular tissue of two species or two varieties have been united,
    and it partakes of the characters of both parents, the case is
    wonderful. But I need not here repeat what has been so lately said
    on this subject. We have also seen that in the case of plants the
    male element may affect in a direct manner the tissues of the
    mother, and with animals may lead to the modification of her future
    progeny. In the vegetable kingdom the offspring from a cross
    between two species or varieties, whether effected by seminal
    generation or by grafting, often revert, to a greater or less
    degree, in the first or in a succeeding generation, to the two
    parent-forms; and this reversion may affect the whole flower,
    fruit, or leaf-bud, or only the half or a smaller segment of a
    single organ. In some cases, however, such segregation of character
    apparently depends on an incapacity for union rather than on
    reversion, for the flowers or fruit which are first produced
    display by segments the characters of both parents. The various
    facts here given ought to be well considered by any one who wishes
    to embrace under a single point of view the many modes of
    reproduction by gemmation, division, and sexual union, the
    reparation of lost parts, variation, inheritance, reversion, and
    other such phenomena. Towards the close of the second volume I
    shall attempt to connect these facts together by the hypothesis of
    pangenesis.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the early half of the present chapter I have
    given a long list of plants in which through bud-variation, that
    is, independently of reproduction by seed, the fruit has suddenly
    become modified in size, colour, flavour, hairiness, shape, and
    time of maturity; flowers have similarly changed in shape, colour,
    in being double, and greatly in the character of the calyx; young
    branches or shoots have changed in colour, in bearing spines and in
    habit of growth, as in climbing or in weeping; leaves have changed
    in becoming variegated, in shape, period of unfolding, and in their
    arrangement on the axis. Buds of all kinds, whether produced on
    ordinary branches or on subterranean stems, whether simple or much
    modified and supplied with a stock of nutriment, as in tubers and
    bulbs, are all liable to sudden variations of the same general
    nature.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the list, many of the cases are certainly due
    to reversion to characters not acquired from a cross, but which
    were formerly present and have since been lost for a longer or
    shorter time;&#8212;as when a bud on a variegated plant produces
    plain leaves, or when the variously-coloured flowers of the
    Chrysanthemum revert to the aboriginal yellow tint. Many other
    cases included in the list are probably due to the plants being of
    crossed parentage, and to the buds reverting either completely or
    by segments to one of the two parent-forms.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>154</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We may suspect that the strong tendency in the
    Chrysanthemum to produce by bud-variation differently-coloured
    flowers, results from the varieties having been at some time
    intentionally or accidentally crossed; and this is certainly the
    case with some kinds of Pelargonium. So it may be to a large extent
    with the bud-varieties of the Dahlia, and with the "broken colours
    "of Tulips. When, however, a plant reverts by bud-variation to its
    two parent forms, or to one of them, it sometimes does not revert
    perfectly, but assumes a somewhat new character,&#8212;of which
    fact, instances have been given, and Carri&#232;re gives<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>155</SUP></A> another in the cherry.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Many cases of bud-variation, however, cannot be
    attributed to reversion, but to so-called spontaneous variability,
    as is so common with cultivated plants raised from seed. As a
    single variety of the Chrysanthemum has produced by buds six other
    varieties, and as one variety of the gooseberry has borne at the
    same time four distinct kinds of fruit, it is scarcely possible to
    believe that all these variations are due to reversion. We can
    hardly believe, as remarked in a previous chapter, that all the
    many peaches which have yielded nectarine-buds are of crossed
    parentage. Lastly, in such cases as that of the moss-rose, with its
    peculiar calyx, and of the rose which bears opposite leaves, in
    that of the Imatophyllum, etc., there is no known natural species
    or variety from which the characters in question could have been
    derived by a cross. We must attribute all such cases to the
    appearance of absolutely new characters in the buds. The varieties
    which have thus arisen cannot be distinguished by any external
    character from seedlings; this is notoriously the case with the
    varieties of the Rose, Azalea, and many other plants. It deserves
    notice that all the plants which have yielded bud-variations have
    likewise varied greatly by seed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The plants which have varied by buds belong to
    so many orders that we may infer that almost every plant would be
    liable to variation, if placed under the proper exciting
    conditions. These conditions, as far as we can judge, mainly depend
    on long-continued and high cultivation; for almost all the plants
    in the foregoing list are perennials, and have been largely
    propagated in many soils, under different climates, by cuttings,
    offsets, bulbs, tubers, and especially by budding or grafting. The
    instances of annuals varying by buds, or producing on the same
    plant differently coloured flowers, are comparatively rare:
    Hopkirk<A href="#refer"><SUP>156</SUP></A> has seen this with <I>
    Convolvulus tricolor</I>; and it is not uncommon with the Balsam
    and annual Delphinium. According to Sir R. Schomburgk, plants from
    the warmer temperate regions, when cultivated under the hot climate
    of St. Domingo, are eminently liable to bud-variation. I am
    informed by Mr. Sedgwick that moss-roses which have often been
    taken to Calcutta always there lose their mossiness; but change of
    climate is by no means a necessary contingent, as we see with the
    gooseberry, currant, and in many other cases. Plants living under
    their natural conditions are very rarely subject to bud-variation.
    Variegated leaves have, however, been observed under such
    circumstances; and I have given an instance of variation by buds on
    an ash-tree planted in ornamental grounds, but it is doubtful
    whether such a tree can be considered as living under strictly
    natural conditions. G&#228;rtner has seen white and dark-red
    flowers produced from the same root of the wild <I>Achillea
    millefolium</I>; and Prof. Caspary has seen a completely wild <I>
    Viola lutea</I> bearing flowers of two different colours and
    sizes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>157</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As wild plants are so rarely liable to
    bud-variation, whilst highly cultivated plants long propagated by
    artificial means have yielded many varieties by this form of
    reproduction, we are led through a series such as the
    following,&#8212;namely, all the eyes in the same tuber of the
    potato varying in the same manner,&#8212;all the fruit on a purple
    plum-tree suddenly becoming yellow,&#8212;all the fruit on a
    double-flowered almond suddenly becoming peach like,&#8212;all the
    buds on grafted trees being in a very slight degree affected by the
    stock on which they have been worked,&#8212;all the flowers on a
    transplanted heartsease changing for a time in colour, size, and
    shape,&#8212;we are led by such a series to look at every case of
    bud-variation as the direct result of the conditions of life to
    which the plant has been exposed. On the other hand, plants of the
    same variety may be cultivated in two adjoining beds, apparently
    under exactly the same conditions, and those in the one bed, as
    Carri&#232;re insists,<A href="#refer"><SUP>158</SUP></A> will
    produce many bud-variations, and those in the other not a single
    one. Again, if we look to such cases as that of a peach-tree which,
    after having been cultivated by tens of thousands during many years
    in many countries, and after having annually produced millions of
    buds, all of which have apparently been exposed to precisely the
    same conditions, yet at last suddenly produces a single bud with
    its whole character greatly transformed, we are driven to the
    conclusion that the transformation stands in no <I>direct</I>
    relation to the conditions of life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that varieties produced from seeds
    and from buds resemble each other so closely in general appearance
    that they cannot be distinguished. Just as certain species and
    groups of species, when propagated by seed, are more variable than
    other species or genera, so it is in the case of certain
    bud-varieties. Thus, the Queen of England Chrysanthemum has
    produced by this latter process no less than six, and Rollisson's
    Unique Pelargonium four distinct varieties; moss-roses have also
    produced several other moss-roses. The Rosace&#230; have varied by
    buds more than any other group of plants; but this may be in large
    part due to so many members having been long cultivated; but within
    this same group, the peach has often varied by buds, whilst the
    apple and pear, both grafted trees extensively cultivated, have
    afforded, as far as I can ascertain, extremely few instances of
    bud-variation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The law of analogous variation holds good with
    varieties produced by buds, as with those produced from seed: more
    than one kind of rose has sported into a moss-rose; more than one
    kind of camellia has assumed an hexagonal form; and at least seven
    or eight varieties of the peach have produced nectarines.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The laws of inheritance seem to be nearly the
    same with seminal and bud-varieties. We know how commonly reversion
    comes into play with both, and it may affect the whole, or only
    segments of a leaf, flower, or fruit. When the tendency to
    reversion affects many buds on the same tree, it becomes covered
    with different kinds of leaves, flowers, or fruit; but there is
    reason to believe that such fluctuating varieties have generally
    arisen from seed. It is well known that, out of a number of
    seedling varieties, some transmit their character much more truly
    by seed than others; so with bud-varieties, some retain their
    character by successive buds more truly than others; of which
    instances have been given with two kinds of variegated Euonymus and
    with certain kinds of tulips and pelargoniums. Notwithstanding the
    sudden production of bud-varieties, the characters thus acquired
    are sometimes capable of transmission by seminal reproduction: Mr.
    Rivers has found that moss-roses generally reproduce themselves by
    seed; and the mossy character has been transferred by crossing from
    one species of rose to another. The Boston nectarine, which
    appeared as a bud-variation, produced by seed a closely allied
    nectarine. On the other hand, seedlings from some bud-variations
    have proved variable to an extreme degree.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>159</SUP></A> We have also heard, on the authority of
    Mr. Salter, that seeds taken from a branch with leaves variegated
    through bud-variation, transmit this character very feebly; whilst
    many plants, which were variegated as seedlings, transmit
    variegation to a large proportion of their progeny.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although I have been able to collect a good many
    cases of bud-variation, as shown in the previous lists, and might
    probably, by searching foreign horticultural works, have collected
    very many more cases, yet their total number is as nothing in
    comparison with that of seminal varieties. With seedlings raised
    from the more variable cultivated plants, the variations are almost
    infinitely numerous, but their differences are generally slight:
    only at long intervals of time a strongly marked modification
    appears. On the other hand, it is a singular and inexplicable fact
    that, when plants vary by buds, the variations, though they occur
    with comparative rarity, are often, or even generally, strongly
    pronounced. It struck me that this might perhaps be a delusion, and
    that slight changes often occurred in buds, but were overlooked or
    not recorded from being of no value. Accordingly, I applied to two
    great authorities on this subject, namely, to Mr. Rivers with
    respect to fruit-trees, and to Mr. Salter with respect to flowers.
    Mr. Rivers is doubtful, but does not remember having noticed very
    slight variations in fruit-buds. Mr. Salter informs me that with
    flowers such do occur, but, if propagated, they generally lose
    their new character in the following year; yet he concurs with me
    that bud-variations usually at once assume a decided and permanent
    character. We can hardly doubt that this is the rule, when we
    reflect on such cases as that of the peach, which has been so
    carefully observed, and of which such trifling seminal varieties
    have been propagated, yet this tree has repeatedly produced by
    bud-variation nectarines, and only twice (as far as I can learn)
    any other variety, namely, the Early and Late Grosse Mignonne
    peaches; and these differ from the parent-tree in hardly any
    character except the period of maturity.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To my surprise, I hear from Mr. Salter that he
    brings the principle of selection to bear on variegated plants
    propagated by buds, and has thus greatly improved and fixed several
    varieties. He informs me that at first a branch often produces
    variegated leaves on one side alone, and that the leaves are marked
    only with an irregular edging or with a few lines of white and
    yellow. To improve and fix such varieties, he finds it necessary to
    encourage the buds at the bases of the most distinctly marked
    leaves, and to propagate from them alone. By following with
    perseverance this plan during three or four successive seasons, a
    distinct and fixed variety can generally be secured.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, the facts given in this chapter prove
    in how close and remarkable a manner the germ of a fertilised seed
    and the small cellular mass forming a bud, resemble each other in
    all their functions&#8212;in their power of inheritance with
    occasional reversion,&#8212;and in their capacity for variation of
    the same general nature, in obedience to the same laws. This
    resemblance, or rather identity of character, is shown in the most
    striking manner by the fact that the cellular tissue of one species
    or variety, when budded or grafted on another, may give rise to a
    bud having an intermediate character. We have seen that variability
    does not depend on sexual generation, though much more frequently
    its concomitant than of bud reproduction. We have seen that
    bud-variability is not solely dependent on reversion or atavism to
    long-lost characters, or to those formerly acquired from a cross,
    but appears often to be spontaneous. But when we ask ourselves what
    is the cause of any particular bud-variation, we are lost in doubt,
    being driven in some cases to look to the direct action of the
    external conditions of life as sufficient, and in other cases to
    feel a profound conviction that these have played a quite
    subordinate part, of not more importance than the nature of the

      propagated by root-division, only seven or eight produced striped
      flowers. <I>See also</I> on striped Pelargoniums, 'Gardener's

      of Mauritius, says ('Gardener's Chronicle,' 1874, p. 316) the
      Ribbon cane has here "sported into a perfectly green cane and a
      perfectly red cane from the same head. I verified this myself,
      and saw at least 200 instances in the same plantation, and the
      fact has completely upset all our preconceived ideas of the
      difference of colour being permanent. The conversion of a striped
      cane into a green cane was not uncommon, but the change into a
      red cane universally disbelieved, and that both events should
      occur in the same plant incredible. I find, however, in
      Fleischman's 'Report on Sugar Cultivation in Louisiana for 1848,'

      intermediate in foliage, time of flowering, dark stri&#230; at
      the base of the standard petal, hairiness of the ovarium, and in
      almost every other character, between <I>C. laburnum</I> and <I>
      alpinus</I>; but it approaches the former species more nearly in
      colour, and exceeds it in the length of the racemes. We have
      before seen that 20&#183;3 per cent of its pollen-grains are
      ill-formed and worthless. My plant, though growing not above
      thirty or forty yards from both parent-species, during some
      seasons yielded no good seeds; but in 1866 it was unusually
      fertile, and its long racemes produced from one to occasionally
      even four pods. Many of the pods contained no good seeds, but
      generally they contained a single apparently good seed, sometimes
      two, and in one case three seeds. Some of these seeds germinated,
      and I raised two trees from them; one resembles the present form;
      the other has a remarkable dwarf character with small leaves, but
      has not yet flowered.</FONT></LI>

      several cases with respect to mares, sows, and dogs. Mr. W. C. L.
      Martin ('History of the Dog,' 1845, p. 104) says he can
      personally vouch for the influence of the male parent on
      subsequent litters by other dogs. A French poet, Jacques Savary,
      who wrote in 1665 on dogs, was aware of this singular fact. Dr.
      Bowerbank has given us the following striking case:&#8212;A
      black, hairless Barbary bitch was first accidentally impregnated
      by a mongrel spaniel with long brown hair, and she produced five
      puppies, three of which were hairless and two covered with <I>
      short</I> brown hair. The next time she was put to a black,
      hairless Barbary dog; "but the mischief had been implanted in the
      mother, and again about half the litter looked like pure
      Barbarys, and the other half like the <I>short</I>-haired progeny
      of the first father." I have given in the text one case with
      pigs; an equally striking one has been recently published in
      Germany, 'Illust. Landwirth. Zeitung,' 1868, Nov. 17th, p. 143.
      It is worth notice that farmers in S. Brazil (as I hear from
      Fritz M&#252;ller), and at the C. of Good Hope (as I have heard
      from two trustworthy persons) are convinced that mares which have
      once borne mules, when subsequently put to horses, are extremely
      liable to produce colts, striped like a mule. Dr. Wilckens, of
      Pogarth, gives ('Jahrbuch Landwirthschaft,' ii. 1869, p. 325) a
      striking and analogous case. A merino ram, having two small
      lappets or flaps of skin on the neck, was in the winter of
      1861-62 put to several Merino ewes, all of whom bore lambs with
      similar flaps on their necks. The ram was killed in the spring of
      1862 and subsequently to his death the ewes were put to other
      Merino rams, and in 1863 to Southdown rams, none of whom ever
      have neck lappets: nevertheless, even as long afterwards as 1867,
      several of these ewes produced lambs bearing these
      appendages.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">It may be worth while to call attention to the several means
      by which flowers and fruit become striped or mottled. Firstly, by
      the direct action of the pollen of another variety or species, as
      in the cases given of oranges and maize. Secondly, in crosses of
      the first generation, when the colours of the two parents do not
      readily unite, as with Mirabilis and Dianthus. Thirdly, in
      crossed plants of a subsequent generation by reversion, through
      either bud or seminal generation. Fourthly, by reversion to a
      character not originally gained by a cross, but which had long
      been lost, as with white-flowered varieties, which we shall
      hereafter see often become striped with some other colour.
      Lastly, there are cases, as when peaches are produced with a half
      or quarter of the fruit like a nectarine, in which the change is
      apparently due to mere variation, through either bud or seminal
      generation.</FONT></LI>
