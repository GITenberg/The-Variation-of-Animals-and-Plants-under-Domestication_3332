    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>The Fusion of Homologous
    Parts.</I>&#8212;Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire formerly propounded what he
    called <I>la loi de l'affinit&#233; de soi pour soi,</I> which has
    been discussed and illustrated by his son, Isidore, with respect to
    monsters in the animal kingdom,<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
    and by Moquin-Tandon, with respect to monstrous plants. This law
    seems to imply that homologous parts actually attract one another
    and then unite. No doubt there are many wonderful cases, in which
    such parts become intimately fused together. This is perhaps best
    seen in monsters with two heads, which are united, summit to
    summit, or face to face, or Janus-like, back to back, or obliquely
    side to side. In one instance of two heads united almost face to
    face, but a little obliquely, four ears were developed, and on one
    side a perfect face, which was manifestly formed by the fusion of
    two half-faces. Whenever two bodies or two heads are united, each
    bone, muscle, vessel, and nerve on the line of junction appears as
    if it had sought out its fellow, and had become completely fused
    with it. Lereboullet,<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> who
    carefully studied the development of double monsters in fishes,
    observed in fifteen instances the steps by which two heads
    gradually became united into one. In all such cases it is now
    thought by the greater number of capable judges that the homologous
    parts do not attract each other, but that in the words of Mr.
    Lowne:<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> "As union takes place
    before the differentiation of distinct organs occurs, these are
    formed in continuity with each other." He adds that organs already
    differentiated probably in no case become united to homologous
    ones. M. Dareste does not speak<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
    quite decisively against the law of <I>soi pour soi,</I> but
    concludes by saying, "On se rend parfaitement compte de la
    formation des monstres, si l'on admet que les embryons qui se
    soudent appartiennent &#224; un m&#234;me &#339;uf; qu'ils
    s'unissent en m&#234;me temps qu'ils se forment, et que la soudure
    ne se produit que pendant la premi&#232;re p&#233;riode de la vie
    embryonnaire, celle ou les organes ne sont encore constitu&#233;s
    que par des blast&#232;mes homog&#232;nes."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">By whatever means the abnormal fusion of
    homologous parts is effected, such cases throw light on the
    frequent presence of organs which are double during an embryonic
    period (and throughout life in other and lower members of the same
    class) but which afterwards unite by a normal process into a single
    medial organ. In the vegetable kingdom Moquin-Tandon<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> gives a long list of cases, showing how
    frequently homologous parts, such as leaves, petals, stamens, and
    pistils, flowers, and aggregates of homologous parts, such as buds,
    as well as fruit, become blended, both normally and abnormally,
    with perfect symmetry into one another.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>The Variability of Multiple and Homologous
    parts.</I>&#8212;Isidore Geoffroy<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
    insists that, when any part or organ is repeated many times in the
    same animal, it is particularly liable to vary both in number and
    structure. With respect to number, the proposition may, I think, be
    considered as fully established; but the evidence is chiefly
    derived from organic beings living under their natural conditions,
    with which we are not here concerned. Whenever such parts as the
    vertebrae or teeth, the rays in the fins of fishes, or the feathers
    in the tails of birds, or petals, stamens, pistils, or seeds, are
    very numerous, the number is generally variable. With respect to
    the structure of multiple parts, the evidence of variability is not
    so decisive; but the fact, as far as it may be trusted, probably
    depends on multiple parts being of less physiological importance
    than single parts; consequently their structure has been less
    rigorously guarded by natural selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Compensation of Growth, or
    Balancement.</I>&#8212;This law, as applied to natural species, was
    propounded by Goethe and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire at nearly the same
    time. It implies that, when much organised matter is used in
    building up some one part, other parts are starved and become
    reduced. Several authors, especially botanists, believe in this
    law; others reject it. As far as I can judge, it occasionally holds
    good; but its importance has probably been exaggerated. It is
    scarcely possible to distinguish between the supposed effects of
    such compensation, and the effects of long-continued selection
    which may lead to the augmentation of one part, and simultaneously
    to the diminution of another. Anyhow, there can be no doubt that an
    organ may be greatly increased without any corresponding diminution
    of an adjoining part. To recur to our former illustration of the
    Irish elk, it may be asked what part has suffered in consequence of
    the immense development of the horns?</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has already been observed that the struggle
    for existence does not bear hard on our domesticated productions,
    and consequently the principle of economy of growth will seldom
    come into play, so that we ought not to expect to find with them
    frequent evidence of compensation. We have, however, some such
    cases. Moquin-Tandon describes a monstrous bean, in which the
    stipules were enormously developed, and the leaflets apparently in
    consequence completely aborted; this case is interesting, as it
    represents the natural condition of <I>Lathyrus aphaca,</I> with
    its stipules of great size, and its leaves reduced to mere threads,
    which act as tendrils. De Candolle<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
    has remarked that the varieties of <I>Raphanus sativus</I> which
    have small roots yield numerous seed containing much oil, whilst
    those with large roots are not productive in oil; and so it is with
    <I>Brassica asperifolia.</I> The varieties of <I>Cucurbita pepo</I>
    which bear large fruit yield a small crop, according to Naudin;
    whilst those producing small fruit yield a vast number. Lastly, I
    have endeavoured to show in the eighteenth chapter that with many
    cultivated plants unnatural treatment checks the full and proper
    action of the reproductive organs, and they are thus rendered more
    or less sterile; consequently, in the way of compensation, the
    fruit becomes greatly enlarged, and, in double flowers, the petals
    are greatly increased in number.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With animals, it has been found difficult to
    produce cows which yield much milk, and are afterwards capable of
    fattening well. With fowls which have large top-knots and beards
    the comb and wattles are generally much reduced in size; though
    there are exceptions to this rule. Perhaps the entire absence of
    the oil-gland in fantail pigeons may be connected with the great
    development of their tails.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Mechanical Pressure as a Cause of
    Modifications.</I>&#8212;In some few cases there is reason to
    believe that mere mechanical pressure has affected certain
    structures. Vrolik and Weber<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
    maintain that the shape of the human head is influenced by the
    shape of the mother's pelvis. The kidneys in different birds differ
    much in form, and St. Ange<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
    believes that this is determined by the form of the pelvis, which
    again, no doubt, stands in close relation with their power of
    locomotion. In snakes, the viscera are curiously displaced, in
    comparison with their position in other vertebrates; and this has
    been attributed by some authors to the elongation of their bodies;
    but here, as in so many previous cases, it is impossible to
    disentangle a direct result of this kind from that consequent on
    natural selection. Godron has argued<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> that the abortion of the spur on the
    inner side of the flowers in Corydalis, is caused by the buds at a
    very early period of growth whilst underground being closely
    pressed against one another and against the stem. Some botanists
    believe that the singular difference in the shape both of the seed
    and corolla, in the interior and exterior florets in certain
    Compositous and Umbelliferous plants, is due to the pressure to
    which the inner florets are subjected; but this conclusion is
    doubtful.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The facts just given do not relate to
    domesticated productions, and therefore do not strictly concern us.
    But here is a more appropriate case: H. M&#252;ller<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> has shown that in shortfaced races of
    the dog some of the molar teeth are placed in a slightly different
    position to that which they occupy in other dogs, especially in
    those having elongated muzzles; and as he remarks, any inherited
    change in the arrangement of the teeth deserves notice, considering
    their classificatory importance. This difference in position is due
    to the shortening of certain facial bones and the consequent want
    of space; and the shortening results from a peculiar and abnormal
    state of the embryonal cartilages of the bones.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the thirteenth chapter various peloric
    flowers were described, and their production was shown to be due
    either to arrested development, or to reversion to a primordial
    condition. Moquin-Tandon has remarked that the flowers which stand
    on the summit of the main stem or of a lateral branch are more
    liable to become peloric than those on the sides;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> and he adduces, amongst other instances,
    that of <I>Teucrium campanulatum.</I> In another Labiate plant
    grown by me, viz., the <I>Galeobdolon luteum,</I> the peloric
    flowers were always produced on the summit of the stem, where
    flowers are not usually borne. In Pelargonium, a <I>single</I>
    flower in the truss is frequently peloric, and when this occurs I
    have during several years invariably observed it to be the central
    flower. This is of such frequent occurrence that one observer<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> gives the names of ten varieties
    flowering at the same time, in every one of which the central
    flower was peloric. Occasionally more than one flower in the truss
    is peloric, and then of course the additional ones must be lateral.
    These flowers are interesting as showing how the whole structure is
    correlated. In the common Pelargonium the upper sepal is produced
    into a nectary which coheres with the flower-peduncle; the two
    upper petals differ a little in shape from the three lower ones,
    and are marked with dark shades of colour; the stamens are
    graduated in length and upturned. In the peloric flowers, the
    nectary aborts; all the petals become alike both in shape and
    colour; the stamens are generally reduced in number and become
    straight, so that the whole flower resembles that of the allied
    genus Erodium. The correlation between these changes is well shown
    when one of the two upper petals alone loses its dark mark, for in
    this case the nectary does not entirely abort, but is usually much
    reduced in length.<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Morren has described<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> a marvellous flask-shaped flower of the
    Calceolaria, nearly four inches in length, which was almost
    completely peloric; it grew on the summit of the plant, with a
    normal flower on each side; Prof. Westwood also has described<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> three similar peloric flowers,
    which all occupied a central position on the flower-branches. In
    the Orchideous genus, Phal&#230;nopsis, the terminal flower has
    been seen to become peloric.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In a Laburnum-tree I observed that about
    a fourth part of the racemes produced terminal flowers which had
    lost their papilionaceous structure. These were produced after
    almost all the other flowers on the same racemes had withered. The
    most perfectly pelorised examples had six petals, each marked with
    black striae like those on the standard-petal. The keel seemed to
    resist the change more than the other petals. Dutrochet has
    described<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> an exactly similar case
    in France, and I believe these are the only two instances of
    pelorism in the laburnum which have been recorded. Dutrochet
    remarks that the racemes on this tree do not properly produce a
    terminal flower, so that (as in the case of the Galeobdolon) their
    position as well as structure are both anomalies, which no doubt
    are in some manner related. Dr. Masters has briefly described
    another leguminous plant,<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> namely,
    a species of clover, in which the uppermost and central flowers
    were regular or had lost their papilionaceous structure. In some of
    these plants the flower-heads were also proliferous.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Lastly, Linaria produces two kinds of
    peloric flowers, one having simple petals, and the other having
    them all spurred. The two forms, as Naudin remarks,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> not rarely occur on the same plant, but
    in this case the spurred form almost invariably stands on the
    summit of the spike.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The tendency in the terminal or central
    flower to become peloric more frequently than the other flowers,
    probably results from "the bud which stands on the end of a shoot
    receiving the most sap; it grows out into a stronger shoot than
    those situated lower down."<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> I
    have discussed the connection between pelorism and a central
    position, partly because some few plants are known normally to
    produce a terminal flower different in structure from the lateral
    ones; but chiefly on account of the following case, in which we see
    a tendency to variability or to reversion connected with the same
    position. A great judge of Auriculas<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> states that when one throws up a side
    bloom it is pretty sure to keep its character; but that if it grows
    from the centre or heart of the plant, whatever the colour of the
    edging ought to be, "it is just as likely to come in any other
    class as in the one to which it properly belongs." This is so
    notorious a fact, that some florists regularly pinch off the
    central trusses of flowers. Whether in the highly improved
    varieties the departure of the central trusses from their proper
    type is due to reversion, I do not know. Mr. Dombrain insists that,
    whatever may be the commonest kind of imperfection in each variety,
    this is generally exaggerated in the central truss. Thus one
    variety "sometimes has the fault of producing a little green floret
    in the centre of the flower," and in central blooms these become
    excessive in size. In some central blooms, sent to me by Mr.
    Dombrain, all the organs of the flower were rudimentary in
    structure, of minute size, and of a green colour, so that by a
    little further change all would have been converted into small
    leaves. In this case we clearly see a tendency to
    prolification&#8212;a term which I may explain, for those who have
    never attended to botany, to mean the production of a branch or
    flower, or head of flowers, out of another flower. Now Dr.
    Masters<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> states that the central
    or uppermost flower on a plant is generally the most liable to
    prolification. Thus, in the varieties of the Auricula, the loss of
    their proper character and a tendency to prolification, also a
    tendency to prolification with pelorism, are all connected
    together, and are due either to arrested development, or to
    reversion to a former condition.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The following is a more interesting case;
    Metzger<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> cultivated in Germany
    several kinds of maize brought from the hotter parts of America,
    and he found, as previously described, that in two or three
    generations the grains became greatly changed in form, size, and
    colour; and with respect to two races he expressly states that in
    the first generation, whilst the lower grains on each head retained
    their proper character, the uppermost grains already began to
    assume that character which in the third generation all the grains
    acquired. As we do not know the aboriginal parent of the maize, we
    cannot tell whether these changes are in any way connected with
    reversion.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the two following cases, reversion
    comes into play and is determined by the position of the seed in
    the capsule. The Blue Imperial pea is the offspring of the Blue
    Prussian, and has larger seed and broader pods than its parent. Now
    Mr. Masters, of Canterbury, a careful observer and a raiser of new
    varieties of the pea, states<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> that
    the Blue Imperial always has a strong tendency to revert to its
    parent-stock, and the reversion "occurs in this manner: the last
    (or uppermost) pea in the pod is frequently much smaller than the
    rest; and if these small peas are carefully collected and sown
    separately, very many more, in proportion, will revert to their
    origin, than those taken from the other parts of the pod." Again,
    M. Chat&#233;<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> says that in
    raising seedling stocks he succeeds in getting eighty per cent to
    bear double flowers, by leaving only a few of the secondary
    branches to seed; but in addition to this, "at the time of
    extracting the seeds, the upper portion of the pod is separated and
    placed aside, because it has been ascertained that the plants
    coming from the seeds situated in this portion of the pod, give
    eighty per cent of single flowers." Now the production of
    single-flowering plants from the seed of double-flowering plants is
    clearly a case of reversion. These latter facts, as well as the
    connection between a central position and pelorism and
    prolification, show in an interesting manner how small a
    difference&#8212;namely, a little greater or less freedom in the
    flow of sap towards one part of the plant&#8212;determines
    important changes of structure.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Analogous or Parallel Variation.</I>&#8212;By
    this term I mean that similar characters occasionally make their
    appearance in the several varieties or races descended from the
    same species, and more rarely in the offspring of widely distinct
    species. We are here concerned, not as hitherto with the causes of
    variation, but with the results; but this discussion could not have
    been more conveniently introduced elsewhere. The cases of analogous
    variation, as far as their origin is concerned, may be grouped,
    disregarding minor subdivisions, under two main heads; firstly,
    those due to unknown causes acting on similarly constituted
    organisms, and which consequently have varied in a similar manner;
    and secondly, those due to the reappearance of characters which
    were possessed by a more or less remote progenitor. But these two
    main divisions can often be separated only conjecturally, and
    graduate, as we shall presently see, into each other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Under the first head of analogous
    variations, not due to reversion, we have the many cases of trees
    belonging to quite different orders which have produced pendulous
    and fastigiate varieties. The beech, hazel, and barberry have given
    rise to purple-leaved varieties; and, as Bernhardi remarks,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> a multitude of plants, as distinct as
    possible, have yielded varieties with deeply-cut or laciniated
    leaves. Varieties descended from three distinct species of Brassica
    have their stems, or so-called roots, enlarged into globular
    masses. The nectarine is the offspring of the peach; and the
    varieties of peaches and nectarines offer a remarkable parallelism
    in the fruit being white, red, or yellow fleshed&#8212;in being
    clingstones or freestones&#8212;in the flowers being large or
    small&#8212;in the leaves being serrated or crenated, furnished
    with globose or reniform glands, or quite destitute of glands. It
    should be remarked that each variety of the nectarine has not
    derived its character from a corresponding variety of the peach.
    The several varieties also of a closely allied genus, namely the
    apricot, differ from one another in nearly the same parallel
    manner. There is no reason to believe that any of these varieties
    have merely reacquired long-lost characters; and in most of them
    this certainly is not the case.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Three species of Cucurbita have yielded a
    multitude of races which correspond so closely in character that,
    as Naudin insists, they may be arranged in almost strictly parallel
    series. Several varieties of the melon are interesting from
    resembling, in important characters, other species, either of the
    same genus or of allied genera; thus, one variety has fruit so
    like, both externally and internally, the fruit of a perfectly
    distinct species, namely, the cucumber, as hardly to be
    distinguished from it; another has long cylindrical fruit twisting
    about like a serpent; in another the seeds adhere to portions of
    the pulp; in another the fruit, when ripe, suddenly cracks and
    falls into pieces; and all these highly remarkable peculiarities
    are characteristic of species belonging to allied genera. We can
    hardly account for the appearance of so many unusual characters by
    reversion to a single ancient form; but we must believe that all
    the members of the family have inherited a nearly similar
    constitution from an early progenitor. Our cereal and many other
    plants offer similar cases.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With animals we have fewer cases of
    analogous variation, independently of direct reversion. We see
    something of the kind in the resemblance between the short-muzzled
    races of the dog, such as the pug and bull-dog; in feather-footed
    races of the fowl, pigeon, and canary-bird; in horses of the most
    different races presenting the same range of colour; in all
    black-and-tan dogs having tan-coloured eye-spots and feet, but in
    this latter case reversion may possibly have played a part. Low has
    remarked<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> that several breeds of
    cattle are "sheeted,"&#8212;that is, have a broad band of white
    passing round their bodies like a sheet; this character is strongly
    inherited, and sometimes originates from a cross; it may be the
    first step in reversion to an early type, for, as was shown in the
    third chapter, white cattle with dark ears, dark feet and tip of
    tail, formerly existed, and now exist in feral or semi-feral
    condition in several quarters of the world.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Under our second main division, namely,
    of analogous variations due to reversion, the best cases are
    afforded by pigeons. In all the most distinct breeds, sub-varieties
    occasionally appear coloured exactly like the parent rock-pigeon,
    with black wing-bars, white loins, banded tail, etc.; and no one
    can doubt that these characters are due to reversion. So with minor
    details; turbits properly have white tails, but occasionally a bird
    is born with a dark-coloured and banded tail; pouters properly have
    their primary wing-feathers white, but not rarely a
    "sword-flighted" bird appears, that is, one with the few first
    primaries dark-coloured; and in these cases we have characters
    proper to the rock-pigeon, but new to the breed, evidently
    appearing from reversion. In some domestic varieties the wing-bars,
    instead of being simply black, as in the rock-pigeon, are
    beautifully edged with different zones of colour, and they then
    present a striking analogy with the wing-bars in certain natural
    species of the same family, such as <I>Phaps chalcoptera</I>; and
    this may probably be accounted for by all the species of the family
    being descended from the same remote progenitor and having a
    tendency to vary in the same manner. Thus, also, we can perhaps
    understand the fact of some Laugher-pigeons cooing almost like
    turtle-doves, and for several races having peculiarities in their
    flight, since certain natural species (viz., <I>C. torquatrix</I>
    and <I>palumbus</I>), display singular vagaries in this respect. In
    other cases a race, instead of imitating a distinct species,
    resembles some other race; thus, certain runts tremble and slightly
    elevate their tails, like fantails; and turbits inflate the upper
    part of their oesophagus, like pouter-pigeons.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is a common circumstance to find
    certain coloured marks persistently characterising all the species
    of a genus, but differing much in tint; and the same thing occurs
    with the varieties of the pigeon: thus, instead of the general
    plumage being blue, with the wing-bars black, there are snow-white
    varieties with red bars, and black varieties with white bars; in
    other varieties the wing-bars, as we have seen, are elegantly zoned
    with different tints. The Spot pigeon is characterised by the whole
    plumage being white, excepting a spot on the forehead and the tail;
    but these parts may be red, yellow, or black. In the rock-pigeon
    and in many varieties the tail is blue, with the outer edges of the
    outer feathers white; but in the sub-variety of the monk-pigeon we
    have a reversed style of coloration, for the tail is white, except
    the outer edges of the outer feathers, which are black.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With some species of birds, for instance
    with gulls, certain coloured parts appear as if almost washed out,
    and I have observed exactly the same appearance in the terminal
    dark tail-bar in certain pigeons, and in the whole plumage of
    certain varieties of the duck. Analogous facts in the vegetable
    kingdom could be given.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Many sub-varieties of the pigeon have
    reversed and somewhat lengthened feathers on the back part of their
    heads, and this is certainly not due to reversion to the
    parent-species, which shows no trace of such structure: but when we
    remember that sub-varieties of the fowl, turkey, canary-bird, duck,
    and goose, all have either topknots or reversed feathers on their
    heads; and when we remember that scarcely a single large natural
    group of birds can be named, in which some members have not a tuft
    of feathers on their heads, we may suspect that reversion to some
    extremely remote form has come into action.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Several breeds of the fowl have either
    spangled or pencilled feathers; and these cannot be derived from
    the parent-species, the <I>Gallus bankiva</I>; though of course it
    is possible that one early progenitor of this species may have been
    spangled, and another pencilled. But, as many gallinaceous birds
    are either spangled or pencilled, it is a more probable view that
    the several domestic breeds of the fowl have acquired this kind of
    plumage from all the members of the family inheriting a tendency to
    vary in a like manner. The same principle may account for the ewes
    in certain breeds of sheep being hornless, like the females of some
    other hollow-horned ruminants; it may account for certain domestic
    cats having slightly-tufted ears, like those of the lynx; and for
    the skulls of domestic rabbits often differing from one another in
    the same characters by which the skulls of the various species of
    the genus Lepus differ.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will only allude to one other case,
    already discussed. Now that we know that the wild parent of the ass
    commonly has striped legs, we may feel confident that the
    occasional appearance of stripes on the legs of the domestic ass is
    due to reversion; but this will not account for the lower end of
    the shoulder-stripe being sometimes angularly bent or slightly
    forked. So, again, when we see dun and other coloured horses with
    stripes on the spine, shoulders, and legs, we are led, from reasons
    formerly given, to believe that they reappear through reversion to
    the wild parent-horse. But when horses have two or three
    shoulder-stripes, with one of them occasionally forked at the lower
    end, or when they have stripes on their faces, or are faintly
    striped as foals over nearly their whole bodies, with the stripes
    angularly bent one under the other on the forehead, or irregularly
    branched in other parts, it would be rash to attribute such
    diversified characters to the reappearance of those proper to the
    aboriginal wild horse. As three African species of the genus are
    much striped, and as we have seen that the crossing of the
    unstriped species often leads to the hybrid offspring being
    conspicuously striped&#8212;bearing also in mind that the act of
    crossing certainly causes the reappearance of long-lost
    characters&#8212;it is a more probable view that the
    above-specified stripes are due to reversion, not to the immediate
    wild parent-horse, but to the striped progenitor of the whole
    genus.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have discussed this subject of analogous
    variation at considerable length, because it is well known that the
    varieties of one species frequently resemble distinct
    species&#8212;a fact in perfect harmony with the foregoing cases,
    and explicable on the theory of descent. Secondly, because these
    facts are important from showing, as remarked in a former chapter,
    that each trifling variation is governed by law, and is determined
    in a much higher degree by the nature of the organisation, than by
    the nature of the conditions to which the varying being has been
    exposed. Thirdly, because these facts are to a certain extent
    related to a more general law, namely, that which Mr. B. D. Walsh<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> has called the "Law of <I>Equable
    Variability,</I>" or, as he explains it, "if any given character is
    very variable in one species of a group, it will tend to be
    variable in allied species; and if any given character is perfectly
    constant in one species of a group, it will tend to be constant in
    allied species."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This leads me to recall a discussion in the
    chapter on Selection, in which it was shown that with domestic
    races, which are now undergoing rapid improvement, those parts or
    characters vary the most, which are the most valued. This naturally
    follows from recently selected characters continually tending to
    revert to their former less improved standard, and from their being
    still acted on by the same agencies, whatever these may be, which
    first caused the characters in question to vary. The same principle
    is applicable to natural species, for, as stated in my 'Origin of
    Species' generic characters are less variable than specific
    characters; and the latter are those which have been modified by
    variation and natural selection, since the period when all the
    species belonging to the genus branched off from a common
    progenitor, whilst generic characters are those which have remained
    unaltered from a much more remote epoch, and accordingly are now
    less variable. This statement makes a near approach to Mr. Walsh's
    law of Equable Variability. Secondary sexual characters, it may be
    added, rarely serve to characterise distinct genera, for they
    usually differ much in the species of the same genus, and they are
    highly variable in the individuals of the same species; we have
    also seen in the earlier chapters of this work how variable
    secondary sexual characters become under domestication.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Summary of the three previous Chapters on the Laws of
      Variation.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the twenty-third chapter we saw that changed
    conditions occasionally, or even often, act in a definite manner on
    the organisation, so that all, or nearly all, the individuals thus
    exposed become modified in the same manner. But a far more frequent
    result of changed conditions, whether acting directly on the
    organisation or indirectly through the reproductive system, is
    indefinite and fluctuating variability. In the three last chapters,
    some of the laws by which such variability is regulated have been
    discussed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Increased use adds to the size of muscles,
    together with the blood-vessels, nerves, ligaments, the crests of
    bone and the whole bones, to which they are attached. Increased
    functional activity increases the size of various glands, and
    strengthens the sense-organs. Increased and intermittent pressure
    thickens the epidermis. A change in the nature of the food
    sometimes modifies the coats of the stomach, and augments or
    decreases the length of the intestines. Continued disuse, on the
    other hand, weakens and diminishes all parts of the organisation.
    Animals which during many generations have taken but little
    exercise, have their lungs reduced in size, and as a consequence
    the bony fabric of the chest and the whole form of the body become
    modified. With our anciently domesticated birds, the wings have
    been little used, and they are slightly reduced; with their
    decrease, the crest of the sternum, the scapulae, coracoids, and
    furculum, have all been reduced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With domesticated animals, the reduction of a
    part from disuse is never carried so far that a mere rudiment is
    left; whereas we have reason to believe that this has often
    occurred under nature; the effects of disuse in this latter case
    being aided by economy of growth, together with the intercrossing
    of many varying individuals. The cause of this difference between
    organisms in a state of nature, and under domestication, probably
    is that in the latter case there has not been time sufficient for
    any very great change, and that the principle of economy of growth
    does not come into action. On the contrary, structures which are
    rudimentary in the parent-species, sometimes become partially
    redeveloped in our domesticated productions. Such rudiments as
    occasionally make their appearance under domestication, seem always
    to be the result of a sudden arrest of development; nevertheless
    they are of interest, as showing that rudiments are the relics of
    organs once perfectly developed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Corporeal, periodical, and mental habits, though
    the latter have been almost passed over in this work, become
    changed under domestication, and the changes are often inherited.
    Such changed habits in an organic being, especially when living a
    free life, would often lead to the augmented or diminished use of
    various organs, and consequently to their modification. From
    long-continued habit, and more especially from the occasional birth
    of individuals with a slightly different constitution, domestic
    animals and cultivated plants become to a certain extent
    acclimatised or adapted to a climate different from that proper to
    the parent-species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Through the principle of correlated variability,
    taken in its widest sense, when one part varies other parts vary,
    either simultaneously, or one after the other. Thus, an organ
    modified during an early embryonic period affects other parts
    subsequently developed. When an organ, such as the beak, increases
    or decreases in length, adjoining or correlated parts, as the
    tongue and the orifice of the nostrils, tend to vary in the same
    manner. When the whole body increases or decreases in size, various
    parts become modified; thus, with pigeons the ribs increase or
    decrease in number and breadth. Homologous parts which are
    identical during their early development and are exposed to similar
    conditions, tend to vary in the same or in some connected
    manner,&#8212;as in the case of the right and left sides of the
    body, and of the front and hind limbs. So it is with the organs of
    sight and hearing; for instance, white cats with blue eyes are
    almost always deaf. There is a manifest relation throughout the
    body between the skin and various dermal appendages, such as hair,
    feathers, hoofs, horns, and teeth. In Paraguay, horses with curly
    hair have hoofs like those of a mule; the wool and the horns of
    sheep often vary together; hairless dogs are deficient in their
    teeth; men with redundant hair have abnormal teeth, either by
    deficiency or excess. Birds with long wing-feathers usually have
    long tail-feathers. When long feathers grow from the outside of the
    legs and toes of pigeons, the two outer toes are connected by
    membrane; for the whole leg tends to assume the structure of the
    wing. There is a manifest relation between a crest of feathers on
    the head and a marvellous amount of change in the skull of various
    fowls; and in a lesser degree, between the greatly elongated,
    lopping ears of rabbits and the structure of their skulls. With
    plants, the leaves, various parts of the flower, and the fruit,
    often vary together to a correlated manner.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In some cases we find correlation without being
    able even to conjecture what is the nature of the connection, as
    with various monstrosities and diseases. This is likewise the case
    with the colour of the adult pigeon, in connection with the
    presence of down on the young bird. Numerous curious instances have
    been given of peculiarities of constitution, in correlation with
    colour, as shown by the immunity of individuals of one colour from
    certain diseases, from the attacks of parasites and from the action
    of certain vegetable poisons.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Correlation is an important subject; for with
    species, and in a lesser degree with domestic races, we continually
    find that certain parts have been greatly modified to serve some
    useful purpose; but we almost invariably find that other parts have
    likewise been more or less modified, without our being able to
    discover any advantage in the change. No doubt great caution is
    necessary with respect to this latter point, for it is difficult to
    overrate our ignorance on the use of various parts of the
    organisation; but from what we have seen, we may believe that many
    modifications are of no direct service, having arisen in
    correlation with other and useful changes.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Homologous parts during their early development
    often become fused together. Multiple and homologous organs are
    especially liable to vary in number and probably in form. As the
    supply of organised matter is not unlimited, the principle of
    compensation sometimes comes into action; so that, when one part is
    greatly developed, adjoining parts are apt to be reduced; but this
    principle is probably of much less importance than the more general
    one of the economy of growth. Through mere mechanical pressure hard
    parts occasionally affect adjoining parts. With plants the position
    of the flowers on the axis, and of the seeds in the ovary,
    sometimes leads, through a more or less free flow of sap, to
    changes of structure; but such changes are often due to reversion.
    Modifications, in whatever manner caused, will be to a certain
    extent regulated by that co-ordinating power, or so-called <I>nisus
    formativus,</I> which is in fact a remnant of that simple form of
    reproduction, displayed by many lowly organised beings in their
    power of fissiparous generation and budding. Finally, the effects
    of the laws which directly or indirectly govern variability, may be
    largely regulated by man's selection, and will so far be determined
    by natural selection that changes advantageous to any race will be
    favoured, and disadvantageous changes will be checked.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Domestic races descended from the same species,
    or from two or more allied species, are liable to revert to
    characters derived from their common progenitor; and, as they
    inherit a somewhat similar constitution, they are liable to vary in
    the same manner. From these two causes analogous varieties often
    arise. When we reflect on the several foregoing laws, imperfectly
    as we understand them, and when we bear in mind how much remains to
    be discovered, we need not be surprised at the intricate and to us
    unintelligible manner in which our domestic productions have
    varied, and still go on varying.</P>
