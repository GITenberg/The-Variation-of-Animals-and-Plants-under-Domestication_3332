    <P align="JUSTIFY">All parts of the organisation are to a certain
    extent connected together; but the connection may be so slight that
    it hardly exists, as with compound animals or the buds on the same
    tree. Even in the higher animals various parts are not at all
    closely related; for one part may be wholly suppressed or rendered
    monstrous without any other part of the body being affected. But in
    some cases, when one part varies, certain other parts always, or
    nearly always, simultaneously vary; they are then subject to the
    law of correlated variation. The whole body is admirably
    co-ordinated for the peculiar habits of life of each organic being,
    and may be said, as the Duke of Argyll insists in his 'Reign of
    Law' to be correlated for this purpose. Again, in large groups of
    animals certain structures always co-exist: for instance, a
    peculiar form of stomach with teeth of peculiar form, and such
    structures may in one sense be said to be correlated. But these
    cases have no necessary connection with the law to be discussed in
    the present chapter; for we do not know that the initial or primary
    variations of the several parts were in any way related: slight
    modifications or individual differences may have been preserved,
    first in one and then in another part, until the final and
    perfectly co-adapted structure was acquired; but to this subject I
    shall presently recur. Again, in many groups of animals the males
    alone are furnished with weapons, or are ornamented with gay
    colours; and these characters manifestly stand in some sort of
    correlation with the male reproductive organs, for when the latter
    are destroyed these characters disappear. But it was shown in the
    twelfth chapter that the very same peculiarity may become attached
    at any age to either sex, and afterwards be exclusively transmitted
    to the same sex at a corresponding age. In these cases we have
    inheritance limited by both sex and age; but we have no reason for
    supposing that the original cause of the variation was necessarily
    connected with the reproductive organs, or with the age of the
    affected being.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In cases of true correlated variation, we are
    sometimes able to see the nature of the connection; but in most
    cases it is hidden from us, and certainly differs in different
    cases. We can seldom say which of two correlated parts first
    varies, and induces a change in the other; or whether the two are
    the effects of some common cause. Correlated variation is an
    important subject for us; for when one part is modified through
    continued selection, either by man or under nature, other parts of
    the organisation will be unavoidably modified. From this
    correlation it apparently follows that with our domesticated
    animals and plants, varieties rarely or never differ from one
    another by a single character alone.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">One of the simplest cases of correlation is that
    a modification which arises during an early stage of growth tends
    to influence the subsequent development of the same part, as well
    as of other and intimately connected parts. Isidore Geoffroy
    Saint-Hilaire states<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> that this may
    constantly be observed with monstrosities in the animal kingdom;
    and Moquin-Tandon<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> remarks, that,
    as with plants the axis cannot become monstrous without in some way
    affecting the organs subsequently produced from it, so axial
    anomalies are almost always accompanied by deviations of structure
    in the appended parts. We shall presently see that with
    short-muzzled races of the dog certain histological changes in the
    basal elements of the bones arrest their development and shorten
    them, and this affects the position of the subsequently developed
    molar teeth. It is probable that certain modifications in the
    larv&#230; of insects would affect the structure of the mature
    insects. But we must be careful not to extend this view too far,
    for during the normal course of development, certain species pass
    through an extraordinary course of change, whilst other and closely
    allied species arrive at maturity with little change of
    structure.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Another simple case of correlation is that with
    the increased or decreased dimensions of the whole body, or of any
    particular part, certain organs are increased or diminished in
    number, or are otherwise modified. Thus pigeon fanciers have gone
    on selecting pouters for length of body, and we have seen that
    their vertebrae are generally increased not only in size but in
    number, and their ribs in breadth. Tumblers have been selected for
    their small bodies, and their ribs and primary wing-feathers are
    generally lessened in number. Fantails have been selected for their
    large widely-expanded tails, with numerous tail-feathers, and the
    caudal vertebrae are increased in size and number. Carriers have
    been selected for length of beak, and their tongues have become
    longer, but not in strict accordance with the length of beak. In
    this latter breed and in others having large feet, the number of
    the scutellae on the toes is greater than in the breeds with small
    feet. Many similar cases could be given. In Germany it has been
    observed that the period of gestation is longer in large than in
    small breeds of cattle. With our highly-improved breeds of all
    kinds, the periods of maturity and of reproduction have advanced
    with respect to the age of the animal; and, in correspondence with
    this, the teeth are now developed earlier than formerly, so that,
    to the surprise of agriculturists, the ancient rules for judging of
    the age of an animal by the state of its teeth are no longer
    trustworthy.<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Correlated Variation of Homologous
    Parts.</I>&#8212;Parts which are homologous tend to vary in the
    same manner; and this is what might have been expected, for such
    parts are identical in form and structure during an early period of
    embryonic development, and are exposed in the egg or womb to
    similar conditions. The symmetry, in most kinds of animals, of the
    corresponding or homologous organs on the right and left sides of
    the body, is the simplest case in point; but this symmetry
    sometimes fails, as with rabbits having only one ear, or stags with
    one horn, or with many-horned sheep which sometimes carry an
    additional horn on one side of their heads. With flowers which have
    regular corollas, all the petals generally vary in the same manner,
    as we see in the complicated and symmetrical pattern, on the
    flowers, for instance, of the Chinese pink; but with irregular
    flowers, though the petals are of course homologous, this symmetry
    often fails, as with the varieties of the <I>Antirrhinum</I> or
    snapdragon, or that variety of the kidney-bean (<I>Phaseolus</I>)
    which has a white standard-petal.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the Vertebrata the front and hind limbs are
    homologous, and they tend to vary in the same manner, as we see in
    long and short legged, or in thick and thin legged races of the
    horse and dog. Isidore Geoffroy<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
    has remarked on the tendency of supernumerary digits in man to
    appear, not only on the right and left sides, but on the upper and
    lower extremities. Meckel has insisted<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> that, when the muscles of the arm depart
    in number or arrangement from their proper type, they almost always
    imitate those of the leg; and so conversely the varying muscles of
    the leg imitate the normal muscles of the arm.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In several distinct breeds of the pigeon and
    fowl, the legs and the two outer toes are heavily feathered, so
    that in the trumpeter pigeon they appear like little wings. In the
    feather-legged bantam the "boots" or feathers, which grow from the
    outside of the leg and generally from the two outer toes, have,
    according to the excellent authority of Mr. Hewitt,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> been seen to exceed the wing-feathers in
    length, and in one case were actually nine and a half inches long!
    As Mr. Blyth has remarked to me, these leg-feathers resemble the
    primary wing-feathers, and are totally unlike the fine down which
    naturally grows on the legs of some birds, such as grouse and owls.
    Hence it may be suspected that excess of food has first given
    redundancy to the plumage, and then that the law of homologous
    variation has led to the development of feathers on the legs, in a
    position corresponding with those on the wing, namely, on the
    outside of the tarsi and toes. I am strengthened in this belief by
    the following curious case of correlation, which for a long time
    seemed to me utterly inexplicable, namely, that in pigeons of any
    breed, if the legs are feathered, the two outer toes are partially
    connected by skin. These two outer toes correspond with our third
    and fourth toes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Now, in the wing
    of the pigeon or of any other bird, the first and fifth digits are
    aborted; the second is rudimentary and carries the so-called
    "bastard-wing;" whilst the third and fourth digits are completely
    united and enclosed by skin, together forming the extremity of the
    wing. So that in feather-footed pigeons, not only does the exterior
    surface support a row of long feathers, like wing-feathers, but the
    very same digits which in the wing are completely united by skin
    become partially united by skin in the feet; and thus by the law of
    the correlated variation of homologous parts we can understand the
    curious connection of feathered legs and membrane between the two
    outer toes.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Andrew Knight<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
    has remarked that the face or head and the limbs usually vary
    together in general proportions. Compare, for instance, the limbs
    of a dray and race horse, or of a greyhound and mastiff. What a
    monster a greyhound would appear with the head of a mastiff! The
    modern bulldog, however, has fine limbs, but this is a
    recently-selected character. From the measurements given in the
    sixth chapter, we see that in several breeds of the pigeon the
    length of the beak and the size of the feet are correlated. The
    view which, as before explained, seems the most probable is, that
    disuse in all cases tends to diminish the feet, the beak becoming
    at the same time shorter through correlation; but that in some few
    breeds in which length of beak has been a selected point, the feet,
    notwithstanding disuse, have increased in size through correlation.
    In the following case some kind of correlation is seen to exist
    between the feet and beak: several specimens have been sent to Mr.
    Bartlett at different times, as hybrids between ducks and fowls,
    and I have seen one; these were, as might be expected, ordinary
    ducks in a semi-monstrous condition, and in all of them the
    swimming-web between the toes was quite deficient or much reduced,
    and in all the beak was narrow and ill-shaped.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With the increased length of the beak in
    pigeons, not only the tongue increases in length, but likewise the
    orifice of the nostrils. But the increased length of the orifice of
    the nostrils perhaps stands in closer correlation with the
    development of the corrugated skin or wattle at the base of the
    beak, for when there is much wattle round the eyes, the eyelids are
    greatly increased or even doubled in length.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is apparently some correlation even in
    colour between the head and the extremities. Thus with horses a
    large white star or blaze on the forehead is generally accompanied
    by white feet.<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> With white rabbits
    and cattle, dark marks often co-exist on the tips of the ears and
    on the feet. In black and tan dogs of different breeds,
    tan-coloured spots over the eyes and tan-coloured feet almost
    invariably go together. These latter cases of connected colouring
    may be due either to reversion or to analogous
    variation,&#8212;subjects to which I shall hereafter
    return,&#8212;but this does not necessarily determine the question
    of their original correlation. Mr. H. W. Jackson informs me that he
    has observed many hundred white-footed cats, and he finds that all
    are more or less conspicuously marked with white on the front of
    the neck or chest.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The lopping forwards and downwards of the
    immense ears of fancy rabbits seems partly due to the disuse of the
    muscles, and partly to the weight and length of the ears, which
    have been increased by selection during many generations. Now, with
    the increased size and changed direction of the ears not only has
    the bony auditory meatus become changed in outline, direction, and
    greatly in size, but the whole skull has been slightly modified.
    This could be clearly seen in "half-lops"&#8212;that is, in rabbits
    with only one ear lopping forward&#8212; for the opposite sides of
    their skulls were not strictly symmetrical. This seems to me a
    curious instance of correlation, between hard bones and organs so
    soft and flexible, as well as so unimportant under a physiological
    point of view, as the external ears. The result no doubt is largely
    due to mere mechanical action, that is, to the weight of the ears,
    on the same principle that the skull of a human infant is easily
    modified by pressure.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The skin and the appendages of hair, feathers,
    hoofs, horns, and teeth, are homologous over the whole body. Every
    one knows that the colour of the skin and that of the hair usually
    vary together; so that Virgil advises the shepherd to look whether
    the mouth and tongue of the ram are black, lest the lambs should
    not be purely white. The colour of the skin and hair, and the odour
    emitted by the glands of the skin, are said<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> to be connected, even in the same race
    of men. Generally the hair varies in the same way all over the body
    in length, fineness, and curliness. The same rule holds good with
    feathers, as we see with the laced and frizzled breeds both of
    fowls and pigeons. In the common cock the feathers on the neck and
    loins are always of a particular shape, called hackles: now in the
    Polish breed, both sexes are characterised by a tuft of feathers on
    the head, and through correlation these feathers in the male always
    assume the form of hackles. The wing and tail-feathers, though
    arising from parts not homologous, vary in length together; so that
    long or short winged pigeons generally have long or short tails.
    The case of the Jacobin-pigeon is more curious, for the wing and
    tail feathers are remarkably long; and this apparently has arisen
    in correlation with the elongated and reversed feathers on the back
    of the neck, which form the hood.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The hoofs and hair are homologous appendages;
    and a careful observer, namely Azara,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> states that in Paraguay horses of
    various colours are often born with their hair curled and twisted
    like that on the head of a negro. This peculiarity is strongly
    inherited. But what is remarkable is that the hoofs of these horses
    "are absolutely like those of a mule." The hair also of their manes
    and tails is invariably much shorter than usual, being only from
    four to twelve inches in length; so that curliness and shortness of
    the hair are here, as with the negro, apparently correlated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the horns of sheep, Youatt<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> remarks that "multiplicity of horns
    is not found in any breed of much value; it is generally
    accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece." Several
    tropical breeds of sheep which are clothed with hair instead of
    wool, have horns almost like those of a goat. Sturm<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> expressly declares that in different
    races the more the wool is curled the more the horns are spirally
    twisted. We have seen in the third chapter, where other analogous
    facts have been given, that the parent of the Mauchamp breed, so
    famous for its fleece, had peculiarly shaped horns. The inhabitants
    of Angora assert<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> that "only the
    white goats which have horns wear the fleece in the long curly
    locks that are so much admired; those which are not horned having a
    comparatively close coat." From these cases we may infer that the
    hair or wool and the horns tend to vary in a correlated manner.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> Those who have tried hydropathy are
    aware that the frequent application of cold water stimulates the
    skin; and whatever stimulates the skin tends to increase the growth
    of the hair, as is well shown in the abnormal growth of hair near
    old inflamed surfaces. Now, Professor Low<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> is convinced that with the different
    races of British cattle thick skin and long hair depend on the
    humidity of the climate which they inhabit. We can thus see how a
    humid climate might act on the horns&#8212;in the first place
    directly on the skin and hair, and secondly by correlation on the
    horns. The presence or absence of horns, moreover, both in the case
    of sheep and cattle, acts, as will presently be shown, by some sort
    of correlation on the skull.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to hair and teeth, Mr. Yarrell<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> found many of the teeth deficient
    in three hairless "Egyptian dogs," and in a hairless terrier. The
    incisors, canines, and the premolars suffered most, but in one case
    all the teeth, except the large tubercular molar on each side, were
    deficient. With man several striking cases have been recorded<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> of inherited baldness with
    inherited deficiency, either complete or partial, of the teeth. I
    may give an analogous case, communicated to me by Mr. W.
    Wedderburn, of a Hindoo family in Scinde, in which ten men, in the
    course of four generations, were furnished, in both jaws taken
    together, with only four small and weak incisor teeth and with
    eight posterior molars. The men thus affected have very little hair
    on the body, and become bald early in life. They also suffer much
    during hot weather from excessive dryness of the skin. It is
    remarkable that no instance has occurred of a daughter being thus
    affected; and this fact reminds us how much more liable men are in
    England to become bald than women. Though the daughters in the
    above family are never affected, they transmit the tendency to
    their sons; and no case has occurred of a son transmitting it to
    his sons. The affection thus appears only in alternate generations,
    or after longer intervals. There is a similar connection between
    hair and teeth, according to Mr. Sedgwick, in those rare cases in
    which the hair has been renewed in old age, for this has "usually
    been accompanied by a renewal of the teeth." I have remarked in a
    former part of this volume that the great reduction in the size of
    the tusks in domestic boars probably stands in close relation with
    their diminished bristles, due to a certain amount of protection;
    and that the reappearance of the tusks in boars, which have become
    feral and are fully exposed to the weather, probably depends on the
    reappearance of the bristles. I may add, though not strictly
    connected with our present point, that an agriculturist<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> asserts that "pigs with little hair on
    their bodies are most liable to lose their tails, showing a
    weakness of the tegumental structure. It may be prevented by
    crossing with a more hairy breed."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the previous cases deficient hair, and teeth
    deficient in number or size, are apparently connected. In the
    following cases abnormally redundant hair, and teeth either
    deficient or redundant, are likewise connected. Mr. Crawfurd<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> saw at the Burmese Court a man,
    thirty years old, with his whole body, except the hands and feet,
    covered with straight silky hair, which on the shoulders and spine
    was five inches in length. At birth the ears alone were covered. He
    did not arrive at puberty, or shed his milk teeth, until twenty
    years old; and at this period he acquired five teeth in the upper
    jaw, namely, four incisors and one canine, and four incisor teeth
    in the lower jaw; all the teeth were small. This man had a daughter
    who was born with hair within her ears; and the hair soon extended
    over her body. When Captain Yule<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
    visited the Court, he found this girl grown up; and she presented a
    strange appearance with even her nose densely covered with soft
    hair. Like her father, she was furnished with incisor teeth alone.
    The King had with difficulty bribed a man to marry her, and of her
    two children, one, a boy fourteen months old, had hair growing out
    of his ears, with a beard and moustache. This strange peculiarity
    has, therefore, been inherited for three generations, with the
    molar teeth deficient in the grandfather and mother; whether these
    teeth would likewise fail in the infant could not then be told.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A parallel case of a man fifty-five years old,
    and of his son, with their faces covered with hair, has recently
    occurred in Russia. Dr. Alex. Brandt has sent me an account of this
    case, together with specimens of the extremely fine hair from the
    cheeks. The man is deficient in teeth, possessing only four
    incisors in the lower and two in the upper jaw. His son, about
    three years old, has no teeth except four lower incisors. The case,
    as Dr. Brandt remarks in his letter, no doubt is due to an arrest
    of development in the hair and teeth. We here see how independent
    of the ordinary conditions of existence such arrests must be, for
    the lives of a Russian peasant and of a native of Burmah are as
    different as possible.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Here is another and somewhat different case
    communicated to me by Mr. Wallace on the authority of Dr. Purland,
    a dentist: Julia Pastrana, a Spanish dancer, was a remarkably fine
    woman, but she had a thick masculine beard and a hairy forehead;
    she was photographed, and her stuffed skin was exhibited as a show;
    but what concerns us is, that she had in both the upper and lower
    jaw an irregular double set of teeth, one row being placed within
    the other, of which Dr. Purland took a cast. From the redundancy of
    teeth her mouth projected, and her face had a gorilla-like
    appearance. These cases and those of the hairless dogs forcibly
    call to mind the fact, that the two orders of mammals&#8212;namely,
    the Edentata and Cetacea&#8212;which are the most abnormal in their
    dermal covering, are likewise the most abnormal either by
    deficiency or redundancy of teeth.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The organs of sight and hearing are generally
    admitted to be homologous with one another and with various dermal
    appendages; hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected
    in conjunction. Mr. White Cowper says "that in all cases of double
    microphthalmia brought under his notice he has at the same time met
    with defective development of the dental system." Certain forms of
    blindness seem to be associated with the colour of the hair; a man
    with black hair and a woman with light-coloured hair, both of sound
    constitution, married and had nine children, all of whom were born
    blind; of these children, five "with dark hair and brown iris were
    afflicted with amaurosis; the four others, with light-coloured hair
    and blue iris, had amaurosis and cataract conjoined." Several cases
    could be given, showing that some relation exists between various
    affections of the eyes and ears; thus Liebreich states that out of
    241 deaf-mutes in Berlin, no less than fourteen suffered from the
    rare disease called pigmentary retinitis. Mr. White Cowper and Dr.
    Earle have remarked that inability to distinguish different
    colours, or colour-blindness, "is often associated with a
    corresponding inability to distinguish musical sounds."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Here is a more curious case: white cats, if they
    have blue eyes, are almost always deaf. I formerly thought that the
    rule was invariable, but I have heard of a few authentic
    exceptions. The first two notices were published in 1829 and relate
    to English and Persian cats: of the latter, the Rev. W. T. Bree
    possessed a female, and he states, "that of the offspring produced
    at one and the same birth, such as, like the mother, were entirely
    white (with blue eyes) were, like her, invariably deaf; while those
    that had the least speck of colour on their fur, as invariably
    possessed the usual faculty of hearing."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> The Rev. W. Darwin Fox informs me that
    he has seen more than a dozen instances of this correlation in
    English, Persian, and Danish cats; but he adds "that, if one eye,
    as I have several times observed, be not blue, the cat hears. On
    the other hand, I have never seen a white cat with eyes of the
    common colour that was deaf." In France Dr. Sichel<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> has observed during twenty years similar
    facts; he adds the remarkable case of the iris beginning, at the
    end of four months, to grow dark-coloured, and then the cat first
    began to hear.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This case of correlation in cats has struck many
    persons as marvellous. There is nothing unusual in the relation
    between blue eyes and white fur; and we have already seen that the
    organs of sight and hearing are often simultaneously affected. In
    the present instance the cause probably lies in a slight arrest of
    development in the nervous system in connection with the
    sense-organs. Kittens during the first nine days, whilst their eyes
    are closed, appear to be completely deaf; I have made a great
    clanging noise with a poker and shovel close to their heads, both
    when they were asleep and awake, without producing any effect. The
    trial must not be made by shouting close to their ears, for they
    are, even when asleep, extremely sensitive to a breath of air. Now,
    as long as the eyes continue closed, the iris is no doubt blue, for
    in all the kittens which I have seen this colour remains for some
    time after the eyelids open. Hence, if we suppose the development
    of the organs of sight and hearing to be arrested at the stage of
    the closed eyelids, the eyes would remain permanently blue and the
    ears would be incapable of perceiving sound; and we should thus
    understand this curious case. As, however, the colour of the fur is
    determined long before birth, and as the blueness of the eyes and
    the whiteness of the fur are obviously connected, we must believe
    that some primary cause acts at a much earlier period.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The instances of correlated variability hitherto
    given have been chiefly drawn from the animal kingdom, and we will
    now turn to plants. Leaves, sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils
    are all homologous. In double flowers we see that the stamens and
    pistils vary in the same manner, and assume the form and colour of
    the petals. In the double columbine (<I>Aquilegia vulgaris</I>),
    the successive whorls of stamens are converted into cornucopias,
    which are enclosed within one another and resemble the true petals.
    In hose-in-hose flowers the sepals mock the petals. In some cases
    the flowers and leaves vary together in tint: in all the varieties
    of the common pea, which have purple flowers, a purple mark may be
    seen on the stipules.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">M. Faivre states that with the varieties of <I>
    Primula sinensis</I> the colour of the flower is evidently
    correlated with the colour of the under side of the leaves; and he
    adds that the varieties with fimbriated flowers almost always have
    voluminous, balloon-like calyces.<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
    With other plants the leaves and fruit or seeds vary together in
    colour, as in a curious pale-leaved variety of the sycamore, which
    has recently been described in France,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> and as in the purple-leaved hazel, in
    which the leaves, the husk of the nut, and the pellicle round the
    kernel are all coloured purple.<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
    Pomologists can predict to a certain extent, from the size and
    appearance of the leaves of their seedlings, the probable nature of
    the fruit; for, as Van Mons remarks<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> variations in the leaves are generally
    accompanied by some modification in the flower, and consequently in
    the fruit. In the Serpent melon, which has a narrow tortuous fruit
    above a yard in length, the stem of the plant, the peduncle of the
    female flower, and the middle lobe of the leaf, are all elongated
    in a remarkable manner. On the other hand, several varieties of
    Cucurbita, which have dwarfed stems, all produce, as Naudin
    remarks, leaves of the same peculiar shape. Mr. G. Maw informs me
    that all the varieties of the scarlet Pelargoniums which have
    contracted or imperfect leaves have contracted flowers: the
    difference between "Brilliant" and its parent "Tom Thumb" is a good
    instance of this. It may be suspected that the curious case
    described by Risso,<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> of a variety
    of the Orange which produces on the young shoots rounded leaves
    with winged petioles, and afterwards elongated leaves on long but
    wingless petioles, is connected with the remarkable change in form
    and nature which the fruit undergoes during its development.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the following instance we have the colour and
    the form of the petals apparently correlated, and both dependent on
    the nature of the season. An observer, skilled in the subject,
    writes,<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> "I noticed, during the
    year 1842, that every Dahlia of which the colour had any tendency
    to scarlet, was deeply notched&#8212;indeed, to so great an extent
    as to give the petals the appearance of a saw; the indentures were,
    in some instances, more than a quarter of an inch deep." Again,
    Dahlias which have their petals tipped with a different colour from
    the rest of the flower are very inconstant, and during certain
    years some, or even all the flowers, become uniformly coloured; and
    it has been observed with several varieties<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> that when this happens the petals grow
    much elongated and lose their proper shape. This, however, may be
    due to reversion, both in colour and form, to the aboriginal
    species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In this discussion on correlation, we have
    hitherto treated of cases in which we can partly understand the
    bond of connection; but I will now give cases in which we cannot
    even conjecture, or can only very obscurely see, the nature of the
    bond. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in his work on Monstrosities,
    insists,<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> "que certaines anomalies
    coexistent rarement entr'elles, d'autres fr&#233;quemment, d'autres
    enfin presque constamment, malgr&#233; la diff&#233;rence
    tr&#232;s-grande de leur nature, et quoiqu'elles puissent
    para&#238;tre <I>compl&#232;tement ind&#233;pendantes</I> les unes
    des autres." We see something analogous in certain diseases: thus
    in a rare affection of the renal capsules (of which the functions
    are unknown), the skin becomes bronzed; and in hereditary syphilis,
    as I hear from Sir J. Paget, both the milk and the second teeth
    assume a peculiar and characteristic form. Professor Rolleston,
    also, informs me that the incisor teeth are sometimes furnished
    with a vascular rim in correlation with intra-pulmonary deposition
    of tubercles. In other cases of phthisis and of cyanosis the nails
    and finger-ends become clubbed like acorns. I believe that no
    explanation has been offered of these and of many other cases of
    correlated disease.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">What can be more curious and less intelligible
    than the fact previously given, on the authority of Mr. Tegetmeier,
    that young pigeons of all breeds, which when mature have white,
    yellow, silver-blue, or dun-coloured plumage, come out of the egg
    almost naked; whereas pigeons of other colours when first born are
    clothed with plenty of down? White Pea-fowls, as has been observed
    both in England and France,<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> and
    as I have myself seen, are inferior in size to the common coloured
    kind; and this cannot be accounted for by the belief that albinism
    is always accompanied by constitutional weakness; for white or
    albino moles are generally larger than the common kind.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To turn to more important characters: the niata
    cattle of the Pampas are remarkable from their short foreheads,
    upturned muzzles, and curved lower jaws. In the skull the nasal and
    premaxillary bones are much shortened, the maxillaries are excluded
    from any junction with the nasals, and all the bones are slightly
    modified, even to the plane of the occiput. From the analogous case
    of the dog, hereafter to be given, it is probable that the
    shortening of the nasal and adjoining bones is the proximate cause
    of the other modifications in the skull, including the upward
    curvature of the lower jaw, though we cannot follow out the steps
    by which these changes have been effected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Polish fowls have a large tuft of feathers on
    their heads; and their skulls are perforated by numerous holes, so
    that a pin can be driven into the brain without touching any bone.
    That this deficiency of bone is in some way connected with the tuft
    of feathers is clear from tufted ducks and geese likewise having
    perforated skulls. The case would probably be considered by some
    authors as one of balancement or compensation. In the chapter on
    Fowls, I have shown that with Polish fowls the tuft of feathers was
    probably at first small; by continued selection it became larger,
    and then rested on a fibrous mass; and finally, as it became still
    larger, the skull itself became more and more protuberant until it
    acquired its present extraordinary structure. Through correlation
    with the protuberance of the skull, the shape and even the relative
    connection of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the shape of the
    orifice of the nostrils, the breadth of the frontal bone, the shape
    of the post-lateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones,
    and the direction of the bony cavity of the ear, have all been
    modified. The internal configuration of the skull and the whole
    shape of the brain have likewise been altered in a truly marvellous
    manner.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">After this case of the Polish fowl it would be
    superfluous to do more than refer to the details previously given
    on the manner in which the changed form of the comb has affected
    the skull, in various breeds of the fowl, causing by correlation
    crests, protuberances, and depressions on its surface.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With our cattle and sheep the horns stand in
    close connection with the size of the skull, and with the shape of
    the frontal bones; thus Cline<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
    found that the skull of a horned ram weighed five times as much as
    that of a hornless ram of the same age. When cattle become
    hornless, the frontal bones are "materially diminished in breadth
    towards the poll;" and the cavities between the bony plates "are
    not so deep, nor do they extend beyond the frontals."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> It may be well here to pause and observe
    how the effects of correlated variability, of the increased use of
    parts, and of the accumulation of so-called spontaneous variations
    through natural selection, are in many cases inextricably
    commingled. We may borrow an illustration from Mr. Herbert Spencer,
    who remarks that, when the Irish elk acquired its gigantic horns,
    weighing above one hundred pounds, numerous co-ordinated changes of
    structure would have been indispensable,&#8212;namely, a thickened
    skull to carry the horns; strengthened cervical vertebrae, with
    strengthened ligaments; enlarged dorsal vertebrae to support the
    neck, with powerful fore-legs and feet; all these parts being
    supplied with proper muscles, blood-vessels, and nerves. How then
    could these admirably co-ordinated modifications of structure have
    been acquired? According to the doctrine which I maintain, the
    horns of the male elk were slowly gained through sexual
    selection,&#8212;that is, by the best-armed males conquering the
    worse-armed, and leaving a greater number of descendants. But it is
    not at all necessary that the several parts of the body should have
    simultaneously varied. Each stag presents individual
    characteristics, and in the same district those which had slightly
    heavier horns, or stronger necks, or stronger bodies, or were the
    most courageous, would secure the greater number of does, and
    consequently have a greater number of offspring. The offspring
    would inherit, in a greater or less degree, these same qualities,
    would occasionally intercross with one another, or with other
    individuals varying in some favourable manner; and of their
    offspring, those which were the best endowed in any respect would
    continue multiplying; and so onwards, always progressing, sometimes
    in one direction, and sometimes in another, towards the excellently
    co-ordinated structure of the male elk. To make this clear, let us
    reflect on the probable steps, as shown in the twentieth chapter,
    by which our race and dray horses have arrived at their present
    state of excellence; if we could view the whole series of
    intermediate forms between one of these animals and an early
    unimproved progenitor, we should behold a vast number of animals,
    not equally improved in each generation throughout their entire
    structure, but sometimes a little more in one point, and sometimes
    in another, yet on the whole gradually approaching in character to
    our present race or dray horses, which are so admirably fitted in
    the one case for fleetness and in the other for draught.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although natural selection would thus<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> tend to give to the male elk its present
    structure, yet it is probable that the inherited effects of use,
    and of the mutual action of part on part, have been equally or more
    important. As the horns gradually increased in weight the muscles
    of the neck, with the bones to which they are attached, would
    increase in size and strength; and these parts would react on the
    body and legs. Nor must we overlook the fact that certain parts of
    the skull and the extremities would, judging by analogy, tend from
    the first to vary in a correlated manner. The increased weight of
    the horns would also act directly on the skull, in the same manner
    as when one bone is removed in the leg of a dog, the other bone,
    which has to carry the whole weight of the body, increases in
    thickness. But from the fact given with respect to horned and
    hornless cattle, it is probable that the horns and skull would
    immediately act on each other through the principle of correlation.
    Lastly, the growth and subsequent wear and tear of the augmented
    muscles and bones would require an increased supply of blood, and
    consequently increased supply of food; and this again would require
    increased powers of mastication, digestion, respiration, and
    excretion.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Colour as Correlated with Constitutional Peculiarities.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is an old belief that with man there is a
    connection between complexions and constitution; and I find that
    some of the best authorities believe in this to the present day.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> Thus Dr. Beddoe by his tables
    shows<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> that a relation exists
    between liability to consumption and the colour of the hair, eyes,
    and skin. It has been affirmed<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
    that, in the French army which invaded Russia, soldiers having a
    dark complexion from the southern parts of Europe, withstood the
    intense cold better than those with lighter complexions from the
    north; but no doubt such statements are liable to error.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the second chapter on Selection I have given
    several cases proving that with animals and plants differences in
    colour are correlated with constitutional differences, as shown by
    greater or less immunity from certain diseases, from the attacks of
    parasitic plants and animals, from scorching by the sun, and from
    the action of certain poisons. When all the individuals of any one
    variety possess an immunity of this nature, we do not know that it
    stands in any sort of correlation with their colour; but when
    several similarly coloured varieties of the same species are thus
    characterised, whilst other coloured varieties are not thus
    favoured, we must believe in the existence of a correlation of this
    kind. Thus, in the United States purple-fruited plums of many kinds
    are far more affected by a certain disease than green or
    yellow-fruited varieties. On the other hand, yellow-fleshed peaches
    of various kinds suffer from another disease much more than the
    white-fleshed varieties. In the Mauritius red sugar-canes are much
    less affected by a particular disease than the white canes. White
    onions and verbenas are the most liable to mildew; and in Spain the
    green-fruited grapes suffered from the vine-disease more than other
    coloured varieties. Dark-coloured pelargoniums and verbenas are
    more scorched by the sun than varieties of other colours. Red
    wheats are believed to be hardier than white; and red-flowered
    hyacinths were more injured during one particular winter in Holland
    than other coloured varieties. With animals, white terriers suffer
    most from the distemper, white chickens from a parasitic worm in
    their tracheae, white pigs from scorching by the sun, and white
    cattle from flies; but the caterpillars of the silk-moth which
    yield white cocoons suffered in France less from the deadly
    parasitic fungus than those producing yellow silk.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The cases of immunity from the action of certain
    vegetable poisons, in connexion with colour, are more interesting,
    and are at present wholly inexplicable. I have already given a
    remarkable instance, on the authority of Professor Wyman, of all
    the hogs, excepting those of a black colour, suffering severely in
    Virginia from eating the root of the <I>Lachnanthes tinctoria.</I>
    According to Spinola and others,<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
    buckwheat (<I>Po1ygonum fagopyrum</I>), when in flower, is highly
    injurious to white or white-spotted pigs, if they are exposed to
    the heat of the sun, but is quite innocuous to black pigs.
    According to two accounts, the <I>Hypericum crispum</I> in Sicily
    is poisonous to white sheep alone; their heads swell, their wool
    falls off, and they often die; but this plant, according to Lecce,
    is poisonous only when it grows in swamps; nor is this improbable,
    as we know how readily the poisonous principle in plants is
    influenced by the conditions under which they grow.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Three accounts have been published in Eastern
    Prussia, of white and white-spotted horses being greatly injured by
    eating mildewed and honeydewed vetches; every spot of skin bearing
    white hairs becoming inflamed and gangrenous. The Rev. J. Rodwell
    informs me that his father turned out about fifteen cart-horses
    into a field of tares which in parts swarmed with black aphides,
    and which no doubt were honeydewed, and probably mildewed; the
    horses, with two exceptions, were chestnuts and bays with white
    marks on their faces and pasterns, and the white parts alone
    swelled and became angry scabs. The two bay horses with no white
    marks entirely escaped all injury. In Guernsey, when horses eat
    fool's parsley (<I>&#198;thusa cynapium</I>) they are sometimes
    violently purged; and this plant "has a peculiar effect on the nose
    and lips, causing deep cracks and ulcers, particularly on horses
    with white muzzles."<A href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> With cattle,
    independently of the action of any poison, cases have been
    published by Youatt and Erdt of cutaneous diseases with much
    constitutional disturbance (in one instance after exposure to a hot
    sun) affecting every single point which bore a white hair, but
    completely passing over other parts of the body. Similar cases have
    been observed with horses.<A href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We thus see that not only do those parts of the
    skin which bear white hair differ in a remarkable manner from those
    bearing hair of any other colour, but that some great
    constitutional difference must be correlated with the colour of the
    hair; for in the above-mentioned cases, vegetable poisons caused
    fever, swelling of the head, as well as other symptoms, and even
    death, to all the white, or white-spotted animals.</P>

      informs me that he has bred kittens from a white female with blue
      eyes, which was completely deaf; he has also observed other
      females in the same condition.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">Mr. Herbert Spencer ('Principles of Biology,' 1864, vol. i.
      pp. 452, 468) takes a different view; and in one place remarks:
      "We have seen reason to think that, as fast as essential
      faculties multiply, and as fast as the number of organs that
      co-operate in any given function increases, indirect
      equilibration through natural selection becomes less and less
      capable of producing specific adaptations; and remains fully
      capable only of maintaining the general fitness of constitution
      to conditions." This view that natural selection can do little in
      modifying the higher animals surprises me, seeing that man's
      selection has undoubtedly effected much with our domesticated
      quadrupeds and birds.</FONT></LI>

      ('Die Thierzucht,' 1868, p. 39) says that white or white-spotted
      sheep suffer like pigs, or even die from eating buckwheat; whilst
      black or dark-woolled individuals are not in the least
