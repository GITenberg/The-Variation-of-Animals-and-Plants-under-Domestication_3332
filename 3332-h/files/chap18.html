    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the Good derived from slight Changes in
    the Conditions of Life.</I>&#8212;In considering whether any facts
    were known which might throw light on the conclusion arrived at in
    the last chapter, namely, that benefits ensue from crossing, and
    that it is a law of nature that all organic beings should
    occasionally cross, it appeared to me probable that the good
    derived from slight changes in the conditions of life, from being
    an analogous phenomenon, might serve this purpose. No two
    individuals, and still less no two varieties, are absolutely alike
    in constitution and structure; and when the germ of one is
    fertilised by the male element of another, we may believe that it
    is acted on in a somewhat similar manner as an individual when
    exposed to slightly changed conditions. Now, every one must have
    observed the remarkable influence on convalescents of a change of
    residence, and no medical man doubts the truth of this fact. Small
    farmers who hold but little land are convinced that their cattle
    derive great benefit from a change of pasture. In the case of
    plants, the evidence is strong that a great advantage is derived
    from exchanging seeds, tubers, bulbs, and cuttings from one soil or
    place to another as different as possible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The belief that plants are thus
    benefited, whether or not well founded, has been firmly maintained
    from the time of Columella, who wrote shortly after the Christian
    era, to the present day; and it now prevails in England, France,
    and Germany.<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> A sagacious observer,
    Bradley, writing in 1724,<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> says,
    "When we once become Masters of a good Sort of Seed, we should at
    least put it into Two or Three Hands, where the Soils and
    Situations are as different as possible; and every Year the Parties
    should change with one another; by which Means, I find the Goodness
    of the Seed will be maintained for several Years. For Want of this
    Use many Farmers have failed in their Crops and been great Losers."
    He then gives his own practical experience on this head. A modern
    writer<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> asserts, "Nothing can be
    more clearly established in agriculture than that the continual
    growth of any one variety in the same district makes it liable to
    deterioration either in quality or quantity." Another writer states
    that he sowed close together in the same field two lots of
    wheat-seed, the product of the same original stock, one of which
    had been grown on the same land and the other at a distance, and
    the difference in favour of the crop from the latter seed was
    remarkable. A gentleman in Surrey who has long made it his business
    to raise wheat to sell for seed, and who has constantly realised in
    the market higher prices than others, assures me that he finds it
    indispensable continually to change his seed; and that for this
    purpose he keeps two farms differing much in soil and
    elevation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the tubers of the potato,
    I find that at the present day the practice of exchanging sets is
    almost everywhere followed. The great growers of potatoes in
    Lancashire formerly used to get tubers from Scotland, but they
    found that "a change from the moss-lands, and <I>vice versa,</I>
    was generally sufficient." In former times in France the crop of
    potatoes in the Vosges had become reduced in the course of fifty or
    sixty years in the proportion from 120-150 to 30-40 bushels; and
    the famous Oberlin attributed the surprising good which he effected
    in large part to changing the sets.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>A well-known practical gardener, Mr.
    Robson<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> positively states that he
    has himself witnessed decided advantage from obtaining bulbs of the
    onion, tubers of the potato, and various seeds, all of the same
    kind, from different soils and distant parts of England. He further
    states that with plants propagated by cuttings, as with the
    Pelargonium, and especially the Dahlia, manifest advantage is
    derived from getting plants of the same variety, which have been
    cultivated in another place; or, "where the extent of the place
    allows, to take cuttings from one description of soil to plant on
    another, so as to afford the change that seems so necessary to the
    well-being of the plants." He maintains that after a time an
    exchange of this nature is "forced on the grower, whether he be
    prepared for it or not." Similar remarks have been made by another
    excellent gardener, Mr. Fish, namely, that cuttings of the same
    variety of Calceolaria, which he obtained from a neighbour, "showed
    much greater vigour than some of his own that were "treated in
    exactly the same manner," and he attributed this solely to his own
    plants having become "to a certain extent worn out or tired of
    their quarters." Something of this kind apparently occurs in
    grafting and budding fruit-trees; for, according to Mr. Abbey,
    grafts or buds generally take with greater facility on a distinct
    variety or even species, or on a stock previously grafted, than on
    stocks raised from seeds of the variety which is to be grafted; and
    he believes this cannot be altogether explained by the stocks in
    question being better adapted to the soil and climate of the place.
    It should, however, be added, that varieties grafted or budded on
    very distinct kinds, though they may take more readily and grow at
    first more vigorously than when grafted on closely allied stocks,
    afterwards often become unhealthy.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have studied M. Tessier's careful and
    elaborate experiments<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> made to
    disprove the common belief that good is derived from a change of
    seed; and he certainly shows that the same seed may with care be
    cultivated on the same farm (it is not stated whether on exactly
    the same soil) for ten consecutive years without loss. Another
    excellent observer, Colonel Le Couteur<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> has come to the same conclusion; but then
    he expressly adds, if the same seed be used, "that which is grown
    on land manured from the mixen one year becomes seed for land
    prepared with lime, and that again becomes seed for land dressed
    with ashes, then for land dressed with mixed manure, and so on."
    But this in effect is a systematic exchange of seed, within the
    limits of the same farm.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the whole the belief, which has long been
    held by many cultivators, that good follows from exchanging seed,
    tubers, etc., seems to be fairly well founded. It seems hardly
    credible that the advantage thus derived can be due to the seeds,
    especially if very small ones, obtaining in one soil some chemical
    element deficient in the other and in sufficient quantity to
    influence the whole after-growth of the plant. As plants after once
    germinating are fixed to the same spot, it might have been
    anticipated that they would show the good effects of a change more
    plainly than do animals which continually wander about; and this
    apparently is the case. Life depending on, or consisting in, an
    incessant play of the most complex forces, it would appear that
    their action is in some way stimulated by slight changes in the
    circumstances to which each organism is exposed. All forces
    throughout nature, as Mr. Herbert Spencer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> remarks, tend towards an equilibrium, and
    for the life of each organism it is necessary that this tendency
    should be checked. These views and the foregoing facts probably
    throw light, on the one hand, on the good effects of crossing the
    breed, for the germ will be thus slightly modified or acted on by
    new forces; and on the other hand, on the evil effects of close
    interbreeding prolonged during many generations, during which the
    germ will be acted on by a male having almost identically the same
    constitution.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Sterility from Changed Conditions of Life.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will now attempt to show that animals and
    plants, when removed from their natural conditions, are often
    rendered in some degree infertile or completely barren; and this
    occurs even when the conditions have not been greatly changed. This
    conclusion is not necessarily opposed to that at which we have just
    arrived, namely, that lesser changes of other kinds are
    advantageous to organic beings. Our present subject is of some
    importance, from having an intimate connection with the causes of
    variability. Indirectly it perhaps bears on the sterility of
    species when crossed: for as, on the one hand, slight changes in
    the conditions of life are favourable to plants and animals, and
    the crossing of varieties adds to the size, vigour, and fertility
    of their offspring; so, on the other hand, certain other changes in
    the conditions of life cause sterility; and as this likewise ensues
    from crossing much-modified forms or species, we have a parallel
    and double series of facts, which apparently stand in close
    relation to each other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is notorious that many animals, though
    perfectly tamed, refuse to breed in captivity. Isidore Geoffroy
    St.-Hilaire<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> consequently has drawn
    a broad distinction between tamed animals which will not breed
    under captivity, and truly domesticated animals which breed
    freely&#8212;generally more freely, as shown in the sixteenth
    chapter, than in a state of nature. It is possible and generally
    easy to tame most animals; but experience has shown that it is
    difficult to get them to breed regularly, or even at all. I shall
    discuss this subject in detail; but will give only those cases
    which seem most illustrative. My materials are derived from notices
    scattered through various works, and especially from a Report,
    kindly drawn up for me by the officers of the Zoological Society of
    London, which has especial value, as it records all the cases,
    during nine years from 1838-46, in which the animals were seen to
    couple but produced no offspring, as well as the cases in which
    they never, as far as known, coupled. This MS. Report I have
    corrected by the annual Reports subsequently published up to the
    year 1865.<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Many facts are given
    on the breeding of the animals in that magnificent work, 'Gleanings
    from the Menageries of Knowsley Hall' by Dr. Gray. I made, also,
    particular inquiries from the experienced keeper of the birds in
    the old Surrey Zoological Gardens. I should premise that a slight
    change in the treatment of animals sometimes makes a great
    difference in their fertility; and it is probable that the results
    observed in different menageries would differ. Indeed, some animals
    in our Zoological Gardens have become more productive since the
    year 1846. It is, also, manifest from F. Cuvier's account of the
    Jardin des Plantes<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> that the
    animals formerly bred much less freely there than with us; for
    instance, in the Duck tribe, which is highly prolific, only one
    species had at that period produced young.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The most remarkable cases, however, are
    afforded by animals kept in their native country, which, though
    perfectly tamed, quite healthy, and allowed some freedom, are
    absolutely incapable of breeding. Rengger,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> who in Paraguay particularly attended to
    this subject, specifies six quadrupeds in this condition; and he
    mentions two or three others which most rarely breed. Mr. Bates, in
    his admirable work on the Amazons, strongly insists on similar
    cases;<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> and he remarks, that the
    fact of thoroughly tamed native mammals and birds not breeding when
    kept by the Indians, cannot be wholly accounted for by their
    negligence or indifference, for the turkey and fowl are kept and
    bred by various remote tribes. In almost every part of the
    world&#8212;for instance, in the interior of Africa, and in several
    of the Polynesian islands&#8212;the natives are extremely fond of
    taming the indigenous quadrupeds and birds; but they rarely or
    never succeed in getting them to breed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The most notorious case of an animal not
    breeding in captivity is that of the elephant. Elephants are kept
    in large numbers in their native Indian home, live to old age, and
    are vigorous enough for the severest labour; yet, with a very few
    exceptions, they have never been known even to couple, though both
    males and females have their proper periodical seasons. If,
    however, we proceed a little eastward to Ava, we hear from Mr.
    Crawfurd<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> that their "breeding in
    the domestic state, or at least in the half-domestic state in which
    the female elephants are generally kept, is of everyday
    occurrence;" and Mr. Crawfurd informs me that he believes that the
    difference must be attributed solely to the females being allowed
    to roam the forest with some degree of freedom. The captive
    rhinoceros, on the other hand, seems from Bishop Heber's account<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> to breed in India far more readily
    than the elephant. Four wild species of the horse genus have bred
    in Europe, though here exposed to a great change in their natural
    habits of life; but the species have generally been crossed one
    with another. Most of the members of the pig family breed readily
    in our menageries; even the Red River hog (<I>Potamoch&#339;rus
    penicillatus</I>), from the sweltering plains of West Africa, has
    bred twice in the Zoological Gardens. Here also the Peccary
    (<I>Dicotyles torquatus</I>) has bred several times; but another
    species, the <I>D. labiatus,</I> though rendered so tame as to be
    half-domesticated, is said to breed so rarely in its native country
    of Paraguay, that according to Rengger<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> the fact requires confirmation. Mr.
    Bates remarks that the tapir, though often kept tame in Amazonia by
    the Indians, never breeds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Ruminants generally breed quite freely in
    England, though brought from widely different climates, as may be
    seen in the Annual Reports of the Zoological Gardens, and in the
    Gleanings from Lord Derby's menagerie.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The Carnivora, with the exception of the
    Plantigrade division, breed (though with capricious exceptions)
    about half as freely as ruminants. Many species of Felidae have
    bred in various menageries, although imported from diverse climates
    and closely confined. Mr. Bartlett, the present superintendent of
    the Zoological Gardens<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> remarks
    that the lion appears to breed more frequently and to bring forth
    more young at a birth than any other species of the family. He adds
    that the tiger has rarely bred; "but there are several
    well-authenticated instances of the female tiger breeding with the
    lion." Strange as the fact may appear, many animals under
    confinement unite with distinct species and produce hybrids quite
    as freely as, or even more freely than, with their own species. On
    inquiring from Dr. Falconer and others, it appears that the tiger
    when confined in India does not breed, though it has been known to
    couple. The chetah (<I>Felis jubata</I>) has never been known by
    Mr. Bartlett to breed in England, but it has bred at Frankfort; nor
    does it breed in India, where it is kept in large numbers for
    hunting; but no pains would be taken to make them breed, as only
    those animals which have hunted for themselves in a state of nature
    are serviceable and worth training.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> According to Rengger, two species of
    wild cats in Paraguay, though thoroughly tamed, have never bred.
    Although so many of the Felidae breed readily in the Zoological
    Gardens, yet conception by no means always follows union: in the
    nine-year Report, various species are specified which were observed
    to couple seventy-three times, and no doubt this must have passed
    many times unnoticed; yet from the seventy- three unions only
    fifteen births ensued. The Carnivora in the Zoological Gardens were
    formerly less freely exposed to the air and cold than at present,
    and this change of treatment, as I was assured by the former
    superintendent, Mr. Miller, greatly increased their fertility. Mr.
    Bartlett, and there cannot be a more capable judge, says, "it is
    remarkable that lions breed more freely in travelling collections
    than in the Zoological Gardens; probably the constant excitement
    and irritation produced by moving from place to place, or change of
    air, may have considerable influence in the matter."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Many members of the Dog family breed
    readily when confined. The Dhole is one of the most untamable
    animals in India, yet a pair kept there by Dr. Falconer produced
    young. Foxes, on the other hand, rarely breed, and I have never
    heard of such an occurrence with the European fox: the silver fox
    of North America (<I>Canis argentatus</I>), however, has bred
    several times in the Zoological Gardens. Even the otter has bred
    there. Every one knows how readily the semi-domesticated ferret
    breeds, though shut up in miserably small cages; but other species
    of Viverra and Paradoxurus absolutely refuse to breed in the
    Zoological Gardens. The Genetta has bred both here and in the
    Jardin des Plantes, and produced hybrids. The <I>Herpestes
    fasciatus</I> has likewise bred; but I was formerly assured that
    the <I>H. griseus,</I> though many were kept in the Gardens, never
    bred.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The Plantigrade Carnivora breed under
    confinement much less freely than other Carnivora, although no
    reason can be assigned for this fact. In the nine-year Report it is
    stated that the bears had been seen in the Zoological Gardens to
    couple freely, but previously to 1848 had most rarely conceived. In
    the Reports published since this date three species have produced
    young (hybrids in one case), and, wonderful to relate, the white
    Polar bear has produced young. The badger (<I>Meles taxus</I>) has
    bred several times in the Gardens; but I have not heard of this
    occurring elsewhere in England, and the event must be very rare,
    for an instance in Germany has been thought worth recording.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> In Paraguay the native Nasua,
    though kept in pairs during many years and perfectly tamed, has
    never been known, according to Rengger, to breed or show any sexual
    passion; nor, as I hear from Mr. Bates, does this animal, or the
    Cercoleptes, breed in Amazonia. Two other plantigrade genera,
    Procyon and Gulo, though often kept tame in Paraguay, never breed
    there. In the Zoological Gardens species of Nasua and Procyon have
    been seen to couple; but they did not produce young.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As domesticated rabbits, guinea-pigs, and
    white mice breed so abundantly when closely confined under various
    climates, it might have been thought that most other members of the
    Rodent order would have bred in captivity, but this is not the
    case. It deserves notice, as showing how the capacity to breed
    sometimes goes by affinity, that the one native rodent of Paraguay,
    which there breeds <I>freely</I> and has yielded successive
    generations, is the <I>Cavia aperea</I>; and this animal is so
    closely allied to the guinea-pig, that it has been erroneously
    thought to be the parent form.<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> In
    the Zoological Gardens, some rodents have coupled, but have never
    produced young; some have neither coupled nor bred; but a few have
    bred, as the porcupine more than once, the Barbary mouse, lemming,
    chinchilla, and agouti (<I>Dasyprocta aguti</I>) several times.
    This latter animal has also produced young in Paraguay, though they
    were born dead and ill-formed; but in Amazonia, according to Mr.
    Bates, it never breeds, though often kept tame about the houses.
    Nor does the paca (<I>C&#339;logenys paca</I>) breed there. The
    common hare when confined has, I believe, never bred in Europe;
    though, according to a recent statement, it has crossed with the
    rabbit.<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> I have never heard of the
    dormouse breeding in confinement. But squirrels offer a more
    curious case: with one exception, no species has bred in the
    Zoological Gardens, yet as many as fourteen individuals of <I>S.
    palmarum</I> were kept together during several years. The <I>S.
    cinera</I> has been seen to couple, but it did not produce young;
    nor has this species, when rendered extremely tame in its native
    country, North America, been ever known to breed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> At Lord Derby's menagerie squirrels of
    many kinds were kept in numbers, but Mr. Thompson, the
    superintendent, told me that none had ever bred there, or elsewhere
    as far as he knew. I have never heard of the English squirrel
    breeding in confinement. But the species which has bred more than
    once in the Zoological Gardens is the one which perhaps might have
    been least expected, namely, the flying squirrel (<I>Sciuropterus
    volucella</I>): it has, also, bred several times near Birmingham;
    but the female never produced more than two young at a birth,
    whereas in its native American home she bears from three to six
    young.<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Monkeys, in the nine-year Report from the
    Zoological Gardens, are stated to unite most freely, but during
    this period, though many individuals were kept, there were only
    seven births. I have heard of only one American monkey, the
    Ouistiti, breeding in Europe.<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> A
    Macacus, according to Flourens, bred in Paris; and more than one
    species of this genus has produced young in London, especially the
    <I>Macacus rhesus,</I> which everywhere shows a special capacity to
    breed under confinement. Hybrids have been produced both in Paris
    and London from this same genus. The Arabian baboon, or <I>
    Cynocephalus hamadryas,</I><A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> and a
    Cercopithecus have bred in the Zoological Gardens, and the latter
    species at the Duke of Northumberland's. Several members of the
    family of Lemurs have produced hybrids in the Zoological Gardens.
    It is much more remarkable that monkeys very rarely breed when
    confined in their native country; thus the Cay (<I>Cebus
    azar&#230;</I>) is frequently and completely tamed in Paraguay, but
    Rengger<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> says that it breeds so
    rarely, that he never saw more than two females which had produced
    young. A similar observation has been made with respect to the
    monkeys which are frequently tamed by the aborigines in Brazil.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> In Amazonia, these animals are so
    often kept in a tame state, that Mr. Bates in walking through the
    streets of Para counted thirteen species; but, as he asserts, they
    have never been known to breed in captivity.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Birds offer in some respects better

    will hatch the eggs of fowls or pigeons. In the Zoological Gardens

    with the exception of three species of parakeets, none have bred.
    It is a much more remarkable fact that in Guiana parrots of two
    kinds, as I am informed by Sir R. Schomburgk, are often taken from
    the nests by the Indians and reared in large numbers; they are so
    tame that they fly freely about the houses, and come when called to

    probably too bold. The capacity to breed sometimes varies in
    individuals of the same species; thus Audubon<A href=

    geese (<I>Anser canadensis</I>), but they would not mate; whilst
    other individuals of the same species produced young during the
    second year. I know of but one instance in the whole family of a

    <I>Dendrocygna viduata,</I> although, according to Sir R.
    Schomburgk,<A href="#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> it is easily tamed,
    and is frequently kept by the Indians of Guiana. Lastly, with
    respect to Gulls, though many have been kept in the Zoological
    Gardens and in the old Surrey Gardens, no instance was known before
    the year 1848 of their coupling or breeding; but since that period
    the herring gull (<I>Larus argentatus</I>) has bred many times in
    the Zoological Gardens and at Knowsley.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>There is reason to believe that insects
    are affected by confinement like the higher animals. It is well
    known that the Sphingidae rarely breed when thus treated. An
    entomologist<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> in Paris kept
    twenty-five specimens of <I>Saturnia pyri,</I> but did not succeed
    in getting a single fertile egg. A number of females of <I>Orthosia
    munda</I> and of <I>Mamestra suasa</I> reared in confinement were
    unattractive to the males.<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> Mr.
    Newport kept nearly a hundred individuals of two species of
    Vanessa, but not one paired; this, however, might have been due to
    their habit of coupling on the wing.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> Mr. Atkinson could never succeed in
    India in making the Tarroo silk-moth breed in confinement.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> It appears that a number of moths,
    especially the Sphingidae, when hatched in the autumn out of their
    proper season, are completely barren; but this latter case is still
    involved in some obscurity.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Independently of the fact of many animals under
    confinement not coupling, or, if they couple, not producing young,
    there is evidence of another kind that their sexual functions are
    disturbed. For many cases have been recorded of the loss by male
    birds when confined of their characteristic plumage. Thus the
    common linnet (<I>Linota cannabina</I>) when caged does not acquire
    the fine crimson colour on its breast, and one of the buntings
    (<I>Emberiza passerina</I>) loses the black on its head. A Pyrrhula
    and an Oriolus have been observed to assume the quiet plumage of
    the hen-bird; and the <I>Falco albidus</I> returned to the dress of
    an earlier age.<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> Mr. Thompson, the
    superintendent of the Knowsley menagerie, informed me that he had
    often observed analogous facts. The horns of a male deer (<I>Cervus
    canadensis</I>) during the voyage from America were badly
    developed; but subsequently in Paris perfect horns were
    produced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When conception takes place under confinement,
    the young are often born dead, or die soon, or are ill-formed. This
    frequently occurs in the Zoological Gardens, and, according to
    Rengger, with native animals confined in Paraguay. The mother's
    milk often fails. We may also attribute to the disturbance of the
    sexual functions the frequent occurrence of that monstrous instinct
    which leads the mother to devour her own offspring,&#8212;a
    mysterious case of perversion, as it at first appears.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Sufficient evidence has now been advanced to
    prove that animals when first confined are eminently liable to
    suffer in their reproductive systems. We feel at first naturally
    inclined to attribute the result to loss of health, or at least to
    loss of vigour; but this view can hardly be admitted when we
    reflect how healthy, long-lived, and vigorous many animals are
    under captivity, such as parrots, and hawks when used for hawking,
    cheetahs when used for hunting, and elephants. The reproductive
    organs themselves are not diseased; and the diseases, from which
    animals in menageries usually perish, are not those which in any
    way affect their fertility. No domestic animal is more subject to
    disease than the sheep, yet it is remarkably prolific. The failure
    of animals to breed under confinement has been sometimes attributed
    exclusively to a failure in their sexual instincts: this may
    occasionally come into play, but there is no obvious reason why
    this instinct should be especially liable to be affected with
    perfectly tamed animals, except, indeed, indirectly through the
    reproductive system itself being disturbed. Moreover, numerous
    cases have been given of various animals which couple freely under
    confinement, but never conceive; or, if they conceive and produce
    young, these are fewer in number than is natural to the species. In
    the vegetable kingdom instinct of course can play no part; and we
    shall presently see that plants when removed from their natural
    conditions are affected in nearly the same manner as animals.
    Change of climate cannot be the cause of the loss of fertility,
    for, whilst many animals imported into Europe from extremely
    different climates breed freely, many others when confined in their
    native land are completely sterile. Change of food cannot be the
    chief cause; for ostriches, ducks, and many other animals, which
    must have undergone a great change in this respect, breed freely.
    Carnivorous birds when confined are extremely sterile, whilst most
    carnivorous mammals, except plantigrades, are moderately fertile.
    Nor can the amount of food be the cause; for a sufficient supply
    will certainly be given to valuable animals; and there is no reason
    to suppose that much more food would be given to them than to our
    choice domestic productions which retain their full fertility.
    Lastly, we may infer from the case of the elephant, cheetah,
    various hawks, and of many animals which are allowed to lead an
    almost free life in their native land, that want of exercise is not
    the sole cause.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It would appear that any change in the habits of
    life, whatever these habits may be, if great enough, tends to
    affect in an inexplicable manner the powers of reproduction. The
    result depends more on the constitution of the species than on the
    nature of the change; for certain whole groups are affected more
    than others; but exceptions always occur, for some species in the
    most fertile groups refuse to breed, and some in the most sterile
    groups breed freely. Those animals which usually breed freely under
    confinement, rarely breed, as I was assured, in the Zoological
    Gardens, within a year or two after their first importation. When
    an animal which is generally sterile under confinement happens to
    breed, the young apparently do not inherit this power: for had this
    been the case, various quadrupeds and birds, which are valuable for
    exhibition, would have become common. Dr. Broca even affirms<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> that many animals in the Jardin des
    Plantes, after having produced young for three or four successive
    generations, become sterile; but this may be the result of too
    close interbreeding. It is a remarkable circumstance that many
    mammals and birds have produced hybrids under confinement quite as
    readily as, or even more readily than, they have procreated their
    own kind. Of this fact many instances have been given;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> and we are thus reminded of those plants
    which when cultivated refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen,
    but can easily be fertilised by that of a distinct species.
    Finally, we must conclude, limited as the conclusion is, that
    changed conditions of life have an especial power of acting
    injuriously on the reproductive system. The whole case is quite
    peculiar, for these organs, though not diseased, are thus rendered
    incapable of performing their proper functions, or perform them
    imperfectly.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sterility of Domesticated Animals from
    changed conditions.</I>&#8212;With respect to domesticated animals,
    as their domestication mainly depends on the accident of their
    breeding freely under captivity, we ought not to expect that their
    reproductive system would be affected by any moderate degree of
    change. Those orders of quadrupeds and birds, of which the wild
    species breed most readily in our menageries, have afforded us the
    greatest number of domesticated productions. Savages in most parts
    of the world are fond of taming animals;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> and if any of these regularly produced
    young, and were at the same time useful, they would be at once
    domesticated. If, when their masters migrated into other countries,
    they were in addition found capable of withstanding various
    climates, they would be still more valuable; and it appears that
    the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally
    withstand different climates. Some few domesticated animals, such
    as the reindeer and camel, offer an exception to this rule. Many of
    our domesticated animals can bear with undiminished fertility the
    most unnatural conditions; for instance, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and
    ferrets breed in miserably confined hutches. Few European dogs of
    any kind withstand the climate of India without degenerating, but
    as long as they survive, they retain, as I hear from Dr. Falconer,
    their fertility; so it is, according to Dr. Daniell, with English
    dogs taken to Sierra Leone. The fowl, a native of the hot jungles
    of India, becomes more fertile than its parent-stock in every
    quarter of the world, until we advance as far north as Greenland
    and Northern Siberia, where this bird will not breed. Both fowls
    and pigeons, which I received during the autumn direct from Sierra
    Leone, were at once ready to couple.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> I have, also, seen pigeons breeding as
    freely as the common kinds within a year after their importation
    from the upper Nile. The guinea- fowl, an aboriginal of the hot and
    dry deserts of Africa, whilst living under our damp and cool
    climate, produces a large supply of eggs.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Nevertheless, our domesticated animals
    under new conditions occasionally show signs of lessened fertility.
    Roulin asserts that in the hot valleys of the equatorial Cordillera
    sheep are not fully fecund;<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> and
    according to Lord Somerville<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> the
    merino-sheep which he imported from Spain were not at first
    perfectly fertile, it is said<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A>
    that mares brought up on dry food in the stable, and turned out to
    grass, do not at first breed. The peahen, as we have seen, is said
    not to lay so many eggs in England as in India. It was long before
    the canary-bird was fully fertile, and even now first-rate breeding
    birds are not common.<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> In the hot
    and dry province of Delhi, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, the eggs of
    the turkey, though placed under a hen, are extremely liable to
    fail. According to Roulin, geese taken to the lofty plateau of
    Bogota, at first laid seldom, and then only a few eggs; of these
    scarcely a fourth were hatched, and half the young birds died; in
    the second generation they were more fertile; and when Roulin wrote
    they were becoming as fertile as our geese in Europe. With respect
    to the valley of Quito, Mr. Orton says<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> "the only geese in the valley are a few
    imported from Europe, and these refuse to propagate." In the
    Philippine Archipelago the goose, it is asserted, will not breed or
    even lay eggs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> A more curious
    case is that of the fowl, which, according to Roulin, when first
    introduced would not breed at Cusco in Bolivia, but subsequently
    became quite fertile; and the English Game fowl, lately introduced,
    had not as yet arrived at its full fertility, for to raise two or
    three chickens from a nest of eggs was thought fortunate. In Europe
    close confinement has a marked effect on the fertility of the fowl:
    it has been found in France that with fowls allowed considerable
    freedom only twenty per cent of the eggs failed; when allowed less
    freedom forty per cent failed; and in close confinement sixty out
    of the hundred were not hatched.<A href="#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A>
    So we see that unnatural and changed conditions of life produce
    some effect on the fertility of our most thoroughly domesticated
    animals, in the same manner, though in a far less degree, as with
    captive wild animals.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is by no means rare to find certain
    males and females which will not breed together, though both are
    known to be perfectly fertile with other males and females. We have
    no reason to suppose that this is caused by these animals having
    been subjected to any change in their habits of life; therefore
    such cases are hardly related to our present subject. The cause
    apparently lies in an innate sexual incompatibility of the pair
    which are matched. Several instances have been communicated to me
    by Mr. W. C. Spooner (well known for his essay on Cross-breeding),
    by Mr. Eyton of Eyton, by Mr. Wicksted and other breeders, and
    especially by Mr. Waring of Chelsfield, in relation to horses,
    cattle, pigs, foxhounds, other dogs, and pigeons.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> In these cases, females, which either
    previously or subsequently were proved to be fertile, failed to
    breed with certain males, with whom it was particularly desired to
    match them. A change in the constitution of the female may
    sometimes have occurred before she was put to the second male; but
    in other cases this explanation is hardly tenable, for a female,
    known not to be barren, has been unsuccessfully paired seven or
    eight times with the same male likewise known to be perfectly
    fertile. With cart-mares, which sometimes will not breed with
    stallions of pure blood, but subsequently have bred with
    cart-stallions, Mr. Spooner is inclined to attribute the failure to
    the lesser sexual power of the racehorse. But I have heard from the
    greatest breeder of racehorses at the present day, through Mr.
    Waring, that "it frequently occurs with a mare to be put several
    times during one or two seasons to a particular stallion of
    acknowledged power, and yet prove barren; the mare afterwards
    breeding at once with some other horse." These facts are worth
    recording, as they show, like so many previous facts, on what
    slight constitutional differences the fertility of an animal often
    depends.</SMALL></P>

    frequently occur, analogous with those previously given in the
    animal kingdom. But the subject is obscured by several
    circumstances, presently to be discussed, namely, the contabescence
    of the anthers, as G&#228;rtner has named a certain
    affection&#8212;monstrosities&#8212;doubleness of the
    flower&#8212;much-enlarged fruit&#8212;and long-continued or
    excessive propagation by buds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is notorious that many plants in our
    gardens and hot-houses, though preserved in the most perfect
    health, rarely or never produce seed. I do not allude to plants
    which run to leaves, from being kept too damp, or too warm, or too
    much manured; for these do not flower, and the case may be wholly
    different. Nor do I allude to fruit not ripening from want of heat
    or rotting from too much moisture. But many exotic plants, with
    their ovules and pollen appearing perfectly sound, will not set any
    seed. The sterility in many cases, as I know from my own
    observation, is simply due to the absence of the proper insects for
    carrying the pollen to the stigma. But after excluding the several
    cases just specified, there are many plants in which the
    reproductive system has been seriously affected by the altered
    conditions of life to which they have been subjected.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It would be tedious to enter on many
    details. Linn&#230;us long ago observed<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A> that Alpine plants, although naturally
    loaded with seed, produce either few or none when cultivated in
    gardens. But exceptions often occur: the <I>Draba sylvestris,</I>
    one of our most thoroughly Alpine plants, multiplies itself by seed
    in Mr. H. C. Watson's garden, near London; and Kerner, who has
    particularly attended to the cultivation of Alpine plants, found
    that various kinds, when cultivated, spontaneously sowed
    themselves.<A href="#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> Many plants which
    naturally grow in peat-earth are entirely sterile in our gardens. I
    have noticed the same fact with several liliaceous plants, which
    nevertheless grew vigorously.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Too much manure renders some kinds
    utterly sterile, as I have myself observed. The tendency to
    sterility from this cause runs in families; thus, according to
    G&#228;rtner,<A href="#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> it is hardly
    possible to give too much manure to most Gramine&#230;,
    Crucifer&#230;, and Leguminos&#230;, whilst succulent and
    bulbous-rooted plants are easily affected. Extreme poverty of soil
    is less apt to induce sterility; but dwarfed plants of <I>Trifolium
    minus</I> and <I>repens,</I> growing on a lawn often mown and never
    manured, were found by me not to produce any seed. The temperature
    of the soil, and the season at which plants are watered, often have
    a marked effect on their fertility, as was observed by
    K&#246;lreuter in the case of Mirabilis.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> Mr. Scott, in the Botanic Gardens of
    Edinburgh, observed that <I>Oncidium divaricatum</I> would not set
    seed when grown in a basket in which it throve, but was capable of
    fertilisation in a pot where it was a little damper. <I>Pelargonium
    fulgidum,</I> for many years after its introduction, seeded freely;
    it then became sterile; now it is fertile<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> if kept in a dry stove during the
    winter. Other varieties of pelargonium are sterile and others
    fertile without our being able to assign any cause. Very slight
    changes in the position of a plant, whether planted on a bank or at
    its base, sometimes make all the difference in its producing seed.
    Temperature apparently has a much more powerful influence on the
    fertility of plants than on that of animals. Nevertheless it is
    wonderful what changes some few plants will withstand with
    undiminished fertility: thus the <I>Zephyranthes candida,</I> a
    native of the moderately warm banks of the Plata, sows itself in
    the hot dry country near Lima, and in Yorkshire resists the
    severest frosts, and I have seen seeds gathered from pods which had
    been covered with snow during three weeks.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> <I>Berberis wallichii,</I> from the hot
    Khasia range in India, is uninjured by our sharpest frosts, and
    ripens its fruit under our cool summers. Nevertheless, I presume we
    must attribute to change of climate the sterility of many foreign
    plants; thus, the Persian and Chinese lilacs (<I>Syringa
    persica</I> and <I>chinensis</I>), though perfectly hardy here,
    never produce a seed; the common lilac (<I>S. vulgaris</I>) seeds
    with us moderately well, but in parts of Germany the capsules never
    contain seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> Some few of the
    cases, given in the last chapter, of self-impotent plants, might
    have been here introduced, as their state seems due to the
    conditions to which they have been subjected.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The liability of plants to be affected in
    their fertility by slightly changed conditions is the more
    remarkable, as the pollen when once in process of formation is not
    easily injured; a plant may be transplanted, or a branch with
    flower-buds be cut off and placed in water, and the pollen will be
    matured. Pollen, also, when once mature, may be kept for weeks or
    even months.<A href="#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> The female organs
    are more sensitive, for G&#228;rtner<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> found that dicotyledonous plants, when
    carefully removed so that they did not in the least flag, could
    seldom be fertilised; this occurred even with potted plants if the
    roots had grown out of the hole at the bottom. In some few cases,
    however, as with Digitalis, transplantation did not prevent
    fertilisation; and according to the testimony of Mawz, <I>Brassica
    rapa,</I> when pulled up by its roots and placed in water, ripened
    its seed. Flower-stems of several monocotyledonous plants when cut
    off and placed in water likewise produce seed. But in these cases I
    presume that the flowers had been already fertilised, for Herbert<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A> found with the Crocus that the
    plants might be removed or mutilated after the act of
    fertilisation, and would still perfect their seeds; but that, if
    transplanted before being fertilised, the application of pollen was
    powerless.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Plants which have been long cultivated
    can generally endure with undiminished fertility various and great
    changes; but not in most cases so great a change of climate as
    domesticated animals. It is remarkable that many plants under these
    circumstances are so much affected that the proportion and the
    nature of their chemical ingredients are modified, yet their
    fertility is unimpaired. Thus, as Dr. Falconer informs me, there is
    a great difference in the character of the fibre in hemp, in the
    quantity of oil in the seed of the Linum, in the proportion of
    narcotin to morphine in the poppy, in gluten to starch in wheat,
    when these plants are cultivated on the plains and on the mountains
    of India; nevertheless, they all remain fully fertile.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Contabescence.</I>&#8212;G&#228;rtner
    has designated by this term a peculiar condition of the anthers in
    certain plants, in which they are shrivelled, or become brown and
    tough, and contain no good pollen. When in this state they exactly
    resemble the anthers of the most sterile hybrids. G&#228;rtner,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A> in his discussion on this subject,
    has shown that plants of many orders are occasionally thus
    affected; but the Caryophyllace&#230; and Liliace&#230; suffer
    most, and to these orders, I think, the Ericace&#230; may be added.
    Contabescence varies in degree, but on the same plant all the
    flowers are generally affected to nearly the same extent. The
    anthers are affected at a very early period in the flower-bud, and
    remain in the same state (with one recorded exception) during the
    life of the plant. The affection cannot be cured by any change of
    treatment, and is propagated by layers, cuttings, etc., and perhaps
    even by seed. In contabescent plants the female organs are seldom
    affected, or merely become precocious in their development. The
    cause of this affection is doubtful, and is different in different
    cases. Until I read G&#228;rtner's discussion I attributed it, as
    apparently did Herbert, to the unnatural treatment of the plants;
    but its permanence under changed conditions, and the female organs
    not being affected, seem incompatible with this view. The fact of
    several endemic plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems,
    at first sight, equally incompatible with this view; but
    K&#246;lreuter believes that this is the result of their
    transplantation. The contabescent plants of Dianthus and Verbascum,
    found wild by Wiegmann, grew on a dry and sterile bank. The fact
    that exotic plants are eminently liable to this affection also
    seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their unnatural
    treatment. In some instances, as with Silene, G&#228;rtner's view
    seems the most probable, namely, that it is caused by an inherent
    tendency in the species to become dioecious. I can add another
    cause, namely, the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants, for
    I have observed seedlings of three species of Primula and of <I>
    Lythrum salicaria,</I> which had been raised from plants
    illegitimately fertilised by their own-form pollen, with some or
    all their anthers in a contabescent state. There is perhaps an
    additional cause, namely, self-fertilisation; for many plants of
    Dianthus and Lobelia, which had been raised from self-fertilised
    seeds, had their anthers in this state; but these instances are not
    conclusive, as both genera are liable from other causes to this
    affection.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Cases of an opposite nature likewise
    occur, namely, plants with the female organs struck with sterility,
    whilst the male organs remain perfect. <I>Dianthus japonicus,</I> a
    Passiflora, and Nicotiana, have been described by G&#228;rtner<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> as being in this unusual
    condition.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Monstrosities as a cause of
    sterility.</I>&#8212;Great deviations of structure, even when the
    reproductive organs themselves are not seriously affected,
    sometimes cause plants to become sterile. But in other cases plants
    may become monstrous to an extreme degree and yet retain their full
    fertility. Gallesio, who certainly had great experience,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>90</SUP></A> often attributes sterility to this
    cause; but it may be suspected that in some of his cases sterility
    was the cause, and not the result, of the monstrous growths. The
    curious St. Valery apple, although it bears fruit, rarely produces
    seed. The wonderfully anomalous flowers of <I>Begonia frigida,</I>
    formerly described, though they appear fit for fructification, are
    sterile.<A href="#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> Species of Primula in
    which the calyx is brightly coloured are said<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> to be often sterile, though I have known
    them to be fertile. On the other hand, Verlot gives several cases
    of proliferous flowers which can be propagated by seed. This was
    the case with a poppy, which had become monopetalous by the union
    of its petals.<A href="#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A> Another
    extraordinary poppy, with the stamens replaced by numerous small
    supplementary capsules, likewise reproduces itself by seed. This
    has also occurred with a plant of <I>Saxifraga geum,</I> in which a
    series of adventitious carpels, bearing ovules on their margins,
    had been developed between the stamens and the normal carpels<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>94</SUP></A> Lastly, with respect to peloric
    flowers, which depart wonderfully from the natural
    structure,&#8212;those of <I>Linaria vulgaris</I> seem generally to
    be more or less sterile, whilst those before described of <I>
    Antirrhinum majus,</I> when artificially fertilised with their own
    pollen, are perfectly fertile, though sterile when left to
    themselves, for bees are unable to crawl into the narrow tubular
    flower. The peloric flowers of <I>Corydalis solida,</I> according
    to Godron,<A href="#refer"><SUP>95</SUP></A> are sometimes barren
    and sometimes fertile; whilst those of Gloxinia are well known to
    yield plenty of seed. In our greenhouse Pelargoniums, the central
    flower of the truss is often peloric, and Mr. Masters informs me
    that he tried in vain during several years to get seed from these
    flowers. I likewise made many vain attempts, but sometimes
    succeeded in fertilising them with pollen from a normal flower of
    another variety; and conversely I several times fertilised ordinary
    flowers with peloric pollen. Only once I succeeded in raising a
    plant from a peloric flower fertilised by pollen from a peloric
    flower borne by another variety; but the plant, it may be added,
    presented nothing particular in its structure. Hence we may
    conclude that no general rule can be laid down; but any great
    deviation from the normal structure, even when the reproductive
    organs themselves are not seriously affected, certainly often leads
    to sexual impotence.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Double Flowers.</I>&#8212;When the
    stamens are converted into petals, the plant becomes on the male
    side sterile; when both stamens and pistils are thus changed, the
    plant becomes completely barren. Symmetrical flowers having
    numerous stamens and petals are the most liable to become double,
    as perhaps follows from all multiple organs being the most subject
    to variability. But flowers furnished with only a few stamens, and
    others which are asymmetrical in structure, sometimes become
    double, as we see with the double gorse or Ulex, and Antirrhinum.
    The Composit&#230; bear what are called double flowers by the
    abnormal development of the corolla of their central florets.
    Doubleness is sometimes connected with prolification,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>96</SUP></A> or the continued growth of the axis of
    the flower. Doubleness is strongly inherited. No one has produced,
    as Lindley remarks,<A href="#refer"><SUP>97</SUP></A> double
    flowers by promoting the perfect health of the plant. On the
    contrary, unnatural conditions of life favour their production.
    There is some reason to believe that seeds kept during many years,
    and seeds believed to be imperfectly fertilised, yield double
    flowers more freely than fresh and perfectly fertilised seed.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>98</SUP></A> Long-continued cultivation in rich
    soil seems to be the commonest exciting cause. A double narcissus
    and a double <I>Anthemis nobilis,</I> transplanted into very poor
    soil, has been observed to become single;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>99</SUP></A> and I have seen a completely double
    white primrose rendered permanently single by being divided and
    transplanted whilst in full flower. It has been observed by
    Professor E. Morren that doubleness of the flowers and variegation
    of the leaves are antagonistic states; but so many exceptions to
    the rule have lately been recorded,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>100</SUP></A> that, though general, it cannot be
    looked at as invariable. Variegation seems generally to result from
    a feeble or atrophied condition of the plant, and a large
    proportion of the seedlings raised from parents, if both are
    variegated, usually perish at an early age; hence we may perhaps
    infer that doubleness, which is the antagonistic state, commonly
    arises from a plethoric condition. On the other hand, extremely
    poor soil sometimes, though rarely, appears to cause doubleness: I
    formerly described<A href="#refer"><SUP>101</SUP></A> some
    completely double, bud-like, flowers produced in large numbers by
    stunted wild plants of <I>Gentiana amarella</I> growing on a poor
    chalky bank. I have also noticed a distinct tendency to doubleness
    in the flowers of a Ranunculus, Horse-chestnut, and Bladder-nut
    (<I>Ranunculus repens, Aesculus pavia,</I> and <I>Staphylea</I>),
    growing under very unfavourable conditions. Professor Lehmann<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>102</SUP></A> found several wild plants growing
    near a hot spring with double flowers. With respect to the cause of
    doubleness, which arises, as we see, under widely different
    circumstances, I shall presently attempt to show that the most
    probable view is that unnatural conditions first give a tendency to
    sterility, and that then, on the principle of compensation, as the
    reproductive organs do not perform their proper functions, they
    either become developed into petals, or additional petals are
    formed. This view has lately been supported by Mr. Laxton<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>103</SUP></A> who advances the case of some common
    peas, which, after long-continued heavy rain, flowered a second
    time, and produced double flowers.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Seedless Fruit.</I>&#8212;Many of our
    most valuable fruits, although consisting in a homological sense of
    widely different organs, are either quite sterile, or produce
    extremely few seeds. This is notoriously the case with our best
    pears, grapes, and figs, with the pine-apple, banana, bread-fruit,
    pomegranate, azarole, date-palms, and some members of the
    orange-tribe. Poorer varieties of these same fruits either
    habitually or occasionally yield seed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>104</SUP></A> Most horticulturists look at the great
    size and anomalous development of the fruit as the cause, and
    sterility as the result; but the opposite view, as we shall
    presently see, is more probable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sterility from the excessive
    development of the organs of Growth or Vegetation.</I>&#8212;Plants
    which from any cause grow too luxuriantly, and produce leaves,
    stems, runners, suckers, tubers, bulbs, etc., in excess, sometimes
    do not flower, or if they flower do not yield seed. To make
    European vegetables under the hot climate of India yield seed, it
    is necessary to check their growth; and, when one-third grown, they
    are taken up, and their stems and tap-roots are cut or mutilated.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>105</SUP></A> So it is with hybrids; for
    instance, Prof. Lecoq<A href="#refer"><SUP>106</SUP></A> had three
    plants of Mirabilis, which, though they grew luxuriantly and
    flowered, were quite sterile; but after beating one with a stick
    until a few branches alone were left, these at once yielded good
    seed. The sugar-cane, which grows vigorously and produces a large
    supply of succulent stems, never, according to various observers,
    bears seed in the West Indies, Malaga, India, Cochin China,
    Mauritius, or the Malay Archipelago.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>107</SUP></A> Plants which produce a large number of
    tubers are apt to be sterile, as occurs, to a certain extent, with
    the common potato; and Mr. Fortune informs me that the sweet potato
    (<I>Convolvulus batatas</I>) in China never, as far as he has seen,
    yields seed. Dr. Royle remarks<A href="#refer"><SUP>108</SUP></A>
    that in India the <I>Agave vivipara,</I> when grown in rich soil,
    invariably produces bulbs, but no seeds; whilst a poor soil and dry
    climate lead to an opposite result. In China, according to Mr.
    Fortune, an extraordinary number of little bulbs are developed in
    the axils of the leaves of the yam, and this plant does not bear
    seed. Whether in these cases, as in those of double flowers and
    seedless fruit, sexual sterility from changed conditions of life is
    the primary cause which leads to the excessive development of the
    organs of vegetation, is doubtful; though some evidence might be
    advanced in favour of this view. It is perhaps a more probable view
    that plants which propagate themselves largely by one method,
    namely by buds, have not sufficient vital power or organised matter
    for the other method of sexual generation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Several distinguished botanists and good
    practical judges believe that long- continued propagation by
    cuttings, runners, tubers, bulbs, etc., independently of any
    excessive development of these parts, is the cause of many plants
    failing to produce flowers, or producing only barren
    flowers,&#8212;it is as if they had lost the habit of sexual
    generation.<A href="#refer"><SUP>109</SUP></A> That many plants
    when thus propagated are sterile there can be no doubt, but as to
    whether the long continuance of this form of propagation is the
    actual cause of their sterility, I will not venture, from the want
    of sufficient evidence, to express an opinion.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>That plants may be propagated for long
    periods by buds, without the aid of sexual generation, we may
    safely infer from this being the case with many plants which must
    have long survived in a state of nature. As I have had occasion
    before to allude to this subject, I will here give such cases as I
    have collected. Many alpine plants ascend mountains beyond the
    height at which they can produce seed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>110</SUP></A> Certain species of Poa and Festuca,
    when growing on mountain-pastures, propagate themselves, as I hear
    from Mr. Bentham, almost exclusively by bulblets. Kalm gives a more
    curious instance<A href="#refer"><SUP>111</SUP></A> of several
    American trees, which grow so plentifully in marshes or in thick
    woods, that they are certainly well adapted for these stations, yet
    scarcely ever produce seeds; but when accidentally growing on the
    outside of the marsh or wood, are loaded with seed. The common ivy
    is found in Northern Sweden and Russia, but flowers and fruits only
    in the southern provinces. The <I>Acorus calamus</I> extends over a
    large portion of the globe, but so rarely perfects fruit that this
    has been seen only by a few botanists; according to Caspary, all
    its pollen-grains are in a worthless condition.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>112</SUP></A> The <I>Hypericum calycinum,</I> which
    propagates itself so freely in our shrubberies by rhizomes, and is
    naturalised in Ireland, blossoms profusely, but rarely sets any
    seed, and this only during certain years; nor did it set any when
    fertilised in my garden by pollen from plants growing at a
    distance. The <I>Lysimachia nummularia,</I> which is furnished with
    long runners, so seldom produces seed-capsules, that Prof.
    Decaisne,<A href="#refer"><SUP>113</SUP></A> who has especially
    attended to this plant, has never seen it in fruit. The <I>Carex
    rigida</I> often fails to perfect its seed in Scotland, Lapland,
    Greenland, Germany, and New Hampshire in the United States.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>114</SUP></A> The periwinkle (<I>Vinca minor</I>),
    which spreads largely by runners, is said scarcely ever to produce
    fruit in England;<A href="#refer"><SUP>115</SUP></A> but this plant
    requires insect-aid for its fertilisation, and the proper insects
    may be absent or rare. The Jussiaea grandiflora has become
    naturalised in Southern France, and has spread by its rhizomes so
    extensively as to impede the navigation of the waters, but never
    produces fertile seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>116</SUP></A> The
    horse-radish (<I>Cochleria armoracia</I>) spreads pertinaciously
    and is naturalised in various parts of Europe; though it bears
    flowers, these rarely produce capsules: Professor Caspary informs
    me that he has watched this plant since 1851, but has never seen
    its fruit; 65 per cent of its pollen-grains are bad. The common <I>
    Ranunculus ficaria</I> rarely bears seed in England, France, or
    Switzerland; but in 1863 I observed seeds on several plants growing
    near my house.<A href="#refer"><SUP>117</SUP></A> Other cases
    analogous with the foregoing could be given; for instance, some
    kinds of mosses and lichens have never been seen to fructify in
    France.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Some of these endemic and naturalised
    plants are probably rendered sterile from excessive multiplication
    by buds, and their consequent incapacity to produce and nourish
    seed. But the sterility of others more probably depends on the
    peculiar conditions under which they live, as in the case of the
    ivy in the northern part of Europe, and of the trees in the swamps
    of the United States; yet these plants must be in some respects
    eminently well adapted for the stations which they occupy, for they
    hold their places against a host of competitors.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, the high degree of sterility which
    often accompanies the doubling of flowers, or an excessive
    development of fruit, seldom supervenes at once. An incipient
    tendency is observed, and continued selection completes the result.
    The view which seems the most probable, and which connects together
    all the foregoing facts and brings them within our present subject,
    is, that changed and unnatural conditions of life first give a
    tendency to sterility; and in consequence of this, the organs of
    reproduction being no longer able fully to perform their proper
    functions, a supply of organised matter, not required for the
    development of the seed, flows either into these organs and renders
    them foliaceous, or into the fruit, stems, tubers, etc., increasing
    their size and succulency. But it is probable that there exists,
    independently of any incipient sterility, an antagonism between the
    two forms of reproduction, namely, by seed and buds, when either is
    carried to an extreme degree. That incipient sterility plays an
    important part in the doubling of flowers, and in the other cases
    just specified, I infer chiefly from the following facts. When
    fertility is lost from a wholly different cause, namely, from
    hybridism, there is a strong tendency, as G&#228;rtner<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>118</SUP></A> affirms, for flowers to become double,
    and this tendency is inherited. Moreover, it is notorious that with
    hybrids the male organs become sterile before the female organs,
    and with double flowers the stamens first become foliaceous. This
    latter fact is well shown by the male flowers of dioecious plants,
    which, according to Gallesio<A href="#refer"><SUP>119</SUP></A>
    first become double. Again, G&#228;rtner<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>120</SUP></A> often insists that the flowers of even
    utterly sterile hybrids, which do not produce any seed, generally
    yield perfect capsules or fruit,&#8212;a fact which has likewise
    been repeatedly observed by Naudin with the Cucurbitace&#230;; so
    that the production of fruit by plants rendered sterile through any
    cause is intelligible. K&#246;lreuter has also expressed his
    unbounded astonishment at the size and development of the tubers in
    certain hybrids; and all experimentalists<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>121</SUP></A> have remarked on the strong tendency in
    hybrids to increase by roots, runners, and suckers. Seeing that
    hybrid plants, which from their nature are more or less sterile,
    thus tend to produce double flowers; that they have the parts
    including the seed, that is the fruit, perfectly developed, even
    when containing no seed; that they sometimes yield gigantic roots;
    that they almost invariably tend to increase largely by suckers and
    other such means;&#8212;seeing this, and knowing, from the many
    facts given in the earlier parts of this chapter, that almost all
    organic beings when exposed to unnatural conditions tend to become
    more or less sterile, it seems much the most probable view that
    with cultivated plants sterility is the exciting cause, and double
    flowers, rich seedless fruit, and in some cases largely-developed
    organs of vegetation, etc., are the indirect results&#8212;these
    results having been in most cases largely increased through
    continued selection by man.</P>
