    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the previous chapters large classes of facts,
    such as those bearing on bud-variation, the various forms of
    inheritance, the causes and laws of variation, have been discussed;
    and it is obvious that these subjects, as well as the several modes
    of reproduction, stand in some sort of relation to one another. I
    have been led, or rather forced, to form a view which to a certain
    extent connects these facts by a tangible method. Every one would
    wish to explain to himself, even in an imperfect manner, how it is
    possible for a character possessed by some remote ancestor suddenly
    to reappear in the offspring; how the effects of increased or
    decreased use of a limb can be transmitted to the child; how the
    male sexual element can act not solely on the ovules, but
    occasionally on the mother-form; how a hybrid can be produced by
    the union of the cellular tissue of two plants independently of the
    organs of generation; how a limb can be reproduced on the exact
    line of amputation, with neither too much nor too little added; how
    the same organism may be produced by such widely different
    processes, as budding and true seminal generation; and, lastly, how
    of two allied forms, one passes in the course of its development
    through the most complex metamorphoses, and the other does not do
    so, though when mature both are alike in every detail of structure.
    I am aware that my view is merely a provisional hypothesis or
    speculation; but until a better one be advanced, it will serve to
    bring together a multitude of facts which are at present left
    disconnected by any efficient cause. As Whewell, the historian of
    the inductive sciences, remarks:&#8212;"Hypotheses may often be of
    service to science, when they involve a certain portion of
    incompleteness, and even of error." Under this point of view I
    venture to advance the hypothesis of Pangenesis, which implies that
    every separate part of the whole organisation reproduces itself. So
    that ovules, spermatozoa, and pollen-grains,&#8212;the fertilised
    egg or seed, as well as buds,&#8212;include and consist of a
    multitude of germs thrown off from each separate part or unit.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the First Part I will enumerate as briefly as
    I can the groups of facts which seem to demand connection; but
    certain subjects, not hitherto discussed, must be treated at
    disproportionate length. In the Second Part the hypothesis will be
    given; and after considering how far the necessary assumptions are
    in themselves improbable, we shall see whether it serves to bring
    under a single point of view the various facts.</P>

      PART I.
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Reproduction may be divided into two main
    classes, namely, sexual and asexual. The latter is effected in many
    ways&#8212;by the formation of buds of various kinds, and by
    fissiparous generation, that is by spontaneous or artificial
    division. It is notorious that some of the lower animals, when cut
    into many pieces, reproduce so many perfect individuals: Lyonnet
    cut a Nais or freshwater worm into nearly forty pieces, and these
    all reproduced perfect animals.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> It
    is probable that segmentation could be carried much further in some
    of the protozoa; and with some of the lowest plants each cell will
    reproduce the parent-form. Johannes M&#252;ller thought that there
    was an important distinction between gemmation and fission; for in
    the latter case the divided portion, however small, is more fully
    developed than a bud, which also is a younger formation; but most
    physiologists are now convinced that the two processes are
    essentially alike.<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> Prof. Huxley
    remarks, "fission is little more than a peculiar mode of budding,"
    and Prof. H. J. Clark shows in detail that there is sometimes "a
    compromise between self-division and budding." When a limb is
    amputated, or when the whole body is bisected, the cut extremities
    are said to bud forth; and as the papilla, which is first formed,
    consists of undeveloped cellular tissue like that forming an
    ordinary bud, the expression is apparently correct. We see the
    connection of the two processes in another way; for Trembley
    observed with the hydra, that the reproduction of the head after
    amputation was checked as soon as the animal put forth reproductive
    gemm&#230;.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Between the production, by fissiparous
    generation, of two or more complete individuals, and the repair of
    even a very slight injury, there is so perfect a gradation, that it
    is impossible to doubt that the two processes are connected. As at
    each stage of growth an amputated part is replaced by one in the
    same state of development, we must also follow Sir J. Paget in
    admitting, "that the powers of development from the embryo, are
    identical with those exercised for the restoration from injuries:
    in other words, that the powers are the same by which perfection is
    first achieved, and by which, when lost, it is recovered."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Finally, we may conclude that the several
    forms of budding, fissiparous generation, the repair of injuries,
    and development, are all essentially the results of one and the
    same power.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Sexual Generation.</I>&#8212;The union of the
    two sexual elements seems at first sight to make a broad
    distinction between sexual and asexual generation. But the
    conjugation of alg&#230;, by which process the contents of two
    cells unite into a single mass capable of development, apparently
    gives us the first step towards sexual union: and Pringsheim, in
    his memoir on the pairing of Zoospores,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> shows that conjugation graduates into
    true sexual reproduction. Moreover, the now well-ascertained cases
    of Parthenogenesis prove that the distinction between sexual and
    asexual generation is not nearly so great as was formerly thought;
    for ova occasionally, and even in some cases frequently, become
    developed into perfect beings, without the concourse of the male.
    With most of the lower animals and even with mammals, the ova show
    a trace of parthenogenetic power, for without being fertilised they
    pass through the first stages of segmentation.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Nor can pseudova which do not need
    fertilisation, be distinguished from true ova, as was first shown
    by Sir J. Lubbock, and is now admitted by Siebold. So, again, the
    germ-balls in the larv&#230; of Cecidomyia are said by Leuckart<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> to be formed within the ovarium, but
    they do not require to be fertilised. It should also be observed
    that in sexual generation, the ovules and the male element have
    equal power of transmitting every single character possessed by
    either parent to their offspring. We see this clearly when hybrids
    are paired <I>inter se,</I> for the characters of both grandparents
    often appear in the progeny, either perfectly or by segments. It is
    an error to suppose that the male transmits certain characters and
    the female other characters; although no doubt, from unknown
    causes, one sex sometimes has a much stronger power of transmission
    than the other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has, however, been maintained by some authors
    that a bud differs essentially from a fertilised germ, in always
    reproducing the perfect character of the parent-stock; whilst
    fertilised germs give birth to variable beings. But there is no
    such broad distinction as this. In the eleventh chapter numerous
    cases were advanced showing that buds occasionally grow into plants
    having quite new characters; and the varieties thus produced can be
    propagated for a length of time by buds, and occasionally by seed.
    Nevertheless, it must be admitted that beings produced sexually are
    much more liable to vary than those produced asexually; and of this
    fact a partial explanation will hereafter be attempted. The
    variability in both cases is determined by the same general causes,
    and is governed by the same laws. Hence new varieties arising from
    buds cannot be distinguished from those arising from seed. Although
    bud-varieties usually retain their character during successive
    bud-generations, yet they occasionally revert, even after a long
    series of bud-generations, to their former character. This tendency
    to reversion in buds, is one of the most remarkable of the several
    points of agreement between the offspring from bud and seminal
    reproduction.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But there is one difference between organisms
    produced sexually and asexually, which is very general. The former
    pass in the course of their development from a very low stage to
    their highest stage, as we see in the metamorphoses of insects and
    of many other animals, and in the concealed metamorphoses of the
    vertebrata. Animals propagated asexually by buds or fission, on the
    other hand, commence their development at that stage at which the
    budding or self-dividing animal may happen to be, and therefore do
    not pass through some of the lower developmental stages.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Afterwards, they often advance in
    organisation, as we see in the many cases of "alternate
    generation." In thus speaking of alternate generation, I follow
    those naturalists who look at this process as essentially one of
    internal budding or of fissiparous generation. Some of the lower
    plants, however, such as mosses and certain alg&#230;, according to
    Dr. L. Radlkofer,<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> when propagated
    asexually, do undergo a retrogressive metamorphosis. As far as the
    final cause is concerned, we can to a certain extent understand why
    beings propagated by buds should not pass through all the early
    stages of development; for with each organism the structure
    acquired at each stage must be adapted to its peculiar habits; and
    if there are places for the support of many individuals at some one
    stage, the simplest plan will be that they should be multiplied at
    this stage, and not that they should first retrograde in their
    development to an earlier or simpler structure, which might not be
    fitted for the then surrounding conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the several foregoing considerations we may
    conclude that the difference between sexual and asexual generation
    is not nearly so great as at first appears; the chief difference
    being that an ovule cannot continue to live and to be fully
    developed unless it unites with the male element; but even this
    difference is far from invariable, as shown by the many cases of
    parthenogenesis. We are therefore naturally led to inquire what the
    final cause can be of the necessity in ordinary generation for the
    concourse of the two sexual elements.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Seeds and ova are often highly serviceable as
    the means of disseminating plants and animals, and of preserving
    them during one or more seasons in a dormant state; but
    unimpregnated seeds or ova, and detached buds, would be equally
    serviceable for both purposes. We can, however, indicate two
    important advantages gained by the concourse of the two sexes, or
    rather of two individuals belonging to opposite sexes; for, as I
    have shown in a former chapter, the structure of every organism
    appears to be especially adapted for the concurrence, at least
    occasionally, of two individuals. When species are rendered highly
    variable by changed conditions of life, the free intercrossing of
    the varying individuals tends to keep each form fitted for its
    proper place in nature; and crossing can be effected only by sexual
    generation; but whether the end thus gained is of sufficient
    importance to account for the first origin of sexual intercourse is
    extremely doubtful. Secondly, I have shown from a large body of
    facts, that, as a slight change in the conditions of life is
    beneficial to each creature, so, in an analogous manner, is the
    change effected in the germ by sexual union with a distinct
    individual; and I have been led, from observing the many
    widely-extended provisions throughout nature for this purpose, and
    from the greater vigour of crossed organisms of all kinds, as
    proved by direct experiments, as well as from the evil effects of
    close interbreeding when long continued, to believe that the
    advantage thus gained is very great.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Why the germ, which before impregnation
    undergoes a certain amount of development, ceases to progress and
    perishes, unless it be acted on by the male element; and why
    conversely the male element, which in the case of some insects is
    enabled to keep alive for four or five years, and in the case of
    some plants for several years, likewise perishes, unless it acts on
    or unites with the germ, are questions which cannot be answered
    with certainty. It is, however, probable that both sexual elements
    perish, unless brought into union, simply from including too little
    formative matter for independent development. Quatrefages has shown
    in the case of the Teredo,<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> as did
    formerly Prevost and Dumas with other animals, that more than one
    spermatozoon is requisite to fertilise an ovum. This has likewise
    been shown by Newport,<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> who proved
    by numerous experiments, that, when a very small number of
    spermatozoa are applied to the ova of Batrachians, they are only
    partially impregnated, and an embryo is never fully developed. The
    rate also of the segmentation of the ovum is determined by the
    number of the spermatozoa. With respect to plants, nearly the same
    results were obtained by K&#246;lreuter and G&#228;rtner. This last
    careful observer, after making successive trials on a Malva with
    more and more pollen-grains, found,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> that even thirty grains did not
    fertilise a single seed; but when forty grains were applied to the
    stigma, a few seeds of small size were formed. In the case of
    Mirabilis the pollen grains are extraordinarily large, and the
    ovarium contains only a single ovule; and these circumstances led
    Naudin<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> to make the following
    experiments: a flower was fertilised by three grains and succeeded
    perfectly; twelve flowers were fertilised by two grains, and
    seventeen flowers by a single grain, and of these one flower alone
    in each lot perfected its seed: and it deserves especial notice
    that the plants produced by these two seeds never attained their
    proper dimensions, and bore flowers of remarkably small size. From
    these facts we clearly see that the quantity of the peculiar
    formative matter which is contained within the spermatozoa and
    pollen-grains is an all-important element in the act of
    fertilisation, not only for the full development of the seed, but
    for the vigour of the plant produced from such seed. We see
    something of the same kind in certain cases of parthenogenesis,
    that is, when the male element is wholly excluded; for M. Jourdan<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> found that, out of about 58,000
    eggs laid by unimpregnated silk-moths, many passed through their
    early embryonic stages, showing that they were capable of
    self-development, but only twenty-nine out of the whole number
    produced caterpillars. The same principle of quantity seems to hold
    good even in artificial fissiparous reproduction, for Hackel<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> found that by cutting the segmented
    and fertilised ova or larva of Siphonophor&#230; (jelly-fishes)
    into pieces, the smaller the pieces were, the slower was the rate
    of development, and the larv&#230; thus produced were by so much
    the more imperfect and inclined to monstrosity. It seems,
    therefore, probable that with the separate sexual elements
    deficient quantity of formative matter is the main cause of their
    not having the capacity for prolonged existence and development,
    unless they combine and thus increase each other's bulk. The belief
    that it is the function of the spermatozoa to communicate life to
    the ovule seems a strange one, seeing that the unimpregnated ovule
    is already alive and generally undergoes a certain amount of
    independent development. Sexual and asexual reproduction are thus
    seen not to differ essentially; and we have already shown that
    asexual reproduction, the power of re-growth and development are
    all parts of one and the same great law.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Re-growth of amputated parts.</I>&#8212;This
    subject deserves a little further discussion. A multitude of the
    lower animals and some vertebrates possess this wonderful power.
    For instance, Spallanzani cut off the legs and tail of the same
    salamander six times successively, and Bonnet<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> did so eight times; and on each occasion
    the limbs were reproduced on the exact line of amputation, with no
    part deficient or in excess. An allied animal, the axolotl, had a
    limb bitten off, which was reproduced in an abnormal condition, but
    when this was amputated it was replaced by a perfect limb.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> The new limbs in these cases bud forth,
    and are developed in the same manner as during the regular
    development of a young animal. For instance, with the <I>Amblystoma
    lurida,</I> three toes are first developed, then the fourth, and on
    the hind-feet the fifth, and so it is with a reproduced limb.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The power of re-growth is generally much greater
    during the youth of an animal or during the earlier stages of its
    development than during maturity. The larv&#230; or tadpoles of the
    Batrachians are capable of reproducing lost members, but not so the
    adults.<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> Mature insects have no
    power of re-growth, excepting in one order, whilst the larv&#230;
    of many kinds have this power. Animals low in the scale are able,
    as a general rule, to reproduce lost parts far more easily than
    those which are more highly organised. The myriapods offer a good
    illustration of this rule; but there are some strange exceptions to
    it&#8212;thus Nemerteans, though lowly organised, are said to
    exhibit little power of re-growth. With the higher vertebrata, such
    as birds and mammals, the power is extremely limited.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the case of those animals which may be
    bisected or chopped into pieces, and of which every fragment will
    reproduce the whole, the power of re-growth must be diffused
    throughout the whole body. Nevertheless there seems to be much
    truth in the view maintained by Prof. Lessona,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> that this capacity is generally a
    localised and special one, serving to replace parts which are
    eminently liable to be lost in each particular animal. The most
    striking case in favour of this view, is that the terrestrial
    salamander, according to Lessona, cannot reproduce lost parts,
    whilst another species of the same genus, the aquatic salamander,
    has extraordinary powers of re-growth, as we have just seen; and
    this animal is eminently liable to have its limbs, tail, eyes and
    jaws bitten off by other tritons.<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
    Even with the aquatic salamander the capacity is to a certain
    extent localised, for when M. Philipeaux<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> extirpated the entire fore limb together
    with the scapula, the power of re-growth was completely lost. It is
    also a remarkable fact, standing in opposition to a very general
    rule, that the young of the aquatic salamander do not possess the
    power of repairing their limbs in an equal degree with the adults<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> but I do not know that they are
    more active, or can otherwise better escape the loss of their
    limbs, than the adults. The walking-stick insect, <I>Diapheromera
    femorata,</I> like other insects of the same order, can reproduce
    its legs in the mature state, and these from their great length
    must be liable to be lost: but the capacity is localised (as in the
    case of the salamander), for Dr. Scudder found,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> that if the limb was removed within the
    trochanto-femoral articulation, it was never renewed. When a crab
    is seized by one of its legs, this is thrown off at the basal
    joint, being afterwards replaced by a new leg; and it is generally
    admitted that this is a special provision for the safety of the
    animal. Lastly, with gasteropod molluscs, which are well known to
    have the power of reproducing their heads, Lessona shows that they
    are very liable to have their heads bitten off by fishes; the rest
    of the body being protected by the shell. Even with plants we see
    something of the same kind, for non-deciduous leaves and young
    stems have no power of re-growth, these parts being easily replaced
    by growth from new buds; whilst the bark and subjacent tissues of
    the trunks of trees have great power of re-growth, probably on
    account of their increase in diameter, and of their liability to
    injury from being gnawed by animals.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Graft-hybrids.</I>&#8212;It is well known
    from innumerable trials made in all parts of the world, that buds
    may be inserted into a stock, and that the plants thus raised are
    not affected in a greater degree than can be accounted for by
    changed nutrition. Nor do the seedlings raised from such inserted
    buds partake of the character of the stock, though they are more
    liable to vary than are seedlings from the same variety growing on
    its own roots. A bud, also, may sport into a new and
    strongly-marked variety without any other bud on the same plant
    being in the least degree affected. We may therefore infer, in
    accordance with the common view, that each bud is a distinct
    individual, and that its formative elements do not spread beyond
    the parts subsequently developed from it. Nevertheless, we have
    seen in the abstract on graft-hybridisation in the eleventh chapter
    that buds certainly include formative matter, which can
    occasionally combine with that included in the tissues of a
    distinct variety or species; a plant intermediate between the two
    parent-forms being thus produced. In the case of the potato we have
    seen that the tubers produced from a bud of one kind inserted into
    another are intermediate in colour, size, shape and state of
    surface; that the stems, foliage, and even certain constitutional
    peculiarities, such as precocity, are likewise intermediate. With
    these well-established cases, the evidence that graft-hybrids have
    also been produced with the laburnum, orange, vine, rose, etc.,
    seems sufficient. But we do not know under what conditions this
    rare form of reproduction is possible. From these several cases we
    learn the important fact that formative elements capable of
    blending with those of a distinct individual (and this is the chief
    characteristic of sexual generation), are not confined to the
    reproductive organs, but are present in the buds and cellular
    tissue of plants; and this is a fact of the highest physiological
    importance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Direct Action of the Male Element on the
    Female.</I>&#8212;In the eleventh chapter, abundant proofs were
    given that foreign pollen occasionally affects in a direct manner
    the mother-plant. Thus, when Gallesio fertilised an orange-flower
    with pollen from the lemon, the fruit bore stripes of perfectly
    characterised lemon-peel. With peas, several observers have seen
    the colour of the seed-coats and even of the pod directly affected
    by the pollen of a distinct variety. So it has been with the fruit
    of the apple, which consists of the modified calyx and upper part
    of the flower-stalk. In ordinary cases these parts are wholly
    formed by the mother-plant. We here see that the formative elements
    included within the male element or pollen of one variety can
    affect and hybridise, not the part which they are properly adapted
    to affect, namely, the ovules, but the partially-developed tissues
    of a distinct variety or species. We are thus brought half-way
    towards a graft-hybrid, in which the formative elements included
    within the tissues of one individual combine with those included in
    the tissues of a distinct variety or species, thus giving rise to a
    new and intermediate form, independently of the male or female
    sexual organs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With animals which do not breed until nearly
    mature, and of which all the parts are then fully developed, it is
    hardly possible that the male element should directly affect the
    female. But we have the analogous and perfectly well-ascertained
    case of the male element affecting (as with the quagga and Lord
    Morton's mare) the female or her ova, in such a manner that when
    she is impregnated by another male her offspring are affected and
    hybridised by the first male. The explanation would be simple if
    the spermatozoa could keep alive within the body of the female
    during the long interval which has sometimes elapsed between the
    two acts of impregnation; but no one will suppose that this is
    possible with the higher animals.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Development.</I>&#8212;The fertilised germ
    reaches maturity by a vast number of changes: these are either
    slight and slowly effected, as when the child grows into the man,
    or are great and sudden, as with the metamorphoses of most insects.
    Between these extremes we have every gradation, even within the
    same class; thus, as Sir J. Lubbock has shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> there is an Ephemerous insect which
    moults above twenty times, undergoing each time a slight but
    decided change of structure; and these changes, as he further
    remarks, probably reveal to us the normal stages of development,
    which are concealed and hurried through or suppressed in most other
    insects. In ordinary metamorphoses, the parts and organs appear to
    become changed into the corresponding parts in the next stage of
    development; but there is another form of development, which has
    been called by Professor Owen metagenesis. In this case "the new
    parts are not moulded upon the inner surface of the old ones. The
    plastic force has changed its course of operation. The outer case,
    and all that gave form and character to the precedent individual,
    perish and are cast off; they are not changed into the
    corresponding parts of the new individual. These are due to a new
    and distinct developmental process," etc.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> Metamorphosis, however, graduates so
    insensibly, into metagenesis, that the two processes cannot be
    distinctly separated. For instance, in the last change which
    Cirripedes undergo, the alimentary canal and some other organs are
    moulded on pre-existing parts; but the eyes of the old and the
    young animal are developed in entirely different parts of the body;
    the tips of the mature limbs are formed within the larval limbs,
    and may be said to be metamorphosed from them; but their basal
    portions and the whole thorax are developed in a plane at right
    angles to the larval limbs and thorax; and this may be called
    metagenesis. The metagenetic process is carried to an extreme point
    in the development of some Echinoderms, for the animal in the
    second stage of development is formed almost like a bud within the
    animal of the first stage, the latter being then cast off like an
    old vestment, yet sometimes maintaining for a short period an
    independent vitality.<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If, instead of a single individual, several were
    to be thus developed metagenetically within a pre-existing form,
    the process would be called one of alternate generation. The young
    thus developed may either closely resemble the encasing
    parent-form, as with the larv&#230; of Cecidomyia, or may differ to
    an astonishing degree, as with many parasitic worms and
    jelly-fishes; but this does not make any essential difference in
    the process, any more than the greatness or abruptness of the
    change in the metamorphoses of insects.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The whole question of development is of great
    importance for our present subject. When an organ, the eye, for
    instance, is metagenetically formed in a part of the body where
    during the previous stage of development no eye existed, we must
    look at it as a new and independent growth. The absolute
    independence of new and old structures, although corresponding in
    structure and function, is still more obvious when several
    individuals are formed within a previous form, as in the cases of
    alternate generation. The same important principle probably comes
    largely into play even in the case of apparently continuous growth,
    as we shall see when we consider the inheritance of modifications
    at corresponding ages.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We are led to the same conclusion, namely, the
    independence of parts successively developed, by another and quite
    distinct group of facts. It is well known that many animals
    belonging to the same order, and therefore not differing widely
    from each other, pass through an extremely different course of
    development. Thus certain beetles, not in any way remarkably
    different from others of the same order, undergo what has been
    called a hyper-metamorphosis&#8212;that is, they pass through an
    early stage wholly different from the ordinary grub-like larva. In
    the same sub-order of crabs, namely, the Macroura, as Fritz
    M&#252;ller remarks, the river cray-fish is hatched under the same
    form which it ever afterwards retains; the young lobster has
    divided legs, like a Mysis; the Pal&#230;mon appears under the form
    of a Zoea, and Peneus under the Nauplius-form; and how wonderfully
    these larval forms differ from one another, is known to every
    naturalist.<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> Some other
    crustaceans, as the same author observes, start from the same point
    and arrive at nearly the same end, but in the middle of their
    development are widely different from one another. Still more
    striking cases could be given with respect to the Echinodermata.
    With the Medus&#230; or jelly-fishes Professor Allman observes,
    "The classification of the Hydroida would be a comparatively simple
    task if, as has been erroneously asserted, generically-identical
    medusoids always arose from generically-identical polypoids; and,
    on the other hand, that generically-identical polypoids always gave
    origin to generically-identical medusoids." So again, Dr. Strethill
    Wright remarks, "In the life-history of the Hydroid&#230; any
    phase, planuloid, polypoid, or medusoid, may be absent."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">According to the belief now generally accepted
    by our best naturalists, all the members of the same order or
    class, for instance, the Medus&#230; or the Macrourous crustaceans,
    are descended from a common progenitor. During their descent they
    have diverged much in structure, but have retained much in common;
    and this has occurred, though they have passed through and still
    pass through marvellously different metamorphoses. This fact well
    illustrates how independent each structure is from that which
    precedes and that which follows it in the course of
    development.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>The Functional Independence of the Elements
    or Units of the Body.</I>&#8212;Physiologists agree that the whole
    organism consists of a multitude of elemental parts, which are to a
    great extent independent of one another. Each organ, says Claude
    Bernard,<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> has its proper life, its
    autonomy; it can develop and reproduce itself independently of the
    adjoining tissues. A great German authority, Virchow,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> asserts still more emphatically that
    each system consists of an "enormous mass of minute centres of
    action. . . . Every element has its own special action, and even
    though it derive its stimulus to activity from other parts, yet
    alone effects the actual performance of duties. . . . Every single
    epithelial and muscular fibre-cell leads a sort of parasitical
    existence in relation to the rest of the body. . . . Every single
    bone-corpuscle really possesses conditions of nutrition peculiar to
    itself." Each element, as Sir J. Paget remarks, lives its appointed
    time and then dies, and is replaced after being cast off or
    absorbed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> I presume that no
    physiologist doubts that, for instance, each bone-corpuscle of the
    finger differs from the corresponding corpuscle in the
    corresponding joint of the toe; and there can hardly be a doubt
    that even those on the corresponding sides of the body differ,
    though almost identical in nature. This near approach to identity
    is curiously shown in many diseases in which the same exact points
    on the right and left sides of the body are similarly affected;
    thus Sir J. Paget<A href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> gives a drawing
    of a diseased pelvis, in which the bone has grown into a most
    complicated pattern, but "there is not one spot or line on one side
    which is not represented, as exactly as it would be in a mirror, on
    the other."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Many facts support this view of the independent
    life of each minute element of the body. Virchow insists that a
    single bone-corpuscle or a single cell in the skin may become
    diseased. The spur of a cock, after being inserted into the ear of
    an ox, lived for eight years, and acquired a weight of 396 grammes
    (nearly fourteen ounces), and the astonishing length of twenty-four
    centimetres, or about nine inches; so that the head of the ox
    appeared to bear three horns.<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> The
    tail of a pig has been grafted into the middle of its back, and
    reacquired sensibility. Dr. Ollier<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> inserted a piece of periosteum from the
    bone of a young dog under the skin of a rabbit, and true bone was
    developed. A multitude of similar facts could be given. The
    frequent presence of hairs and of perfectly developed teeth, even
    teeth of the second dentition, in ovarian tumours,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> are facts leading to the same
    conclusion. Mr. Lawson Tait refers to a tumour in which "over 300
    teeth were found, resembling in many respects milk-teeth;" and to
    another tumour, "full of hair which had grown and been shed from
    one little spot of skin not bigger than the tip of my little
    finger. The amount of hair in the sac, had it grown from a
    similarly sized area of the scalp, would have taken almost a
    lifetime to grow and be shed."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whether each of the innumerable autonomous
    elements of the body is a cell or the modified product of a cell,
    is a more doubtful question, even if so wide a definition be given
    to the term, as to include cell-like bodies without walls and
    without nuclei.<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> The doctrine of
    <I>omnis cellula e cellul&#226;</I> is admitted for plants, and
    widely prevails with respect to animals.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Thus Virchow, the great supporter of the
    cellular theory, whilst allowing that difficulties exist, maintains
    that every atom of tissue is derived from cells, and these from
    pre-existing cells, and these primarily from the egg, which he
    regards as a great cell. That cells, still retaining the same
    nature, increase by self-division or proliferation, is admitted by
    every one. But when an organism undergoes great changes of
    structure during development, the cells, which at each stage are
    supposed to be directly derived from previously existing cells,
    must likewise be greatly changed in nature; this change is
    attributed by the supporters of the cellular doctrine to some
    inherent power which the cells possess, and not to any external
    agency. Others maintain that cells and tissues of all kinds may be
    formed, independently of pre-existing cells, from plastic lymph or
    blastema. Whichever view may be correct, every one admits that the
    body consists of a multitude of organic units, all of which possess
    their own proper attributes, and are to a certain extent
    independent of all others. Hence it will be convenient to use
    indifferently the terms cells or organic units, or simply
    units.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Variability and Inheritance.</I>&#8212;We
    have seen in the twenty-second chapter that variability is not a
    principle co-ordinate with life or reproduction, but results from
    special causes, generally from changed conditions acting during
    successive generations. The fluctuating variability thus induced is
    apparently due in part to the sexual system being easily affected,
    so that it is often rendered impotent; and when not so seriously
    affected, it often fails in its proper function of transmitting
    truly the characters of the parents to the offspring. But
    variability is not necessarily connected with the sexual system, as
    we see in the cases of bud-variation. Although we are seldom able
    to trace the nature of the connection, many deviations of structure
    no doubt result from changed conditions acting directly on the
    organisation, independently of the reproductive system. In some
    instances we may feel sure of this, when all, or nearly all the
    individuals which have been similarly exposed are similarly and
    definitely affected, of which several instances have been given.
    But it is by no means clear why the offspring should be affected by
    the exposure of the parents to new conditions, and why it is
    necessary in most cases that several generations should have been
    thus exposed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">How, again, can we explain the inherited effects
    of the use or disuse of particular organs? The domesticated duck
    flies less and walks more than the wild duck, and its limb-bones
    have become diminished and increased in a corresponding manner in
    comparison with those of the wild duck. A horse is trained to
    certain paces, and the colt inherits similar consensual movements.
    The domesticated rabbit becomes tame from close confinement; the
    dog, intelligent from associating with man; the retriever is taught
    to fetch and carry; and these mental endowments and bodily powers
    are all inherited. Nothing in the whole circuit of physiology is
    more wonderful. How can the use or disuse of a particular limb or
    of the brain affect a small aggregate of reproductive cells, seated
    in a distant part of the body, in such a manner that the being
    developed from these cells inherits the characters of either one or
    both parents? Even an imperfect answer to this question would be
    satisfactory.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the chapters devoted to inheritance it was
    shown that a multitude of newly acquired characters, whether
    injurious or beneficial, whether of the lowest or highest vital
    importance, are often faithfully transmitted&#8212;frequently even
    when one parent alone possesses some new peculiarity; and we may on
    the whole conclude that inheritance is the rule, and
    non-inheritance the anomaly. In some instances a character is not
    inherited, from the conditions of life being directly opposed to
    its development; in many instances, from the conditions incessantly
    inducing fresh variability, as with grafted fruit-trees and
    highly-cultivated flowers. In the remaining cases the failure may
    be attributed to reversion, by which the child resembles its
    grandparents or more remote progenitors, instead of its
    parents.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Inheritance is governed by various laws.
    Characters which first appear at any particular age tend to
    reappear at a corresponding age. They often become associated with
    certain seasons of the year, and reappear in the offspring at a
    corresponding season. If they appear rather late in life in one
    sex, they tend to reappear exclusively in the same sex at the same
    period of life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The principle of reversion, recently alluded to,
    is one of the most wonderful of the attributes of Inheritance. It
    proves to us that the transmission of a character and its
    development, which ordinarily go together and thus escape
    discrimination, are distinct powers; and these powers in some cases
    are even antagonistic, for each acts alternately in successive
    generations. Reversion is not a rare event, depending on some
    unusual or favourable combination of circumstances, but occurs so
    regularly with crossed animals and plants, and so frequently with
    uncrossed breeds, that it is evidently an essential part of the
    principle of inheritance. We know that changed conditions have the
    power of evoking long-lost characters, as in the case of animals
    becoming feral. The act of crossing in itself possesses this power
    in a high degree. What can be more wonderful than that characters,
    which have disappeared during scores, or hundreds, or even
    thousands of generations, should suddenly reappear perfectly
    developed, as in the case of pigeons and fowls, both when purely
    bred and especially when crossed; or as with the zebrine stripes on
    dun-coloured horses, and other such cases? Many monstrosities come
    under this same head, as when rudimentary organs are redeveloped,
    or when an organ which we must believe was possessed by an early
    progenitor of the species, but of which not even a rudiment is
    left, suddenly reappears, as with the fifth stamen in some
    Scrophulariace&#230;. We have already seen that reversion acts in
    bud-reproduction; and we know that it occasionally acts during the
    growth of the same individual animal, especially, but not
    exclusively, if of crossed parentage,&#8212;as in the rare cases
    described of fowls, pigeons, cattle, and rabbits, which have
    reverted to the colours of one of their parents or ancestors as
    they advanced in years.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We are led to believe, as formerly explained,
    that every character which occasionally reappears is present in a
    latent form in each generation, in nearly the same manner as in
    male and female animals the secondary characters of the opposite
    sex lie latent and ready to be evolved when the reproductive organs
    are injured. This comparison of the secondary sexual characters
    which lie latent in both sexes, with other latent characters, is
    the more appropriate from the case recorded of a Hen, which assumed
    some of the masculine characters, not of her own race, but of an
    early progenitor; she thus exhibited at the same time the
    redevelopment of latent characters of both kinds. In every living
    creature we may feel assured that a host of long-lost characters
    lie ready to be evolved under proper conditions. How can we make
    intelligible and connect with other facts, this wonderful and
    common capacity of reversion,&#8212;this power of calling back to
    life long-lost characters?</P>

    <CENTER>
      PART II.
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have now enumerated the chief facts which
    every one would desire to see connected by some intelligible bond.
    This can be done, if we make the following assumptions, and much
    may be advanced in favour of the chief one. The secondary
    assumptions can likewise be supported by various physiological
    considerations. It is universally admitted that the cells or units
    of the body increase by self-division or proliferation, retaining
    the same nature, and that they ultimately become converted into the
    various tissues and substances of the body. But besides this means
    of increase I assume that the units throw off minute granules which
    are dispersed throughout the whole system; that these, when
    supplied with proper nutriment, multiply by self-division, and are
    ultimately developed into units like those from which they were
    originally derived. These granules may be called gemmules. They are
    collected from all parts of the system to constitute the sexual
    elements, and their development in the next generation forms a new
    being; but they are likewise capable of transmission in a dormant
    state to future generations and may then be developed. Their
    development depends on their union with other partially developed
    or nascent cells which precede them in the regular course of
    growth. Why I use the term union, will be seen when we discuss the
    direct action of pollen on the tissues of the mother-plant.
    Gemmules are supposed to be thrown off by every unit, not only
    during the adult state, but during each stage of development of
    every organism; but not necessarily during the continued existence
    of the same unit. Lastly, I assume that the gemmules in their
    dormant state have a mutual affinity for each other, leading to
    their aggregation into buds or into the sexual elements. Hence, it
    is not the reproductive organs or buds which generate new
    organisms, but the units of which each individual is composed.
    These assumptions constitute the provisional hypothesis which I
    have called Pangenesis. Views in many respects similar have been
    propounded by various authors.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Before proceeding to show, firstly, how far
    these assumptions are in themselves probable, and secondly, how far
    they connect and explain the various groups of facts with which we
    are concerned, it may be useful to give an illustration, as simple
    as possible, of the hypothesis. If one of the Protozoa be formed,
    as it appears under the microscope, of a small mass of homogeneous
    gelatinous matter, a minute particle or gemmule thrown off from any
    part and nourished under favourable circumstances would reproduce
    the whole; but if the upper and lower surfaces were to differ in
    texture from each other and from the central portion, then all
    three parts would have to throw off gemmules, which when aggregated
    by mutual affinity would form either buds or the sexual elements,
    and would ultimately be developed into a similar organism.
    Precisely the same view may be extended to one of the higher
    animals; although in this case many thousand gemmules must be
    thrown off from the various parts of the body at each stage of
    development; these gemmules being developed in union with
    pre-existing nascent cells in due order of succession.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Physiologists maintain, as we have seen, that
    each unit of the body, though to a large extent dependent on
    others, is likewise to a certain extent independent or autonomous,
    and has the power of increasing by self-division. I go one step
    further, and assume that each unit casts off free gemmules which
    are dispersed throughout the system, and are capable under proper
    conditions of being developed into similar units. Nor can this
    assumption be considered as gratuitous and improbable. It is
    manifest that the sexual elements and buds include formative matter
    of some kind, capable of development; and we now know from the
    production of graft-hybrids that similar matter is dispersed
    throughout the tissues of plants, and can combine with that of
    another and distinct plant, giving rise to a new being,
    intermediate in character. We know also that the male element can
    act directly on the partially developed tissues of the
    mother-plant, and on the future progeny of female animals. The
    formative matter which is thus dispersed throughout the tissues of
    plants, and which is capable of being developed into each unit or
    part, must be generated there by some means; and my chief
    assumption is that this matter consists of minute particles or
    gemmules cast off from each unit or cell.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But I have further to assume that the gemmules
    in their undeveloped state are capable of largely multiplying
    themselves by self-division, like independent organisms. Delpino
    insists that to "admit of multiplication by fissiparity in
    corpuscles, analogous to seeds or buds . . . is repugnant to all
    analogy." But this seems a strange objection, as Thuret<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> has seen the zoospore of an alga divide
    itself, and each half germinated. Haeckel divided the segmented
    ovum of a siphonophora into many pieces, and these were developed.
    Nor does the extreme minuteness of the gemmules, which can hardly
    differ much in nature from the lowest and simplest organisms,
    render it improbable that they should grow and multiply. A great
    authority, Dr. Beale,<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> says "that
    minute yeast cells are capable of throwing off buds or gemmules,
    much less than the 1/100000 of an inch in diameter;" and these he
    thinks are "capable of subdivision practically ad infinitum."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A particle of small-pox matter, so minute as to
    be borne by the wind, must multiply itself many thousandfold in a
    person thus inoculated; and so with the contagious matter of
    scarlet fever.<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> It has recently
    been ascertained<A href="#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> that a minute
    portion of the mucous discharge from an animal affected with
    rinderpest, if placed in the blood of a healthy ox, increases so
    fast that in a short space of time "the whole mass of blood,
    weighing many pounds, is infected, and every small particle of that
    blood contains enough poison to give, within less than forty-eight
    hours, the disease to another animal."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The retention of free and undeveloped gemmules
    in the same body from early youth to old age will appear
    improbable, but we should remember how long seeds lie dormant in
    the earth and buds in the bark of a tree. Their transmission from
    generation to generation will appear still more improbable; but
    here again we should remember that many rudimentary and useless
    organs have been transmitted during an indefinite number of
    generations. We shall presently see how well the long-continued
    transmission of undeveloped gemmules explains many facts.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As each unit, or group of similar units,
    throughout the body, casts off its gemmules, and as all are
    contained within the smallest ovule, and within each spermatozoon
    or pollen-grain, and as some animals and plants produce an
    astonishing number of pollen-grains and ovules,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> the number and minuteness of the
    gemmules must be something inconceivable. But considering how
    minute the molecules are, and how many go to the formation of the
    smallest granule of any ordinary substance, this difficulty with
    respect to the gemmules is not insuperable. From the data arrived
    at by Sir W. Thomson, my son George finds that a cube of 1/10000 of
    an inch of glass or water must consist of between 16 million
    millions, and 131 thousand million million molecules. No doubt the
    molecules of which an organism is formed are larger, from being
    more complex, than those of an inorganic substance, and probably
    many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule; but when we bear
    in mind that a cube of 1/10000 of an inch is much smaller than any
    pollen-grain, ovule or bud, we can see what a vast number of
    gemmules one of these bodies might contain.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The gemmules derived from each part or organ
    must be thoroughly dispersed throughout the whole system. We know,
    for instance, that even a minute fragment of a leaf of a Begonia
    will reproduce the whole plant; and that if a fresh-water worm is
    chopped into small pieces, each will reproduce the whole animal.
    Considering also the minuteness of the gemmules and the
    permeability of all organic tissues, the thorough dispersion of the
    gemmules is not surprising. That matter may be readily transferred
    without the aid of vessels from part to part of the body, we have a
    good instance in a case recorded by Sir J. Paget of a lady, whose
    hair lost its colour at each successive attack of neuralgia and
    recovered it again in the course of a few days. With plants,
    however, and probably with compound animals, such as corals, the
    gemmules do not ordinarily spread from bud to bud, but are confined
    to the parts developed from each separate bud; and of this fact no
    explanation can be given.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The assumed elective affinity of each gemmule
    for that particular cell which precedes it in due order of
    development is supported by many analogies. In all ordinary cases
    of sexual reproduction, the male and female elements certainly have
    a mutual affinity for each other: thus, it is believed that about
    ten thousand species of Composit&#230; exist, and there can be no
    doubt that if the pollen of all these species could be
    simultaneously or successively placed on the stigma of any one
    species, this one would elect with unerring certainty its own
    pollen. This elective capacity is all the more wonderful, as it
    must have been acquired since the many species of this great group
    of plants branched off from a common progenitor. On any view of the
    nature of sexual reproduction, the formative matter of each part
    contained within the ovules and the male element act on each other
    by some law of special affinity, so that corresponding parts affect
    one another; thus, a calf produced from a short-horned cow by a
    long-horned bull has its horns affected by the union of the two
    forms, and the offspring from two birds with differently coloured
    tails have their tails affected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The various tissues of the body plainly show, as
    many physiologists have insisted,<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
    an affinity for special organic substances, whether natural or
    foreign to the body. We see this in the cells of the kidneys
    attracting urea from the blood; in curare affecting certain nerves;
    <I>Lytta vesicatoria</I> the kidneys; and the poisonous matter of
    various diseases, as small-pox, scarlet-fever, hooping-cough,
    glanders, and hydrophobia, affecting certain definite parts of the
    body.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has also been assumed that the development of
    each gemmule depends on its union with another cell or unit which
    has just commenced its development, and which precedes it in due
    order of growth. That the formative matter within the pollen of
    plants, which by our hypothesis consists of gemmules, can unite
    with and modify the partially developed cells of the mother-plant,
    we have clearly seen in the section devoted to this subject. As the
    tissues of plants are formed, as far as is known, only by the
    proliferation of pre-existing cells, we must conclude that the
    gemmules derived from the foreign pollen do not become developed
    into new and separate cells, but penetrate and modify the nascent
    cells of the mother-plant. This process may be compared with what
    takes place in the act of ordinary fertilisation, during which the
    contents of the pollen-tubes penetrate the closed embryonic sac
    within the ovule, and determine the development of the embryo.
    According to this view, the cells of the mother-plant may almost
    literally be said to be fertilised by the gemmules derived from the
    foreign pollen. In this case and in all others the proper gemmules
    must combine in due order with pre-existing nascent cells, owing to
    their elective affinities. A slight difference in nature between
    the gemmules and the nascent cells would be far from interfering
    with their mutual union and development, for we well know in the
    case of ordinary reproduction that such slight differentiation in
    the sexual elements favours in a marked manner their union and
    subsequent development, as well as the vigour of the offspring thus
    produced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Thus far we have been able by the aid of our
    hypothesis to throw some obscure light on the problems which have
    come before us; but it must be confessed that many points remain
    altogether doubtful. Thus it is useless to speculate at what period
    of development each unit of the body casts off its gemmules, as the
    whole subject of the development of the various tissues is as yet
    far from clear. We do not know whether the gemmules are merely
    collected by some unknown means at certain seasons within the
    reproductive organs, or whether after being thus collected they
    rapidly multiply there, as the flow of blood to these organs at
    each breeding season seems to render probable. Nor do we know why
    the gemmules collect to form buds in certain definite places,
    leading to the symmetrical growth of trees and corals. We have no
    means of deciding whether the ordinary wear and tear of the tissues
    is made good by means of gemmules, or merely by the proliferation
    of pre-existing cells. If the gemmules are thus consumed, as seems
    probable from the intimate connection between the repair of waste,
    re-growth, and development, and more especially from the periodical
    changes which many male animals undergo in colour and structure,
    then some light would be thrown on the phenomena of old age, with
    its lessened power of reproduction and of the repair of injuries,
    and on the obscure subject of longevity. The fact of castrated
    animals, which do not cast off innumerable gemmules in the act of
    reproduction, not being longer-lived than perfect males, seems
    opposed to the belief that gemmules are consumed in the ordinary
    repair of wasted tissues; unless indeed the gemmules after being
    collected in small numbers within the reproductive organs are there
    largely multiplied.<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That the same cells or units may live for a long
    period and continue multiplying without being modified by their
    union with free gemmules of any kind, is probable from such cases
    as that of the spur of a cock which grew to an enormous size when
    grafted into the ear of an ox. How far units are modified during
    their normal growth by absorbing peculiar nutriment from the
    surrounding tissues, independently of their union with gemmules of
    a distinct nature, is another doubtful point.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> We shall appreciate this difficulty by
    calling to mind what complex yet symmetrical growths the cells of
    plants yield when inoculated by the poison of a gall-insect. With
    animals various polypoid excrescences and tumours are generally
    admitted<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> to be the direct
    product, through proliferation, of normal cells which have become
    abnormal. In the regular growth and repair of bones, the tissues
    undergo, as Virchow remarks,<A href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> a
    whole series of permutations and substitutions. "The cartilage
    cells may be converted by a direct transformation into
    marrow-cells, and continue as such; or they may first be converted
    into osseous and then into medullary tissue; or lastly, they may
    first be converted into marrow and then into bone. So variable are
    the permutations of these tissues, in themselves so nearly allied,
    and yet in their external appearance so completely distinct." But
    as these tissues thus change their nature at any age, without any
    obvious change in their nutrition, we must suppose in accordance
    with our hypothesis that gemmules derived from one kind of tissue
    combine with the cells of another kind, and cause the successive
    modifications.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have good reason to believe that several
    gemmules are requisite for the development of one and the same unit
    or cell; for we cannot otherwise understand the insufficiency of a
    single or even of two or three pollen-grains or spermatozoa. But we
    are far from knowing whether the gemmules of all the units are free
    and separate from one another, or whether some are from the first
    united into small aggregates. A feather, for instance, is a complex
    structure, and, as each separate part is liable to inherited
    variations, I conclude that each feather generates a large number
    of gemmules; but it is possible that these may be aggregated into a
    compound gemmule. The same remark applies to the petals of flowers,
    which are sometimes highly complex structures, with each ridge and
    hollow contrived for a special purpose, so that each part must have
    been separately modified, and the modifications transmitted;
    consequently, separate gemmules, according to our hypothesis, must
    have been thrown off from each cell or unit. But, as we sometimes
    see half an anther or a small portion of a filament becoming
    petali-form, or parts or mere stripes of the calyx assuming the
    colour and texture of the corolla, it is probable that with petals
    the gemmules of each cell are not aggregated together into a
    compound gemmule, but are free and separate. Even in so simple a
    case as that of a perfect cell, with its protoplasmic contents,
    nucleus, nucleolus, and walls, we do not know whether or not its
    development depends on a compound gemmule derived from each part.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Having now endeavoured to show that the several
    foregoing assumptions are to a certain extent supported by
    analogous facts, and having alluded to some of the most doubtful
    points, we will consider how far the hypothesis brings under a
    single point of view the various cases enumerated in the First
    Part. All the forms of reproduction graduate into one another and
    agree in their product; for it is impossible to distinguish between
    organisms produced from buds, from self-division, or from
    fertilised germs; such organisms are liable to variations of the
    same nature and to reversions of the same kind; and as, according
    to our hypothesis, all the forms of reproduction depend on the
    aggregation of gemmules derived from the whole body, we can
    understand this remarkable agreement. Parthenogenesis is no longer
    wonderful, and if we did not know that great good followed from the
    union of the sexual elements derived from two distinct individuals,
    the wonder would be that parthenogenesis did not occur much oftener
    than it does. On any ordinary theory of reproduction the formation
    of graft-hybrids, and the action of the male element on the tissues
    of the mother-plant, as well as on the future progeny of female
    animals, are great anomalies; but they are intelligible on our
    hypothesis. The reproductive organs do not actually create the
    sexual elements; they merely determine the aggregation and perhaps
    the multiplication of the gemmules in a special manner. These
    organs, however, together with their accessory parts, have high
    functions to perform. They adapt one or both elements for
    independent temporary existence, and for mutual union. The
    stigmatic secretion acts on the pollen of a plant of the same
    species in a wholly different manner to what it does on the pollen
    of one belonging to a distinct genus or family. The spermatophores
    of the Cephalopoda are wonderfully complex structures, which were
    formerly mistaken for parasitic worms; and the spermatozoa of some
    animals possess attributes which, if observed in an independent
    animal, would be put down to instinct guided by
    sense-organs,&#8212;as when the spermatozoa of an insect find their
    way into the minute micropyle of the egg.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The antagonism which has long been observed,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> with certain exceptions, between
    growth and the power of sexual reproduction<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A>&#8212;between the repair of injuries and
    gemmation&#8212;and with plants, between rapid increase by buds,
    rhizomes, etc., and the production of seed, is partly explained by
    the gemmules not existing in sufficient numbers for these processes
    to be carried on simultaneously.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Hardly any fact in physiology is more wonderful
    than the power of re-growth; for instance, that a snail should be
    able to reproduce its head, or a salamander its eyes, tail, and
    legs, exactly at the points where they have been cut off. Such
    cases are explained by the presence of gemmules derived from each
    part, and disseminated throughout the body. I have heard the
    process compared with that of the repair of the broken angles of a
    crystal by re-crystallisation; and the two processes have this much
    in common, that in the one case the polarity of the molecules is
    the efficient cause, and in the other the affinity of the gemmules
    for particular nascent cells. But we have here to encounter two
    objections which apply not only to the re-growth of a part, or of a
    bisected individual, but to fissiparous generation and budding. The
    first objection is that the part which is reproduced is in the same
    stage of development as that of the being which has been operated
    on or bisected; and in the case of buds, that the new beings thus
    produced are in the same stage as that of the budding parent. Thus
    a mature salamander, of which the tail has been cut off, does not
    reproduce a larval tail; and a crab does not reproduce a larval
    leg. In the case of budding it was shown in the first part of this
    chapter that the new being thus produced does not retrograde in
    development,&#8212;that is, does not pass through those earlier
    stages, which the fertilised germ has to pass through.
    Nevertheless, the organisms operated on or multiplying themselves
    by buds must, by our hypothesis, include innumerable gemmules
    derived from every part or unit of the earlier stages of
    development; and why do not such gemmules reproduce the amputated
    part or the whole body at a corresponding early stage of
    development?</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The second objection, which has been insisted on
    by Delpino, is that the tissues, for instance, of a mature
    salamander or crab, of which a limb has been removed, are already
    differentiated and have passed through their whole course of
    development; and how can such tissues in accordance with our
    hypothesis attract and combine with the gemmules of the part which
    is to be reproduced? In answer to these two objections we must bear
    in mind the evidence which has been advanced, showing that at least
    in a large number of cases the power of re-growth is a localised
    faculty, acquired for the sake of repairing special injuries to
    which each particular creature is liable; and in the case of buds
    or fissiparous generation, for the sake of quickly multiplying the
    organism at a period of life when it can be supported in large
    numbers. These considerations lead us to believe that in all such
    cases a stock of nascent cells or of partially developed gemmules
    are retained for this special purpose either locally or throughout
    the body, ready to combine with the gemmules derived from the cells
    which come next in due succession. If this be admitted we have a
    sufficient answer to the above two objections. Anyhow, pangenesis
    seems to throw a considerable amount of light on the wonderful
    power of re-growth.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It follows, also, from the view just given, that
    the sexual elements differ from buds in not including nascent cells
    or gemmules in a somewhat advanced stage of development, so that
    only the gemmules belonging to the earliest stages are first
    developed. As young animals and those which stand low in the scale
    generally have a much greater capacity for re-growth than older and
    higher animals, it would also appear that they retain cells in a
    nascent state, or partially developed gemmules, more readily than
    do animals which have already passed through a long series of
    developmental changes. I may here add that although ovules can be
    detected in most or all female animals at an extremely early age,
    there is no reason to doubt that gemmules derived from parts
    modified during maturity can pass into the ovules.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to hybridism, pangenesis agrees
    well with most of the ascertained facts. We must believe, as
    previously shown, that several gemmules are requisite for the
    development of each cell or unit. But from the occurrence of
    parthenogenesis, more especially from those cases in which an
    embryo is only partially formed, we may infer that the female
    element generally includes gemmules in nearly sufficient number for
    independent development, so that when united with the male element
    the gemmules are superabundant. Now, when two species or races are
    crossed reciprocally, the offspring do not commonly differ, and
    this shows that the sexual elements agree in power, in accordance
    with the view that both include the same gemmules. Hybrids and
    mongrels are also generally intermediate in character between the
    two parent-forms, yet occasionally they closely resemble one parent
    in one part and the other parent in another part, or even in their
    whole structure: nor is this difficult to understand on the
    admission that the gemmules in the fertilised germ are
    superabundant in number, and that those derived from one parent may
    have some advantage in number, affinity, or vigour over those
    derived from the other parent. Crossed forms sometimes exhibit the
    colour or other characters of either parent in stripes or blotches;
    and this occurs in the first generation, or through reversion in
    succeeding bud and seminal generations, of which fact several
    instances were given in the eleventh chapter. In these cases we
    must follow Naudin<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> and admit that
    the "essence" or "element" of the two species,&#8212;terms which I
    should translate into the gemmules,&#8212;have an affinity for
    their own kind, and thus separate themselves into distinct stripes
    or blotches; and reasons were given, when discussing in the
    fifteenth chapter the incompatibility of certain characters to
    unite, for believing in such mutual affinity. When two forms are
    crossed, one is not rarely found to be prepotent in the
    transmission of its characters over the other; and this we can
    explain by again assuming that the one form has some advantage over
    the other in the number, vigour, or affinity of its gemmules. In
    some cases, however, certain characters are present in the one form
    and latent in the other; for instance, there is a latent tendency
    in all pigeons to become blue, and, when a blue pigeon is crossed
    with one of any other colour, the blue tint is generally prepotent.
    The explanation of this form of prepotency will be obvious when we
    come to the consideration of Reversion.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When two distinct species are crossed, it is
    notorious that they do not yield the full or proper number of
    offspring; and we can only say on this head that, as the
    development of each organism depends on such nicely-balanced
    affinities between a host of gemmules and nascent cells, we need
    not feel at all surprised that the commixture of gemmules derived
    from two distinct species should lead to partial or complete
    failure of development. With respect to the sterility of hybrids
    produced from the union of two distinct species, it was shown in
    the nineteenth chapter that this depends exclusively on the
    reproductive organs being specially affected; but why these organs
    should be thus affected we do not know, any more than why unnatural
    conditions of life, though compatible with health, should cause
    sterility; or why continued close interbreeding, or the
    illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants, induce the same result.
    The conclusion that the reproductive organs alone are affected, and
    not the whole organisation, agrees perfectly with the unimpaired or
    even increased capacity in hybrid plants for propagation by buds;
    for this implies, according to our hypothesis, that the cells of
    the hybrids throw off hybridised gemmules, which become aggregated
    into buds, but fail to become aggregated within the reproductive
    organs, so as to form the sexual elements. In a similar manner many
    plants, when placed under unnatural conditions, fail to produce
    seed, but can readily be propagated by buds. We shall presently see
    that pangenesis agrees well with the strong tendency to reversion
    exhibited by all crossed animals and plants.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Each organism reaches maturity through a longer
    or shorter course of growth and development: the former term being
    confined to mere increase of size, and development to changed
    structure. The changes may be small and insensibly slow, as when a
    child grows into a man, or many, abrupt, and slight, as in the
    metamorphoses of certain ephemerous insects, or, again, few and
    strongly-marked, as with most other insects. Each newly formed part
    may be moulded within a previously existing and corresponding part,
    and in this case it will appear, falsely as I believe, to be
    developed from the old part; or it may be formed within a distinct
    part of the body, as in the extreme cases of metagenesis. An eye,
    for instance, may be developed at a spot where no eye previously
    existed. We have also seen that allied organic beings in the course
    of their metamorphoses sometimes attain nearly the same structure
    after passing through widely different forms; or conversely, after
    passing through nearly the same early forms, arrive at widely
    different mature forms. In these cases it is very difficult to
    accept the common view that the first-formed cells or units possess
    the inherent power, independently of any external agency, of
    producing new structures wholly different in form, position, and
    function. But all these cases become plain on the hypothesis of
    pangenesis. The units, during each stage of development, throw off
    gemmules, which, multiplying, are transmitted to the offspring. In
    the offspring, as soon as any particular cell or unit becomes
    partially developed, it unites with (or, to speak metaphorically,
    is fertilised by) the gemmule of the next succeeding cell, and so
    onwards. But organisms have often been subjected to changed
    conditions of life at a certain stage of their development, and in
    consequence have been slightly modified; and the gemmules cast off
    from such modified parts will tend to reproduce parts modified in
    the same manner. This process may be repeated until the structure
    of the part becomes greatly changed at one particular stage of
    development, but this will not necessarily affect other parts,
    whether previously or subsequently formed. In this manner we can
    understand the remarkable independence of structure in the
    successive metamorphoses, and especially in the successive
    metageneses of many animals. In the case, however, of diseases
    which supervene during old age, subsequently to the ordinary period
    of procreation, and which, nevertheless, are sometimes inherited,
    as occurs with brain and heart complaints, we must suppose that the
    organs were affected at an early age and threw off at this period
    affected gemmules; but that the affection became visible or
    injurious only after the prolonged growth, in the strict sense of
    the word, of the part. In all the changes of structure which
    regularly supervene during old age, we probably see the effects of
    deteriorated growth, and not of true development.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The principle of the independent formation of
    each part, owing to the union of the proper gemmules with certain
    nascent cells, together with the superabundance of the gemmules
    derived from both parents, and the subsequent self-multiplication
    of the gemmules, throws light on a widely different group of facts,
    which on any ordinary view of development appears very strange. I
    allude to organs which are abnormally transposed or multiplied. For
    instance, a curious case has been recorded by Dr. Elliott Coues<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> of a monstrous chicken with a
    perfect additional <I>right</I> leg articulated to the <I>left</I>
    side of the pelvis. Gold-fish often have supernumerary fins placed
    on various parts of their bodies. When the tail of a lizard is
    broken off, a double tail is sometimes reproduced; and when the
    foot of the salamander was divided longitudinally by Bonnet,
    additional digits were occasionally formed. Valentin injured the
    caudal extremity of an embryo, and three days afterwards it
    produced rudiments of a double pelvis and of double hind-limbs.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> When frogs, toads, etc., are born
    with their limbs doubled, as sometimes happens, the doubling, as
    Gervais remarks,<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> cannot be due to
    the complete fusion of two embryos, with the exception of the
    limbs, for the larv&#230; are limbless. The same argument is
    applicable<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> to certain insects
    produced with multiple legs or antenn&#230;, for these are
    metamorphosed from apodal or antenn&#230;-less larv&#230;. Alphonse
    Milne-Edwards<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> has described the
    curious case of a crustacean in which one eye-peduncle supported,
    instead of a complete eye, only an imperfect cornea, and out of the
    centre of this a portion of an antenna was developed. A case has
    been recorded<A href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> of a man who had
    during both dentitions a double tooth in place of the left second
    incisor, and he inherited this peculiarity from his paternal
    grandfather. Several cases are known<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> of additional teeth having been
    developed in the orbit of the eye, and, more especially with
    horses, in the palate. Hairs occasionally appear in strange
    situations, as "within the substance of the brain."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> Certain breeds of sheep bear a whole
    crowd of horns on their foreheads. As many as five spurs have been
    seen on both legs of certain Game-fowls. In the Polish fowl the
    male is ornamented with a topknot of hackles like those on his
    neck, whilst the female has a top-knot formed of common feathers.
    In feather-footed pigeons and fowls, feathers like those on the
    wing arise from the outer side of the legs and toes. Even the
    elemental parts of the same feather may be transposed; for in the
    Sebastopol goose, barbules are developed on the divided filaments
    of the shaft. Imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps of the
    amputated fingers of man<A href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> and it
    is an interesting fact that with the snake-like Saurians, which
    present a series with more and more imperfect limbs, the
    terminations of the phalanges first disappear, "the nails becoming
    transferred to their proximal remnants, or even to parts which are
    not phalanges."<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Analogous cases are of such frequent occurrence
    with plants that they do not strike us with sufficient surprise.
    Supernumerary petals, stamens, and pistils, are often produced. I
    have seen a leaflet low down in the compound leaf of <I>Vicia
    sativa</I> replaced by a tendril; and a tendril possesses many
    peculiar properties, such as spontaneous movement and irritability.
    The calyx sometimes assumes, either wholly or by stripes, the
    colour and texture of the corolla. Stamens are so frequently
    converted into petals, more or less completely, that such cases are
    passed over as not deserving notice; but as petals have special
    functions to perform, namely, to protect the included organs, to
    attract insects, and in not a few cases to guide their entrance by
    well-adapted contrivances, we can hardly account for the conversion
    of stamens into petals merely by unnatural or superfluous
    nourishment. Again, the edge of a petal may occasionally be found
    including one of the highest products of the plant, namely, pollen;
    for instance, I have seen the pollen-mass of an Ophrys, which is a
    very complex structure, developed in the edge of an upper petal.
    The segments of the calyx of the common pea have been observed
    partially converted into carpels, including ovules, and with their
    tips converted into stigmas. Mr. Salter and Dr. Maxwell Masters
    have found pollen within the ovules of the passion-flower and of
    the rose. Buds may be developed in the most unnatural positions, as
    on the petal of a flower. Numerous analogous facts could be
    given.<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I do not know how physiologists look at such
    facts as the foregoing. According to the doctrine of pangenesis,
    the gemmules of the transposed organs become developed in the wrong
    place, from uniting with wrong cells or aggregates of cells during
    their nascent state; and this would follow from a slight
    modification in their elective affinities. Nor ought we to feel
    much surprise at the affinities of cells and gemmules varying, when
    we remember the many curious cases given in the seventeenth
    chapter, of plants which absolutely refuse to be fertilised by
    their own pollen, though abundantly fertile with that of any other
    individual of the same species, and in some cases only with that of
    a distinct species. It is manifest that the sexual elective
    affinities of such plants&#8212;to use the term employed by
    G&#228;rtner&#8212;have been modified. As the cells of adjoining or
    homologous parts will have nearly the same nature, they will be
    particularly liable to acquire by variation each other's elective
    affinities; and we can thus understand to a certain extent such
    cases as a crowd of horns on the heads of certain sheep, of several
    spurs on the legs of fowls, hackle-like feathers on the heads of
    the males of other fowls, and with the pigeon wing-like feathers on
    their legs and membrane between their toes, for the leg is the
    homologue of the wing. As all the organs of plants are homologous
    and spring from a common axis, it is natural that they should be
    eminently liable to transposition. It ought to be observed that
    when any compound part, such as an additional limb or an antenna,
    springs from a false position, it is only necessary that the few
    first gemmules should be wrongly attached; for these whilst
    developing would attract other gemmules in due succession, as in
    the re-growth of an amputated limb. When parts which are homologous
    and similar in structure, as the vertebr&#230; of snakes or the
    stamens of polyandrous flowers, etc., are repeated many times in
    the same organism, closely allied gemmules must be extremely
    numerous, as well as the points to which they ought to become
    united; and, in accordance with the foregoing views, we can to a
    certain extent understand Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's law, that
    parts, which are already multiple, are extremely liable to vary in
    number.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Variability often depends, as I have attempted
    to show, on the reproductive organs being injuriously affected by
    changed conditions; and in this case the gemmules derived from the
    various parts of the body are probably aggregated in an irregular
    manner, some superfluous and others deficient. Whether a
    superabundance of gemmules would lead to the increased size of any
    part cannot be told; but we can see that their partial deficiency,
    without necessarily leading to the entire abortion of the part,
    might cause considerable modifications; for in the same manner as
    plants, if their own pollen be excluded, are easily hybridised, so,
    in the case of cells, if the properly succeeding gemmules were
    absent, they would probably combine easily with other and allied
    gemmules, as we have just seen with transposed parts.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In variations caused by the direct action of
    changed conditions, of which several instances have been given,
    certain parts of the body are directly affected by the new
    conditions, and consequently throw off modified gemmules, which are
    transmitted to the offspring. On any ordinary view it is
    unintelligible how changed conditions, whether acting on the
    embryo, the young or the adult, can cause inherited modifications.
    It is equally or even more unintelligible on any ordinary view, how
    the effects of the long-continued use or disuse of a part, or of
    changed habits of body or mind, can be inherited. A more perplexing
    problem can hardly be proposed; but on our view we have only to
    suppose that certain cells become at last structurally modified;
    and that these throw off similarly modified gemmules. This may
    occur at any period of development, and the modification will be
    inherited at a corresponding period; for the modified gemmules will
    unite in all ordinary cases with the proper preceding cells, and
    will consequently be developed at the same period at which the
    modification first arose. With respect to mental habits or
    instincts, we are so profoundly ignorant of the relation between
    the brain and the power of thought that we do not know positively
    whether a fixed habit induces any change in the nervous system,
    though this seems highly probable; but when such habit or other
    mental attribute, or insanity, is inherited, we must believe that
    some actual modification is transmitted;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> and this implies, according to our
    hypothesis, that gemmules derived from modified nerve-cells are
    transmitted to the offspring.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is generally necessary that an organism
    should be exposed during several generations to changed conditions
    or habits, in order that any modification thus acquired should
    appear in the offspring. This may be partly due to the changes not
    being at first marked enough to catch attention, but this
    explanation is insufficient; and I can account for the fact only by
    the assumption, which we shall see under the head of reversion is
    strongly supported, that gemmules derived from each unmodified unit
    or part are transmitted in large numbers to successive generations,
    and that the gemmules derived from the same unit after it has been
    modified go on multiplying under the same favourable conditions
    which first caused the modification, until at last they become
    sufficiently numerous to overpower and supplant the old
    gemmules.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A difficulty may be here noticed; we have seen
    that there is an important difference in the frequency, though not
    in the nature, of the variations in plants propagated by sexual and
    asexual generation. As far as variability depends on the imperfect
    action of the reproductive organs under changed conditions, we can
    at once see why plants propagated asexually should be far less
    variable than those propagated sexually. With respect to the direct
    action of changed conditions, we know that organisms produced from
    buds do not pass through the earlier phases of development; they
    will therefore not be exposed, at that period of life when
    structure is most readily modified, to the various causes inducing
    variability in the same manner as are embryos and young larval
    forms; but whether this is a sufficient explanation I know not.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to variations due to reversion,
    there is a similar difference between plants propagated from buds
    and seeds. Many varieties can be propagated securely by buds, but
    generally or invariably revert to their parent-forms by seed. So,
    also, hybridised plants can be multiplied to any extent by buds,
    but are continually liable to reversion by seed,&#8212;that is, to
    the loss of their hybrid or intermediate character. I can offer no
    satisfactory explanation of these facts. Plants with variegated
    leaves, phloxes with striped flowers, barberries with seedless
    fruit, can all be securely propagated by buds taken from the stem
    or branches; but buds from the roots of these plants almost
    invariably lose their character and revert to their former
    condition. This latter fact is also inexplicable, unless buds
    developed from the roots are as distinct from those on the stem, as
    is one bud on the stem from another, and we know that these latter
    behave like independent organisms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, we see that on the hypothesis of
    pangenesis variability depends on at least two distinct groups of
    causes. Firstly, the deficiency, superabundance, and transposition
    of gemmules, and the redevelopment of those which have long been
    dormant; the gemmules themselves not having undergone any
    modification; and such changes will amply account for much
    fluctuating variability. Secondly, the direct action of changed
    conditions on the organisation, and of the increased use or disuse
    of parts; and in this case the gemmules from the modified units
    will be themselves modified, and, when sufficiently multiplied,
    will supplant the old gemmules and be developed into new
    structures.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Turning now to the laws of Inheritance. If we
    suppose a homogeneous gelatinous protozoon to vary and assume a
    reddish colour, a minute separated particle would naturally, as it
    grew to full size, retain the same colour; and we should have the
    simplest form of inheritance.<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A>
    Precisely the same view may be extended to the infinitely numerous
    and diversified units of which the whole body of one of the higher
    animals is composed; the separated particles being our gemmules. We
    have already sufficiently discussed by implication, the important
    principle of inheritance at corresponding ages. Inheritance as
    limited by sex and by the season of the year (for instance with
    animals becoming white in winter) is intelligible if we may believe
    that the elective affinities of the units of the body are slightly
    different in the two sexes, especially at maturity, and in one or
    both sexes at different seasons, so that they unite with different
    gemmules. It should be remembered that, in the discussion on the
    abnormal transposition of organs, we have seen reason to believe
    that such elective affinities are readily modified. But I shall
    soon have to recur to sexual and seasonal inheritance. These
    several laws are therefore explicable to a large extent through
    pangenesis, and on no other hypothesis which has as yet been
    advanced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But it appears at first sight a fatal objection
    to our hypothesis that a part or organ may be removed during
    several successive generations, and if the operation be not
    followed by disease, the lost part reappears in the offspring. Dogs
    and horses formerly had their tails docked during many generations
    without any inherited effect; although, as we have seen, there is
    some reason to believe that the tailless condition of certain
    sheep-dogs is due to such inheritance. Circumcision has been
    practised by the Jews from a remote period, and in most cases the
    effects of the operation are not visible in the offspring; though
    some maintain that an inherited effect does occasionally appear. If
    inheritance depends on the presence of disseminated gemmules
    derived from all the units of the body, why does not the amputation
    or mutilation of a part, especially if effected on both sexes,
    invariably affect the offspring? The answer in accordance with our
    hypothesis probably is that gemmules multiply and are transmitted
    during a long series of generations&#8212;as we see in the
    reappearance of zebrine stripes on the horse&#8212;in the
    reappearance of muscles and other structures in man which are
    proper to his lowly organised progenitors, and in many other such
    cases. Therefore the long-continued inheritance of a part which has
    been removed during many generations is no real anomaly, for
    gemmules formerly derived from the part are multiplied and
    transmitted from generation to generation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have as yet spoken only of the removal of
    parts, when not followed by morbid action: but when the operation
    is thus followed, it is certain that the deficiency is sometimes
    inherited. In a former chapter instances were given, as of a cow,
    the loss of whose horn was followed by suppuration, and her calves
    were destitute of a horn on the same side of their heads. But the
    evidence which admits of no doubt is that given by
    Brown-S&#233;quard with respect to guinea-pigs, which after their
    sciatic nerves had been divided, gnawed off their own gangrenous
    toes, and the toes of their offspring were deficient in at least
    thirteen instances on the corresponding feet. The inheritance of
    the lost part in several of these cases is all the more remarkable
    as only one parent was affected; but we know that a congenital
    deficiency is often transmitted from one parent alone&#8212;for
    instance, the offspring of hornless cattle of either sex, when
    crossed with perfect animals, are often hornless. How, then, in
    accordance with our hypothesis can we account for mutilations being
    sometimes strongly inherited, if they are followed by diseased
    action? The answer probably is that all the gemmules of the
    mutilated or amputated part are gradually attracted to the diseased
    surface during the reparative process, and are there destroyed by
    the morbid action.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A few words must be added on the complete
    abortion of organs. When a part becomes diminished by disuse
    prolonged during many generations, the principle of economy of
    growth, together with intercrossing, will tend to reduce it still
    further as previously explained, but this will not account for the
    complete or almost complete obliteration of, for instance, a minute
    papilla of cellular tissue representing a pistil, or of a
    microscopically minute nodule of bone representing a tooth. In
    certain cases of suppression not yet completed, in which a rudiment
    occasionally reappears through reversion, dispersed gemmules
    derived from this part must, according to our view, still exist; we
    must therefore suppose that the cells, in union with which the
    rudiment was formerly developed, fail in their affinity for such
    gemmules, except in the occasional cases of reversion. But when the
    abortion is complete and final, the gemmules themselves no doubt
    perish; nor is this in any way improbable, for, though a vast
    number of active and long-dormant gemmules are nourished in each
    living creature, yet there must be some limit to their number; and
    it appears natural that gemmules derived from reduced and useless
    parts would be more liable to perish than those freshly derived
    from other parts which are still in full functional activity.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The last subject that need be discussed, namely,
    Reversion, rests on the principle that transmission and
    development, though generally acting in conjunction, are distinct
    powers; and the transmission of gemmules with their subsequent
    development shows us how this is possible. We plainly see the
    distinction in the many cases in which a grandfather transmits to
    his grandson, through his daughter, characters which she does not,
    or cannot, possess. But before proceeding, it will be advisable to
    say a few words about latent or dormant characters. Most, or
    perhaps all, of the secondary characters, which appertain to one
    sex, lie dormant in the other sex; that is, gemmules capable of
    development into the secondary male sexual characters are included
    within the female; and conversely female characters in the male: we
    have evidence of this in certain masculine characters, both
    corporeal and mental, appearing in the female, when her ovaria are
    diseased or when they fail to act from old age. In like manner
    female characters appear in castrated males, as in the shape of the
    horns of the ox, and in the absence of horns in castrated stags.
    Even a slight change in the conditions of life due to confinement
    sometimes suffices to prevent the development of masculine
    characters in male animals, although their reproductive organs are
    not permanently injured. In the many cases in which masculine
    characters are periodically renewed, these are latent at other
    seasons; inheritance as limited by sex and season being here
    combined. Again, masculine characters generally lie dormant in male
    animals until they arrive at the proper age for reproduction. The
    curious case formerly given of a Hen which assumed the masculine
    characters, not of her own breed but of a remote progenitor,
    illustrates the close connection between latent sexual characters
    and ordinary reversion.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With those animals and plants which habitually
    produce several forms, as with certain butterflies described by Mr.
    Wallace, in which three female forms and one male form co-exist,
    or, as with the trimorphic species of Lythrum and Oxalis, gemmules
    capable of reproducing these different forms must be latent in each
    individual.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Insects are occasionally produced with one side
    or one quarter of their bodies like that of the male, with the
    other half or three-quarters like that of the female. In such cases
    the two sides are sometimes wonderfully different in structure, and
    are separated from each other by a sharp line. As gemmules derived
    from every part are present in each individual of both sexes, it
    must be the elective affinities of the nascent cells which in these
    cases differ abnormally on the two sides of the body. Almost the
    same principle comes into play with those animals, for instance,
    certain gasteropods and Verruca amongst cirripedes, which normally
    have the two sides of the body constructed on a very different
    plan; and yet a nearly equal number of individuals have either side
    modified in the same remarkable manner.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Reversion, in the ordinary sense of the word,
    acts so incessantly, that it evidently forms an essential part of
    the general law of inheritance. It occurs with beings, however
    propagated, whether by buds or seminal generation, and sometimes
    may be observed with advancing age even in the same individual. The
    tendency to reversion is often induced by a change of conditions,
    and in the plainest manner by crossing. Crossed forms of the first
    generation are generally nearly intermediate in character between
    their two parents; but in the next generation the offspring
    commonly revert to one or both of their grandparents, and
    occasionally to more remote ancestors. How can we account for these
    facts? Each unit in a hybrid must throw off, according to the
    doctrine of pangenesis, an abundance of hybridised gemmules, for
    crossed plants can be readily and largely propagated by buds; but
    by the same hypothesis dormant gemmules derived from both pure
    parent-forms are likewise present; and as these gemmules retain
    their normal condition, they would, it is probable, be enabled to
    multiply largely during the lifetime of each hybrid. Consequently
    the sexual elements of a hybrid will include both pure and
    hybridised gemmules; and when two hybrids pair, the combination of
    pure gemmules derived from the one hybrid with the pure gemmules of
    the same parts derived from the other, would necessarily lead to
    complete reversion of character; and it is, perhaps, not too bold a
    supposition that unmodified and undeteriorated gemmules of the same
    nature would be especially apt to combine. Pure gemmules in
    combination with hybridised gemmules would lead to partial
    reversion. And lastly, hybridised gemmules derived from both
    parent-hybrids would simply reproduce the original hybrid form.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> All these cases and degrees of
    reversion incessantly occur.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It was shown in the fifteenth chapter that
    certain characters are antagonistic to each other or do not readily
    blend; hence, when two animals with antagonistic characters are
    crossed, it might well happen that a sufficiency of gemmules in the
    male alone for the reproduction of his peculiar characters, and in
    the female alone for the reproduction of her peculiar characters,
    would not be present; and in this case dormant gemmules derived
    from the same part in some remote progenitor might easily gain the
    ascendancy, and cause the reappearance of the long-lost character.
    For instance, when black and white pigeons, or black and white
    fowls, are crossed,&#8212;colours which do not readily
    blend,&#8212;blue plumage in the one case, evidently derived from
    the rock-pigeon, and red plumage in the other case, derived from
    the wild jungle-cock, occasionally reappear. With uncrossed breeds
    the same result follows, under conditions which favour the
    multiplication and development of certain dormant gemmules, as when
    animals become feral and revert to their pristine character. A
    certain number of gemmules being requisite for the development of
    each character, as is known to be the case from several spermatozoa
    or pollen-grains being necessary for fertilisation, and time
    favouring their multiplication, will perhaps account for the
    curious cases, insisted on by Mr. Sedgwick, of certain diseases
    which regularly appear in alternate generations. This likewise
    holds good, more or less strictly, with other weakly inherited
    modifications. Hence, as I have heard it remarked, certain diseases
    appear to gain strength by the intermission of a generation. The
    transmission of dormant gemmules during many successive generations
    is hardly in itself more improbable, as previously remarked, than
    the retention during many ages of rudimentary organs, or even only
    of a tendency to the production of a rudiment; but there is no
    reason to suppose that dormant gemmules can be transmitted and
    propagated for ever. Excessively minute and numerous as they are
    believed to be, an infinite number derived, during a long course of
    modification and descent, from each unit of each progenitor, could
    not be supported or nourished by the organism. But it does not seem
    improbable that certain gemmules, under favourable conditions,
    should be retained and go on multiplying for a much longer period
    than others. Finally, on the view here given, we certainly gain
    some insight into the wonderful fact that the child may depart from
    the type of both its parents, and resemble its grandparents, or
    ancestors removed by many hundreds of generations.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Conclusion.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The hypothesis of Pangenesis, as applied to the
    several great classes of facts just discussed, no doubt is
    extremely complex, but so are the facts. The chief assumption is
    that all the units of the body, besides having the universally
    admitted power of growing by self-division, throw off minute
    gemmules which are dispersed through the system. Nor can this
    assumption be considered as too bold, for we know from the cases of
    graft-hybridisation that formative matter of some kind is present
    in the tissues of plants, which is capable of combining with that
    included in another individual, and of reproducing every unit of
    the whole organism. But we have further to assume that the gemmules
    grow, multiply, and aggregate themselves into buds and the sexual
    elements; their development depending on their union with other
    nascent cells or units. They are also believed to be capable of
    transmission in a dormant state, like seeds in the ground, to
    successive generations.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In a highly-organised animal, the gemmules
    thrown off from each different unit throughout the body must be
    inconceivably numerous and minute. Each unit of each part, as it
    changes during development, and we know that some insects undergo
    at least twenty metamorphoses, must throw off its gemmules. But the
    same cells may long continue to increase by self-division, and even
    become modified by absorbing peculiar nutriment, without
    necessarily throwing off modified gemmules. All organic beings,
    moreover, include many dormant gemmules derived from their
    grandparents and more remote progenitors, but not from all their
    progenitors. These almost infinitely numerous and minute gemmules
    are contained within each bud, ovule, spermatozoon, and
    pollen-grain. Such an admission will be declared impossible; but
    number and size are only relative difficulties. Independent
    organisms exist which are barely visible under the highest powers
    of the microscope, and their germs must be excessively minute.
    Particles of infectious matter, so small as to be wafted by the
    wind or to adhere to smooth paper, will multiply so rapidly as to
    infect within a short time the whole body of a large animal. We
    should also reflect on the admitted number and minuteness of the
    molecules composing a particle of ordinary matter. The difficulty,
    therefore, which at first appears insurmountable, of believing in
    the existence of gemmules so numerous and small as they must be
    according to our hypothesis, has no great weight.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The units of the body are generally admitted by
    physiologists to be autonomous. I go one step further and assume
    that they throw off reproductive gemmules. Thus an organism does
    not generate its kind as a whole, but each separate unit generates
    its kind. It has often been said by naturalists that each cell of a
    plant has the potential capacity of reproducing the whole plant;
    but it has this power only in virtue of containing gemmules derived
    from every part. When a cell or unit is from some cause modified,
    the gemmules derived from it will be in like manner modified. If
    our hypothesis be provisionally accepted, we must look at all the
    forms of asexual reproduction, whether occurring at maturity or
    during youth, as fundamentally the same, and dependent on the
    mutual aggregation and multiplication of the gemmules. The
    re-growth of an amputated limb and the healing of a wound is the
    same process partially carried out. Buds apparently include nascent
    cells, belonging to that stage of development at which the budding
    occurs, and these cells are ready to unite with the gemmules
    derived from the next succeeding cells. The sexual elements, on the
    other hand, do not include such nascent cells; and the male and
    female elements taken separately do not contain a sufficient number
    of gemmules for independent development, except in the cases of
    parthenogenesis. The development of each being, including all the
    forms of metamorphosis and metagenesis, depends on the presence of
    gemmules thrown off at each period of life, and on their
    development, at a corresponding period, in union with preceding
    cells. Such cells may be said to be fertilised by the gemmules
    which come next in due order of development. Thus the act of
    ordinary impregnation and the development of each part in each
    being are closely analogous processes. The child, strictly
    speaking, does not grow into the man, but includes germs which
    slowly and successively become developed and form the man. In the
    child, as well as in the adult, each part generates the same part.
    Inheritance must be looked at as merely a form of growth, like the
    self-division of a lowly-organised unicellular organism. Reversion
    depends on the transmission from the forefather to his descendants
    of dormant gemmules, which occasionally become developed under
    certain known or unknown conditions. Each animal and plant may be
    compared with a bed of soil full of seeds, some of which soon
    germinate, some lie dormant for a period, whilst others perish.
    When we hear it said that a man carries in his constitution the
    seeds of an inherited disease, there is much truth in the
    expression. No other attempt, as far as I am aware, has been made,
    imperfect as this confessedly is, to connect under one point of
    view these several grand classes of facts. An organic being is a
    microcosm&#8212;a little universe, formed of a host of
    self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute and numerous as
    the stars in heaven.</P>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">This hypothesis has been severely criticised by many writers,
      and it will be fair to give references to the more important
      articles. The best essay which I have seen is by Prof. Delpino,
      entitled 'Sulla Darwiniana Teoria della Pangenesi, 1869,' of
      which a translation appeared in 'Scientific Opinion,' Sept. 29th,
      1869, and the succeeding numbers. He rejects the hypothesis, but
      criticises it fairly, and I have found his criticisms very
      useful. Mr. Mivart ('Genesis of Species,' 1871, chap. x.) follows
      Delpino, but adds no new objections of any weight. Dr. Bastian
      ('The Beginnings of Life,' 1872, vol. ii. p. 98) says that the
      hypothesis "looks like a relic of the old rather than a fitting
      appanage of the new evolution philosophy." He shows that I ought
      not to have used the term "pangenesis," as it had been previously
      used by Dr. Gros in another sense. Dr. Lionel Beale ('Nature,'
      May 11th, 1871, p. 26) sneers at the whole doctrine with much
      acerbity and some justice. Prof. Wigand ('Schriften der Gesell.
      der gesammt. Naturwissen. zu Marburg,' B. ix. 1870) considers the
      hypothesis as unscientific and worthless. Mr. G. H. Lewes
      ('Fortnightly Review,' Nov. 1st, 1868, p. 503) seems to consider
      that it may be useful: he makes many good criticisms in a
      perfectly fair spirit. Mr. F. Galton, after describing his
      valuable experiments ('Proc. Royal Soc.,' vol. xix. p. 393) on
      the intertransfusion of the blood of distinct varieties of the
      rabbit, concludes by saying that in his opinion the results
      negative beyond all doubt the doctrine of Pangenesis. He informs
      me that subsequently to the publication of his paper he continued
      his experiments on a still larger scale for two more generations,
      without any sign of mongrelism showing itself in the very
      numerous offspring. I certainly should have expected that
      gemmules would have been present in the blood, but this is no
      necessary part of the hypothesis, which manifestly applies to
      plants and the lowest animals. Mr. Galton, in a letter to
      'Nature' (April 27th, 1871, p. 502), also criticises various
      incorrect expressions used by me. On the other hand, several
      writers have spoken favourably of the hypothesis, but there would
      be no use in giving references to their articles. I may, however,
      refer to Dr. Ross' work, 'The Graft Theory of Disease; being an
      application of Mr. Darwin's hypothesis of Pangenesis,' 1872, as
      he gives several original and ingenious discussions.</FONT></LI>

      506) remarks on the number of writers who have advanced nearly
      similar views. More than two thousand years ago Aristotle
      combated a view of this kind, which, as I hear from Dr. W. Ogle,
      was held by Hippocrates and others. Ray, in his 'Wisdom of God'
      (2nd edit., 1692, p. 68), says that "every part of the body seems
      to club and contribute to the seed." The "organic molecules" of
      Buffon ('Hist. Nat. Gen.,' edit. of 1749, tom. ii., pp. 54, 62,
      329, 333, 420, 425) appear at first sight to be the same as the
      gemmules of my hypothesis, but they are essentially different.
      Bonnet ('&#338;uvres d'Hist. Nat.,' tom. v., part i., 1781, 4to
      edit., p. 334) speaks of the limbs having germs adapted for the
      reparation of all possible losses; but whether these germs are
      supposed to be the same with those within buds and the sexual
      organs is not clear. Prof. Owen says ('Anatomy of Vertebrates,'
      vol. iii., 1868, p. 813) that he fails to see any fundamental
      difference between the views which he propounded in his
      'Parthenogenesis' (1849, pp. 5-8), and which he now considers as
      erroneous, and my hypothesis of pangenesis: but a reviewer
      ('Journal of Anat. and Phys.,' May 1869, p. 441) shows how
      different they really are. I formerly thought that the
      "physiological units" of Herbert Spencer ('Principles of
      Biology,' vol. i., chaps. iv. and viii., 1863-64) were the same
      as my gemmules, but I now know that this is not the case. Lastly,
      it appears from a review of the present work by Prof. Mantegazza
      ('Nuova Antologia, Maggio,' 1868), that he (in his 'Elementi di
      Igiene,' Ediz. iii., p. 540) clearly foresaw the doctrine of
      pangenesis.</FONT></LI>
