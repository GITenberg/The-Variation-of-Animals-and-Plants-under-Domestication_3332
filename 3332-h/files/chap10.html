    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>The Vine (Vitis
    vinifera).</I>&#8212;The best authorities consider all our grapes
    as the descendants of one species which now grows wild in western
    Asia, which grew wild during the Bronze age in Italy,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and which has recently been found fossil
    in a tufaceous deposit in the south of France.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Some authors, however, entertain much
    doubt about the single parentage of our cultivated varieties, owing
    to the number of semi-wild forms found in Southern Europe,
    especially as described by Clemente<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> in a forest in Spain; but as the grape
    sows itself freely in Southern Europe, and as several of the chief
    kinds transmit their characters by seed,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> whilst others are extremely variable, the
    existence of many different escaped forms could hardly fail to
    occur in countries where this plant has been cultivated from the
    remotest antiquity. That the vine varies much when propagated by
    seed, we may infer from the largely increased number of varieties
    since the earlier historical records. New hot-house varieties are
    produced almost every year; for instance,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> a golden-coloured variety has been
    recently raised in England from a black grape without the aid of a
    cross. Van Mons<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> reared a multitude
    of varieties from the seed of one vine, which was completely
    separated from all others, so that there could not, at least in
    this generation, have been any crossing, and the seedlings
    presented "les analogues de toutes les sortes," and differed in
    almost every possible character both in the fruits and
    foliage.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The cultivated varieties are extremely
    numerous; Count Odart says that he will not deny that there may
    exist throughout the world 700 or 800, perhaps even 1000 varieties,
    but not a third of these have any value. In the catalogue of fruit
    cultivated in the Horticultural Gardens of London, published in
    1842, 99 varieties are enumerated. Wherever the grape is grown many
    varieties occur: Pallas describes 24 in the Crimea, and Burnes
    mentions 10 in Cabool. The classification of the varieties has much
    perplexed writers, and Count Odart is reduced to a geographical
    system; but I will not enter on this subject, nor on the many and
    great differences between the varieties. I will merely specify a
    few curious and trifling peculiarities, all taken from Odart's
    highly esteemed work<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> for the sake
    of showing the diversified variability of this plant. Simon has
    classed grapes into two main divisions, those with downy leaves,
    and those with smooth leaves, but he admits that in one variety,
    namely the Rebazo, the leaves are either smooth, or downy; and
    Odart (p. 70) states that some varieties have the nerves alone, and
    other varieties their young leaves, downy, whilst the old ones are
    smooth. The Pedro-Ximenes grape (Odart, p. 397) presents a
    peculiarity by which it can be at once recognised amongst a host of
    other varieties, namely, that when the fruit is nearly ripe the
    nerves of the leaves or even the whole surface becomes yellow. The
    Barbera d'Asti is well marked by several characters (p. 426),
    amongst others, "by some of the leaves, and it is always the lowest
    on the branches, suddenly becoming of a dark red colour." Several
    authors in classifying grapes have founded their main divisions on
    the berries being either round or oblong; and Odart admits the
    value of this character; yet there is one variety, the Maccabeo (p.
    71), which often produces small round, and large oblong, berries in
    the same bunch. Certain grapes called Nebbiolo (p. 429) present a
    constant character, sufficient for their recognition, namely, "the
    slight adherence of that part of the pulp which surrounds the seeds
    to the rest of the berry, when cut through transversely." A Rhenish
    variety is mentioned (p. 228) which likes a dry soil; the fruit
    ripens well, but at the moment of maturity, if much rain falls, the
    berries are apt to rot; on the other hand, the fruit of a Swiss
    variety (p. 243) is valued for well sustaining prolonged humidity.
    This latter variety sprouts late in the spring, yet matures its
    fruit early; other varieties (page 362) have the fault of being too
    much excited by the April sun, and in consequence suffer from
    frost. A Styrian variety (p. 254) has brittle foot-stalks, so that
    the clusters of fruit are often blown off; this variety is said to
    be particularly attractive to wasps and bees. Other varieties have
    tough stalks, which resist the wind. Many other variable characters
    could be given, but the foregoing facts are sufficient to show in
    how many small structural and constitutional details the vine
    varies. During the vine disease in France certain old groups of
    varieties<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> have suffered far more
    from mildew than others. Thus "the group of Chasselas, so rich in
    varieties, did not afford a single fortunate exception;" certain
    other groups suffered much less; the true old Burgundy, for
    instance, was comparatively free from disease, and the Carminat
    likewise resisted the attack. The American vines, which belong to a
    distinct species, entirely escaped the disease in France; and we
    thus see that those European varieties which best resist the
    disease must have acquired in a slight degree the same
    constitutional peculiarities as the American species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>White Mulberry (Morus
    alba).</I>&#8212;I mention this plant because it has varied in
    certain characters, namely, in the texture and quality of the
    leaves, fitting them to serve as food for the domesticated
    silkworm, in a manner not observed with other plants; but this has
    arisen simply from such variations in the mulberry having been
    attended to, selected, and rendered more or less constant. M. de
    Quatrefages<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> briefly describes six
    kinds cultivated in one valley in France: of these the <I>
    amourouso</I> produces excellent leaves, but is rapidly being
    abandoned because it produces much fruit mingled with the leaves:
    the <I>antofino</I> yields deeply cut leaves of the finest quality,
    but not in great quantity: the <I>claro</I> is much sought for
    because the leaves can be easily collected: lastly, the <I>roso</I>
    bears strong hardy leaves, produced in large quantity, but with the
    one inconvenience, that they are best adapted for the worms after
    their fourth moult. MM. Jacquemet-Bonnefont, of Lyon, however,
    remark in their catalogue (1862) that two sub-varieties have been
    confounded under the name of the roso, one having leaves too thick
    for the caterpillars, the other being valuable because the leaves
    can easily be gathered from the branches without the bark being
    torn.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In India the mulberry has also given rise
    to many varieties. The Indian form is thought by many botanists to
    be a distinct species; but as Royle remarks,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> "so many varieties have been produced by
    cultivation that it is difficult to ascertain whether they all
    belong to one species;" they are, as he adds, nearly as numerous as
    those of the silkworm.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>The Orange Group.</I>&#8212;We here
    meet with great confusion in the specific distinction and parentage
    of the several kinds. Gallesio,<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
    who almost devoted his life-time to the subject, considers that
    there are four species, namely, sweet and bitter oranges, lemons,
    and citrons, each of which has given rise to whole groups of
    varieties, monsters, and supposed hybrids. One high authority<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> believes that these four reputed
    species are all varieties of the wild <I>Citrus medica,</I> but
    that the shaddock (<I>Citrus decumana</I>), which is not known in a
    wild state, is a distinct species; though its distinctness is
    doubted by another writer "of great authority on such matters,"
    namely, Dr. Buchanan Hamilton. Alph. De Candolle,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> on the other hand&#8212;and there cannot
    be a more capable judge&#8212;advances what he considers sufficient
    evidence of the orange (he doubts whether the bitter and sweet
    kinds are specifically distinct), the lemon, and citron, having
    been found wild, and consequently that they are distinct. He
    mentions two other forms cultivated in Japan and Java, which he
    ranks undoubted species; he speaks rather more doubtfully about the
    shaddock, which varies much, and has not been found wild; and
    finally he considers some forms, such as Adam's apple and the
    bergamotte, as probably hybrids.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have briefly abstracted these opinions
    for the sake of showing those who have never attended to such
    subjects, how perplexing they are. It would, therefore, be useless
    for my purpose to give a sketch of the conspicuous differences
    between the several forms. Besides the ever-recurrent difficulty of
    determining whether forms found wild are truly aboriginal or are
    escaped seedlings, many of the forms, which must be ranked as
    varieties, transmit their characters almost perfectly by seed.
    Sweet and bitter oranges differ in no important respect except in
    the flavour of their fruit, but Gallesio<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> is most emphatic that both kinds can be
    propagated by seed with absolute certainty. Consequently, in
    accordance with his simple rule, he classes them as distinct
    species; as he does sweet and bitter almonds, the peach and
    nectarine, etc. He admits, however, that the soft-shelled pine-tree
    produces not only soft-shelled but some hard-shelled seedlings, so
    that a little greater force in the power of inheritance would,
    according to this rule, raise a soft-shelled pine-tree into the
    dignity of an aboriginally created species. The positive assertion
    made by Macfayden<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> that the pips
    of sweet oranges produced in Jamaica, according to the nature of
    the soil in which they are sown, either sweet or bitter oranges, is
    probably an error; for M. Alph. De Candolle informs me that since
    the publication of his great work he has received accounts from
    Guiana, the Antilles, and Mauritius, that in these countries sweet
    oranges faithfully transmit their character. Gallesio found that
    the willow-leafed and the Little China oranges reproduced their
    proper leaves and fruit; but the seedlings were not quite equal in
    merit to their parents. The red-fleshed orange, on the other hand,
    fails to reproduce itself. Gallesio also observed that the seeds of
    several other singular varieties all reproduced trees having a
    peculiar physiognomy, partly resembling their parent-forms. I can
    adduce another case: the myrtle leaved orange is ranked by all
    authors as a variety, but is very distinct in general aspect: in my
    father's greenhouse, during many years, it rarely yielded any
    fruit, but at last produced one; and a tree thus raised was
    identical with the parent-form.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Another and more serious difficulty in
    determining the rank of the several forms is that, according to
    Gallesio,<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> they largely intercross
    without artificial aid; thus he positively states that seeds taken
    from lemon-trees (<I>C. lemonum</I>) growing mingled with the
    citron (<I>C. medica</I>), which is generally considered as a
    distinct species, produced a graduated series of varieties between
    these two forms. Again, an Adam's apple was produced from the seed
    of a sweet orange, which grew close to lemons and citrons. But such
    facts hardly aid us in determining whether to rank these forms as
    species or varieties; for it is now known that undoubted species of
    Verbascum, Cistus, Primula, Salix, etc., frequently cross in a
    state of nature. If indeed it were proved that plants of the orange
    tribe raised from these crosses were even partially sterile, it
    would be a strong argument in favour of their rank as species.
    Gallesio asserts that this is the case; but he does not distinguish
    between sterility from hybridism and from the effects of culture;
    and he almost destroys the force of this statement by another<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> namely, that when he impregnated
    the flowers of the common orange with the pollen taken from
    undoubted <I>varieties</I> of the orange, monstrous fruits were
    produced, which included "little pulp, and had no seeds, or
    imperfect seeds."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In this tribe of plants we meet with
    instances of two highly remarkable facts in vegetable physiology:
    Gallesio<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> impregnated an orange
    with pollen from a lemon, and the fruit borne on the mother tree
    had a raised stripe of peel like that of a lemon both in colour and
    taste, but the pulp was like that of an orange and included only
    imperfect seeds. The possibility of pollen from one variety or
    species directly affecting the fruit produced by another variety of
    species, is a subject which I shall fully discuss in the following
    chapter.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The second remarkable fact is, that two
    supposed hybrids<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> (for their
    hybrid nature was not ascertained), between an orange and either a
    lemon or citron, produced on the same tree leaves, flowers, and
    fruit of both pure parent-forms, as well as of a mixed or crossed
    nature. A bud taken from any one of the branches and grafted on
    another tree produces either one of the pure kinds or a capricious
    tree reproducing the three kinds. Whether the sweet lemon, which
    includes within the same fruit segments of differently flavoured
    pulp,<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> is an analogous case, I
    know not. But to this subject I shall have to recur.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will conclude by giving from A. Risso<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> a short account of a very singular
    variety of the common orange. It is the <I>"citrus aurantium fructu
    variabili,"</I> which on the young shoots produces rounded-oval
    leaves spotted with yellow, borne on petioles with heart-shaped
    wings; when these leaves fall off, they are succeeded by longer and
    narrower leaves, with undulated margins, of a pale-green colour
    embroidered with yellow, borne on footstalks without wings. The
    fruit whilst young is pear-shaped, yellow, longitudinally striated,
    and sweet; but as it ripens, it becomes spherical, of a
    reddish-yellow, and bitter.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Peach and Nectarine (Amygdalus
    persica).</I>&#8212;The best authorities are nearly unanimous that
    the peach has never been found wild. It was introduced from Persia
    into Europe a little before the Christian era, and at this period
    few varieties existed. Alph. De Candolle,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> from the fact of the peach not having
    spread from Persia at an earlier period, and from its not having
    pure Sanscrit or Hebrew names, believes that it is not an
    aboriginal of Western Asia, but came from the <I>terra
    incognita</I> of China. The supposition, however, that the peach is
    a modified almond which acquired its present character at a
    comparatively late period, would, I presume, account for these
    facts; on the same principle that the nectarine, the offspring of
    the peach, has few native names, and became known in Europe at a
    still later period.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Andrew Knight,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> from finding that a seedling-tree,
    raised from a sweet almond fertilised by the pollen of a peach,
    yielded fruit quite like that of a peach, suspected that the
    peach-tree is a modified almond; and in this he has been followed
    by various authors.<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> A first-rate
    peach, almost globular in shape, formed of soft and sweet pulp,
    surrounding a hard, much furrowed, and slightly flattened stone,
    certainly differs greatly from an almond, with its soft, slightly
    furrowed, much flattened, and elongated stone, protected by a
    tough, greenish layer of bitter flesh. Mr. Bentham<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> has particularly called attention to the
    stone of the almond being so much more flattened than that of the
    peach. But in the several varieties of the almond, the stone
    differs greatly in the degree to which it is compressed, in size,
    shape, strength, and in the depth of the furrows, as may be seen in
    fig. 42 (Nos. 4 to 8) of such kinds as I have been able to collect.
    With peach-stones also (Nos. 1 to 3) the degree of compression and
    elongation is seen to vary; so that the stone of the Chinese
    Honey-peach (No. 3) is much more elongated and compressed than that
    of the (No. 8) Smyrna almond. Mr. Rivers, of Sawbridgeworth, to
    whom I am indebted for some of the specimens above figured, and who
    has had such great horticultural experience, has called my
    attention to several varieties which connect the almond and the
    peach. In France there is a variety called the Peach-Almond, which
    Mr. Rivers formerly cultivated, and which is correctly described in
    a French catalogue as being oval and swollen, with the aspect of a
    peach, including a hard stone surrounded by a fleshy covering,
    which is sometimes eatable.<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> A
    remarkable statement by M. Luizet has recently appeared in the
    'Revue Horticole,'<A href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> namely, that a
    Peach-almond, grafted on a peach, bore, during 1863 and 1864
    almonds alone, but in 1865 bore six peaches and no almonds. M.
    Carriere, in commenting on this fact, cites the case of a
    double-flowered almond which, after producing during several years
    almonds, suddenly bore for two years in succession spherical fleshy
    peach-like fruits, but in 1865 reverted to its former state and
    produced large almonds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Again, as I hear from Mr. Rivers, the
    double-flowering Chinese peaches resemble almonds in their manner
    of growth and in their flowers; the fruit is much elongated and
    flattened, with the flesh both bitter and sweet, but not uneatable,
    and it is said to be of better quality in China. From this stage
    one small step leads us to such inferior peaches as are
    occasionally raised from seed. For instance, Mr. Rivers sowed a
    number of peach-stones imported from the United States, where they
    are collected for raising stocks, and some of the trees raised by
    him produced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance,
    being small and hard, with the pulp not softening till very late in
    the autumn. Van Mons<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> also states
    that he once raised from a peach-stone a peach having the aspect of
    a wild tree, with fruit like that of the almond. From inferior
    peaches, such as these just described, we may pass by small
    transitions, through clingstones of poor quality, to our best and
    most melting kinds. From this gradation, from the cases of sudden
    variation above recorded, and from the fact that the peach has not
    been found wild, it seems to me by far the most probable view, that
    the peach is the descendant of the almond, improved and modified in
    a marvellous manner.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>One fact, however, is opposed to this
    conclusion. A hybrid, raised by Knight from the sweet almond by the
    pollen of the peach, produced flowers with little or no pollen, yet
    bore fruit, having been apparently fertilised by a neighbouring
    nectarine. Another hybrid, from a sweet almond by the pollen of a
    nectarine, produced during the first three years imperfect
    blossoms, but afterwards perfect flowers with an abundance of
    pollen. If this slight degree of sterility cannot be accounted for
    by the youth of the trees (and this often causes lessened
    fertility), or by the monstrous state of the flowers, or by the
    conditions to which the trees were exposed, these two cases would
    afford a good argument against the peach being the descendant of
    the almond.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Whether or not the peach has proceeded
    from the almond, it has certainly given rise to nectarines, or
    smooth peaches, as they are called by the French. Most of the
    varieties, both of the peach and nectarine, reproduce themselves
    truly by seed. Gallesio<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> says he
    has verified this with respect to eight races of the peach. Mr.
    Rivers<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> has given some striking
    instances from his own experience, and it is notorious that good
    peaches are constantly raised in North America from seed. Many of
    the American sub-varieties come true or nearly true to their kind,
    such as the white-blossom, several of the yellow-fruited freestone
    peaches, the blood clingstone, the heath, and the lemon clingstone.
    On the other hand, a clingstone peach has been known to give rise
    to a freestone.<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> In England it has
    been noticed that seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of
    the same size and colour. Some characters, however, contrary to
    what might have been expected, often are not inherited; such as the
    presence and form of the glands on the leaves.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> With respect to nectarines, both cling
    and freestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves
    by seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> In England the new white
    nectarine was a seedling of the old white, and Mr. Rivers<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> has recorded several similar cases. From
    this strong tendency to inheritance, which both peach and nectarine
    trees exhibit,&#8212;from certain slight constitutional
    differences<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> in their
    nature,&#8212;and from the great difference in their fruit both in
    appearance and flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that
    the trees differ in no other respects and cannot even be
    distinguished, as I am informed by Mr. Rivers, whilst young, that
    they have been ranked by some authors as specifically distinct.
    Gallesio does not doubt that they are distinct; even Alph. De
    Candolle does not appear perfectly assured of their specific
    identity: and an eminent botanist has quite recently<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> maintained that the nectarine "probably
    constitutes a distinct species."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Hence it may be worth while to give all
    the evidence on the origin of the nectarine. The facts in
    themselves are curious, and will hereafter have to be referred to
    when the important subject of bud-variation is discussed. It is
    asserted<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> that the Boston
    nectarine was produced from a peach-stone, and this nectarine
    reproduced itself by seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> Mr.
    Rivers states<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> that from stones of
    three distinct varieties of the peach he raised three varieties of
    nectarine; and in one of these cases no nectarine grew near the
    parent peach-tree. In another instance Mr. Rivers raised a
    nectarine from a peach, and in the succeeding generation another
    nectarine from this nectarine.<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
    Other such instances have been communicated to me, but they need
    not be given. Of the converse case, namely, of nectarine-stones
    yielding peach-trees (both free and clingstones), we have six
    undoubted instances recorded by Mr. Rivers; and in two of these
    instances the parent nectarines had been seedlings from other
    nectarines.<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the more curious case of
    full-grown peach-trees suddenly producing nectarines by
    bud-variation (or sports as they are called by gardeners), the
    evidence is superabundant; there is also good evidence of the same
    tree producing both peaches and nectarines, or half-and-half fruit;
    by this term I mean a fruit with the one-half a perfect peach, and
    the other half a perfect nectarine.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Peter Collinson in 1741 recorded the
    first case of a peach-tree producing a nectarine,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> and in 1766 he added two other
    instances. In the same work, the editor, Sir J. E. Smith, describes
    the more remarkable case of a tree in Norfolk which usually bore
    both perfect nectarines and perfect peaches; but during two seasons
    some of the fruit were half and half in nature.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Salisbury in 1808<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> records six other cases of peach-trees
    producing nectarines. Three of the varieties are named; viz., the
    Alberge, Belle Chevreuse, and Royal George. This latter tree seldom
    failed to produce both kinds of fruit. He gives another case of a
    half-and-half fruit.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>At Radford in Devonshire<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> a clingstone peach, purchased as the
    Chancellor, was planted in 1815, and in 1824, after having
    previously produced peaches alone, bore on one branch twelve
    nectarines; in 1825 the same branch yielded twenty-six nectarines,
    and in 1826 thirty-six nectarines, together with eighteen peaches.
    One of the peaches was almost as smooth on one side as a nectarine.
    The nectarines were as dark as, but smaller than, the
    Elruge.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>At Beccles a Royal George peach<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> produced a fruit, "three parts of it
    being peach and one part nectarine, quite distinct in appearance as
    well as in flavour." The lines of division were longitudinal, as
    represented in the woodcut. A nectarine-tree grew five yards from
    this tree.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Professor Chapman states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> that he has often seen in Virginia very
    old peach-trees bearing nectarines.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>A writer in the 'Gardener's Chronicle'
    says that a peach tree planted fifteen years previously<A href=

    two peaches; a nectarine-tree grew close by.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In 1844<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
    a Vanguard peach-tree produced, in the midst of its ordinary fruit,
    a single red Roman nectarine.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Calver is stated<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> to have raised in the United States a
    seedling peach which produced a mixed crop of both peaches and
    nectarines.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Near Dorking<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> a branch of the T&#233;ton de V&#233;nus
    peach, which reproduces itself truly by seed,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> bore its own fruit "so remarkable for
    its prominent point, and a nectarine rather smaller but well formed
    and quite round."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The previous cases all refer to peaches
    suddenly producing nectarines, but at Carclew<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> the unique case occurred, of a
    nectarine-tree, raised twenty years before from seed and never
    grafted, producing a fruit half peach and half nectarine;
    subsequently bore a perfect peach.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>To sum up the foregoing facts; we have
    excellent evidence of peach-stones producing nectarine-trees, and
    of nectarine-stones producing peach-Trees,&#8212;of the same tree
    bearing peaches and nectarines,&#8212;of peach-trees suddenly
    producing by bud-variation nectarines (such nectarines reproducing
    nectarines by seed), as well as fruit in part nectarine and in part
    peach,&#8212;and, lastly, of one nectarine-tree first bearing
    half-and-half fruit, and subsequently true peaches. As the peach
    came into existence before the nectarine, it might have been
    expected from the law of reversion that nectarines would have given
    birth by bud-variation or by seed to peaches, oftener than peaches
    to nectarines; but this is by no means the case.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Two explanations have been suggested to
    account for these conversions. First, that the parent trees have
    been in every case hybrids<A href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
    between the peach and nectarine, and have reverted by bud-variation
    or by seed to one of their pure parent forms. This view in itself
    is not very improbable; for the Mountaineer peach, which was raised
    by Knight from the red nutmeg-peach by pollen of the violette
    h&#226;tive nectarine,<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> produces
    peaches, but these are said <I>sometimes</I> to partake of the
    smoothness and flavour of the nectarine. But let it be observed
    that in the previous list no less than six well-known varieties and
    several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly produced
    perfect nectarines by bud variation: and it would be an extremely
    rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach, which have
    been cultivated for years in many districts, and which show not a
    vestige of a mixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A second
    explanation is, that the fruit of the peach has been directly
    affected by the pollen of the nectarine: although this certainly is
    possible, it cannot here apply; for we have not a shadow of
    evidence that a branch which has borne fruit directly affected by
    foreign pollen is so profoundly modified as afterwards to produce
    buds which continue to yield fruit of the new and modified form.
    Now it is known that when a bud on a peach-tree has once borne a
    nectarine the same branch has in several instances gone on during
    successive years producing nectarines. The Carclew nectarine, on
    the other hand, first produced half-and-half fruit, and
    subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may confidently accept the
    common view that the nectarine is a variety of the peach, which may
    be produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the following
    chapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will he
    given.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The varieties of the peach and the
    nectarine run in parallel lines. In both classes the kinds differ
    from each other in the flesh of the fruit being white, red, or
    yellow; in being clingstones or freestones; in the flowers being
    large or small, with certain other characteristic differences; and
    in the leaves being serrated without glands, or crenated and
    furnished with globose or reniform glands.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> We can hardly account for this
    parallelism by supposing that each variety of the nectarine is
    descended from a corresponding variety of the peach; for though our
    nectarines are certainly the descendants of several kinds of
    peaches, yet a large number are the descendants of other
    nectarines, and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can
    scarcely admit the above explanation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The varieties of the peach have largely
    increased in number since the Christian era, when from two to five
    varieties were known;<A href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> and the
    nectarine was unknown. At the present time, besides many varieties
    said to exist in China, Downing describes, in the United States,
    seventy-nine native and imported varieties of the peach; and a few
    years ago Lindley<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> enumerated one
    hundred and sixty-four varieties of the peach and nectarine grown
    in England. I have already indicated the chief points of difference
    between the several varieties. Nectarines, even when produced from
    distinct kinds of peaches, always possess their own peculiar
    flavour, and are smooth and small. Clingstone and freestone
    peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to
    the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ in the
    character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters
    being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother
    than in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not
    only in size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently
    shaped, more imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale
    towards the margin: whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of
    the petal is usually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly
    white flowers. The leaves are more or less serrated, and are either
    destitute of glands, or have globose or reniform glands;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> and some few peaches, such as the
    Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped
    glands.<A href="#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> According to Robertson<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> the trees with glandular leaves are
    liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew; whilst
    the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, to mildew, and to
    the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their
    maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,&#8212;the
    latter circumstance being especially attended to in the United
    States. Certain varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in
    hot-houses better than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is
    the most remarkable of all the varieties; it is so much depressed
    towards the summit, that the stone is here covered only by
    roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> Another Chinese variety, called the
    Honey-peach, is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long
    sharp point; its leaves are glandless and widely dentate.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> The Emperor of Russia peach is a third
    singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the fruit
    is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the
    other: it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar
    leaves.<A href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The peach has also produced in China a
    small class of trees valued for ornament, namely the
    double-flowered; of these, five varieties are now known in England,
    varying from pure white, through rose, to intense crimson.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> One of these varieties, called the
    camellia-flowered, bears flowers above 2&#188; inches in diameter,
    whilst those of the fruit-bearing kinds do not at most exceed
    1&#188; inch in diameter. The flowers of the double-flowered
    peaches have the singular property<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> of frequently producing double or treble
    fruit. Finally, there is good reason to believe that the peach is
    an almond profoundly modified; but whatever its origin may have
    been, there can be no doubt that it has yielded during the last
    eighteen centuries many varieties, some of them strongly
    characterised, belonging both to the nectarine and peach
    form.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Apricot (Prunus
    armeniaca).</I>&#8212;It is commonly admitted that this tree is
    descended from a single species, now found wild in the Caucasian
    region.<A href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> On this view the
    varieties deserve notice, because they illustrate differences
    supposed by some botanists to be of specific value in the almond
    and plum. The best monograph on the apricot is by Mr. Thompson,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> who describes seventeen varieties.
    We have seen that peaches and nectarines vary in a strictly
    parallel manner; and in the apricot, which forms a closely allied
    genus, we again meet with variations analogous to those of the
    peach, as well as to those of the plum. The varieties differ
    considerably in the shape of their leaves, which are either
    serrated or crenated, sometimes with ear-like appendages at their
    bases, and sometimes with glands on the petioles. The flowers are
    generally alike, but are small in the Masculine. The fruit varies
    much in size, shape, and in having the suture little pronounced or
    absent; in the skin being smooth, or downy, as in the
    orange-apricot; and in the flesh clinging to the stone, as in the
    last-mentioned kind, or in readily separating from it, as in the
    Turkey-apricot. In all these differences we see the closest analogy
    with the varieties of the peach and nectarine. In the stone we have
    more important differences, and these in the case of the plum have
    been esteemed of specific value: in some apricots the stone is
    almost spherical, in others much flattened, being either sharp in
    front or blunt at both ends, sometimes channelled along the back,
    or with a sharp ridge along both margins. In the Moorpark, and
    generally in the Hemskirke, the stone presents a singular character
    in being perforated, with a bundle of fibres passing through the
    perforation from end to end. The most constant and important
    character, according to Thompson, is whether the kernel is bitter
    or sweet: yet in this respect we have a graduated difference, for
    the kernel is very bitter in Shipley's apricot; in the Hemskirke
    less bitter than in some other kinds; slightly bitter in the Royal;
    and "sweet like a hazel-nut" in the Breda, Angoumois, and others.
    In the case of the almond, bitterness has been thought by some high
    authorities to indicate specific difference.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In N. America the Roman apricot endures
    "cold and unfavourable situations, where no other sort, except the
    Masculine, will succeed; and its blossoms bear quite a severe frost
    without injury."<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> According to Mr.
    Rivers,<A href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> seedling apricots deviate
    but little from the character of their race: in France the Alberge
    is constantly reproduced from seed with but little variation. In
    Ladakh, according to Moorcroft,<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A>
    ten varieties of the apricot, very different from each other, are
    cultivated, and all are raised from seed, excepting one, which is
    budded.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Plums (Prunus
    insititia).</I>&#8212;Formerly the sloe, <I>P. spinosa,</I> was
    thought to be the parent of all our plums; but now this honour is
    very commonly accorded to <I>P. insititia</I> or the bullace, which
    is found wild in the Caucasus and N.-Western India, and is
    naturalised in England.<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> It is not
    at all improbable, in accordance with some observations made by Mr.
    Rivers,<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> that both these forms,
    which some botanists rank as a single species, may be the parents
    of our domesticated plums. Another supposed parent-form, the <I>P.
    domestica,</I> is said to be found wild in the region of the
    Caucasus. Godron remarks<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> that the
    cultivated varieties may be divided into two main groups, which he
    supposes to be descended from two aboriginal stocks; namely, those
    with oblong fruit and stones pointed at both ends, having narrow
    separate petals and upright branches; and those with rounded fruit,
    with stones blunt at both ends, with rounded petals and spreading
    branches. From what we know of the variability of the flowers in
    the peach and of the diversified manner of growth in our various
    fruit-trees, it is difficult to lay much weight on these latter
    characters. With respect to the shape of the fruit, we have
    conclusive evidence that it is extremely variable: Downing<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> gives outlines of the plums of two
    seedlings, namely, the red and imperial gages, raised from the
    greengage; and the fruit of both is more elongated than that of the
    greengage. The latter has a very blunt broad stone, whereas the
    stone of the imperial gage is "oval and pointed at both ends."
    These trees also differ in their manner of growth: "the greengage
    is a very short-jointed, slow-growing tree, of spreading and rather
    dwarfish habit;" whilst its offspring, the imperial gage, "grows
    freely and rises rapidly, and has long dark shoots." The famous
    Washington plum bears a globular fruit, but its offspring, the
    emerald drop, is nearly as much elongated as the most elongated
    plum figured by Downing, namely, Manning's prune. I have made a
    small collection of the stones of twenty-five kinds, and they
    graduate in shape from the bluntest into the sharpest kinds. As
    characters derived from seeds are generally of high systematic
    importance, I have thought it worth while to give drawings of the
    most distinct kinds in my small collection; and they may be seen to
    differ in a surprising manner in size, outline, thickness,
    prominence of the ridges, and state of surface. It deserves notice
    that the shape of the stone is not always strictly correlated with
    that of the fruit: thus the Washington plum is spherical and
    depressed at the pole, with a somewhat elongated stone, whilst the
    fruit of the Goliath is more elongated, but the stone less so, than
    in the Washington. Again, Denyer's Victoria and Goliath bear fruit
    closely resembling each other, but their stones are widely
    different. On the other hand, the Harvest and Black Margate plums
    are very dissimilar, yet include closely similar
    stones.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The varieties of the plum are numerous,
    and differ greatly in size, shape, quality, and colour,&#8212;being
    bright yellow, green, almost white, blue, purple, or red. There are
    some curious varieties, such as the double or Siamese, and the
    Stoneless plum: in the latter the kernel lies in a roomy cavity
    surrounded only by the pulp. The climate of North America appears
    to be singularly favourable for the production of new and good
    varieties; Downing describes no less than forty, of which seven of
    first-rate quality have been recently introduced into England.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> Varieties occasionally arise having
    an innate adaptation for certain soils, almost as strongly
    pronounced as with natural species growing on the most distinct
    geological formations; thus in America the imperial gage,
    differently from almost all other kinds, "is peculiarly fitted for
    <I>dry light</I> soils where many sorts drop their fruit," whereas
    on rich heavy soils the fruit is often insipid.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> My father could never succeed in making
    the Wine-Sour yield even a moderate crop in a sandy orchard near
    Shrewsbury, whilst in some parts of the same county and in its
    native Yorkshire it bears abundantly: one of my relations also
    repeatedly tried in vain to grow this variety in a sandy district
    in Staffordshire.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Rivers has given<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> a number of interesting facts, showing
    how truly many varieties can be propagated by seed. He sowed the
    stones of twenty bushels of the greengage for the sake of raising
    stocks, and closely observed the seedlings; all had the smooth
    shoots, the prominent buds, and the glossy leaves of the greengage,
    but the greater number had smaller leaves and thorns." There are
    two kinds of damson, one the Shropshire with downy shoots, and the
    other the Kentish with smooth shoots, and these differ but slightly
    in any other respect: Mr. Rivers sowed some bushels of the Kentish
    damson, and all the seedlings had smooth shoots, but in some the
    fruit was oval, in others round or roundish, and in a few the fruit
    was small, and, except in being sweet, closely resembled that of
    the wild sloe. Mr. Rivers gives several other striking instances of
    inheritance: thus, he raised eighty thousand seedlings from the
    common German Quetsche plum, and "not one could be found varying in
    the least, in foliage or habit." Similar facts were observed with
    the Petite Mirabelle plum, yet this latter kind (as well as the
    Quetsche) is known to have yielded some well-established varieties;
    but, as Mr. Rivers remarks, they all belong to the same group with
    the Mirabelle.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Cherries (Prunus cerasus, avium,
    etc.).</I>&#8212;Botanists believe that our cultivated cherries are
    descended from one, two, four, or even more wild stocks.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A> That there must be at least two parent
    species we may infer from the sterility of twenty hybrids raised by
    Mr. Knight from the morello fertilised by pollen of the Elton
    cherry; for these hybrids produced in all only five cherries, and
    one alone of these contained a seed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> Mr. Thompson<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> has classified the varieties in an
    apparently natural method in two main groups by characters taken
    from the flowers, fruit, and leaves; but some varieties which stand
    widely separate in this classification are quite fertile when
    crossed; thus Knight's Early Black cherries are the product of a
    cross between two such kinds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Knight states that seedling cherries
    are more variable than those of any other fruit-tree.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> In the Catalogue of the Horticultural
    Society for 1842 eighty varieties are enumerated. Some varieties
    present singular characters: thus, the flower of the Cluster cherry
    includes as many as twelve pistils, of which the majority abort;
    and they are said generally to produce from two to five or six
    cherries aggregated together and borne on a single peduncle. In the
    Ratafia cherry several flower-peduncles arise from a common
    peduncle, upwards of an inch in length. The fruit of Gascoigne's
    Heart has its apex produced into a globule or drop; that of the
    white Hungarian Gean has almost transparent flesh. The Flemish
    cherry is "a very odd-looking fruit," much flattened at the summit
    and base, with the latter deeply furrowed, and borne on a stout,
    very short footstalk. In the Kentish cherry the stone adheres so
    firmly to the footstalk, that it could be drawn out of the flesh;
    and this renders the fruit well fitted for drying. The
    Tobacco-leaved cherry, according to Sageret and Thompson, produces
    gigantic leaves, more than a foot and sometimes even eighteen
    inches in length, and half a foot in breadth. The weeping cherry,
    on the other hand, is valuable only as an ornament, and, according
    to Downing, is "a charming little tree, with slender, weeping
    branches, clothed with small, almost myrtle-like foliage." There is
    also a peach-leaved variety.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Sageret describes a remarkable variety,
    <I>le griottier de la Toussaint,</I> which bears at the same time,
    even as late as September, flowers and fruit of all degrees of
    maturity. The fruit, which is of inferior quality, is borne on
    long, very thin footstalks. But the extraordinary statement is made
    that all the leaf-bearing shoots spring from old flower-buds.
    Lastly, there is an important physiological distinction between
    those kinds of cherries which bear fruit on young or on old wood;
    but Sageret positively asserts that a Bigarreau in his garden bore
    fruit on wood of both ages.<A href=

    closely allied wild forms, namely, <I>P. acerba</I> and <I>
    pr&#230;cox</I> or <I>paradisiaca,</I> do not deserve to be ranked
    as distinct species. The <I>P. pr&#230;cox</I> is supposed by some
    authors<A href="#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> to be the parent of the
    dwarf paradise stock, which, owing to the fibrous roots not
    penetrating deeply into the ground, is so largely used for
    grafting; but the paradise stocks, it is asserted,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> cannot be propagated true by seed. The
    common wild crab varies considerably in England; but many of the
    varieties are believed to be escaped seedlings.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> Every one knows the great difference in
    the manner of growth, in the foliage, flowers, and especially in
    the fruit, between the almost innumerable varieties of the apple.
    The pips or seeds (as I know by comparison) likewise differ
    considerably in shape, size, and colour. The fruit is adapted for
    eating or for cooking in various ways, and keeps for only a few
    weeks or for nearly two years. Some few kinds have the fruit
    covered with a powdery secretion, called bloom, like that on plums;
    and "it is extremely remarkable that this occurs almost exclusively
    among varieties cultivated in Russia."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> Another Russian apple, the white
    Astracan, possesses the singular property of becoming transparent,
    when ripe, like some sorts of crabs. The <I>api
    &#233;toil&#233;</I> has five prominent ridges, hence its name; the
    <I>api noir</I> is nearly black: the <I>twin cluster pippin</I>
    often bears fruit joined in pairs.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A> The trees of the several sorts differ
    greatly in their periods of leafing and flowering; in my orchard
    the <I>Court Pendu Plat</I> produces leaves so late, that during
    several springs I thought that it was dead. The Tiffin apple
    scarcely bears a leaf when in full bloom; the Cornish crab, on the
    other hand, bears so many leaves at this period that the flowers
    can hardly be seen.<A href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A> In some kinds
    the fruit ripens in mid-summer; in others, late in the autumn.
    These several differences in leafing, flowering, and fruiting, are
    not at all necessarily correlated; for, as Andrew Knight has
    remarked,<A href="#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> no one can judge from
    the early flowering of a new seedling, or from the early shedding
    or change of colour of the leaves, whether it will mature its fruit
    early in the season.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The varieties differ greatly in
    constitution. It is notorious that our summers are not hot enough
    for the Newtown Pippin,<A href="#refer"><SUP>90</SUP></A> which is
    the glory of the orchards near New York; and so it is with several
    varieties which we have imported from the Continent. On the other
    hand, our Court of Wick succeeds well under the severe climate of
    Canada. The <I>Caville rouge de Micoud</I> occasionally bears two
    crops during the same year. The Burr Knot is covered with small
    excrescences, which emit roots so readily that a branch with
    blossom-buds may be stuck in the ground, and will root and bear a
    few fruit even during the first year.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> Mr. Rivers has recently described<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> some seedlings valuable from their
    roots running near the surface. One of these seedlings was
    remarkable from its extremely dwarfed size, "forming itself into a
    bush only a few inches in height." Many varieties are particularly
    liable to canker in certain soils. But perhaps the strangest
    constitutional peculiarity is that the Winter Majetin is not
    attacked by the mealy bug or coccus; Lindley<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A> states that in an orchard in Norfolk
    infested with these insects the Majetin was quite free, though the
    stock on which it was grafted was affected: Knight makes a similar
    statement with respect to a cider apple, and adds that he only once
    saw these insects just above the stock, but that three days
    afterwards they entirely disappeared; this apple, however, was
    raised from a cross between the Golden Harvey and the Siberian
    Crab; and the latter, I believe, is considered by some authors as
    specifically distinct.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The famous St. Valery apple must not be
    passed over; the flower has a double calyx with ten divisions, and
    fourteen styles surmounted by conspicuous oblique stigmas, but is
    destitute of stamens or corolla. The fruit is constricted round the
    middle, and is formed of five seed-cells, surmounted by nine other
    cells.<A href="#refer"><SUP>94</SUP></A> Not being provided with
    stamens, the tree requires artificial fertilisation; and the girls
    of St. Valery annually go to <I>"faire ses pommes,"</I> each
    marking her own fruit with a ribbon; and as different pollen is
    used the fruit differs, and we here have an instance of the direct
    action of foreign pollen on the mother plant. These monstrous
    apples include, as we have seen, fourteen seed-cells; the
    pigeon-apple,<A href="#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> on the other hand,
    has only four, instead of, as with all common apples, five cells;
    and this certainly is a remarkable difference.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the catalogue of apples published in
    1842 by the Horticultural Society, 897 varieties are enumerated;
    but the differences between most of them are of comparatively
    little interest, as they are not strictly inherited. No one can
    raise, for instance, from the seed of the Ribston Pippin, a tree of
    the same kind; and it is said that the "Sister Ribston Pippin" was
    a white semi-transparent, sour-fleshed apple, or rather large
    crab.<A href="#refer"><SUP>96</SUP></A> Yet it was a mistake to
    suppose that with most varieties the characters are not to a
    certain extent inherited. In two lots of seedlings raised from two
    well-marked kinds, many worthless crab-like seedlings will appear,
    but it is now known that the two lots not only usually differ from
    each other, but resemble to a certain extent their parents. We see
    this indeed in the several sub-groups of Russetts, Sweetings,
    Codlins, Pearmains, Reinettes, etc.,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>97</SUP></A> which are all believed, and many are
    known, to be descended from other varieties bearing the same
    names.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Pears (Pyrus communis).</I>&#8212;I
    need say little on this fruit, which varies much in the wild state,
    and to an extraordinary degree when cultivated, in its fruit,
    flowers, and foliage. One of the most celebrated botanists in
    Europe, M. Decaisne, has carefully studied the many varieties;<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>98</SUP></A> although he formerly believed that
    they were derived from more than one species, he now thinks that
    all belong to one. He has arrived at this conclusion from finding
    in the several varieties a perfect gradation between the most
    extreme characters; so perfect is this gradation that he maintains
    it to be impossible to classify the varieties by any natural
    method. M. Decaisne raised many seedlings from four distinct kinds,
    and has carefully recorded the variations in each. Notwithstanding
    this extreme degree of variability, it is now positively known that
    many kinds reproduce by seed the leading characters of their
    race.<A href="#refer"><SUP>99</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Strawberries
    (Fragaria).</I>&#8212;This fruit is remarkable on account of the
    number of species which have been cultivated, and from their rapid
    improvement within the last fifty or sixty years. Let any one
    compare the fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our
    Shows with that of the wild wood strawberry, or, which will be a
    fairer comparison, with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild
    American Virginian Strawberry, and he will see what prodigies
    horticulture has effected.<A href="#refer"><SUP>100</SUP></A> The
    number of varieties has likewise increased in a surprisingly rapid
    manner. Only three kinds were known in France, in 1746, where this
    fruit was early cultivated. In 1766 five species had been
    introduced, the same which are now cultivated, but only five
    varieties of <I>Fragaria vesca,</I> with some sub-varieties, had
    been produced. At the present day the varieties of the several
    species are almost innumerable. The species consist of, firstly,
    the wood or Alpine cultivated strawberries, descended from <I>F.
    vesca,</I> a native of Europe and of North America. There are eight
    wild European varieties, as ranked by Duchesne, of <I>F. vesca,</I>
    but several of these are considered species by some botanists.
    Secondly, the green strawberries, descended from the European <I>F.
    collina,</I> and little cultivated in England. Thirdly, the
    Hautbois, from the European <I>F. elatior.</I> Fourthly, the
    Scarlets, descended from <I>F. virginiana,</I> a native of the
    whole breadth of North America. Fifthly, the Chili, descended from
    <I>F. chiloensis,</I> an inhabitant of the west coast of the
    temperate parts both of North and South America. Lastly, the pines
    or Carolinas (including the old Blacks), which have been ranked by
    most authors under the name of <I>F. grandiflora</I> as a distinct
    species, said to inhabit Surinam; but this is a manifest error.
    This form is considered by the highest authority, M. Gay, to be
    merely a strongly marked race of <I>F. chiloensis.</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>101</SUP></A> These five or six forms have been
    ranked by most botanists as specifically distinct; but this may be
    doubted, for Andrew Knight,<A href="#refer"><SUP>102</SUP></A> who
    raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries, asserts that the <I>
    F. virginiana, chiloensis</I> and <I>grandiflora</I> "may be made
    to breed together indiscriminately," and he found, in accordance
    with the principle of analogous variation, "that similar varieties
    could be obtained from the seeds of any one of them."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Since Knight's time there is abundant and
    additional evidence<A href="#refer"><SUP>103</SUP></A> of the
    extent to which the American forms spontaneously cross. We owe
    indeed to such crosses most of our choicest existing varieties.
    Knight did not succeed in crossing the European wood-strawberry
    with the American Scarlet or with the Hautbois. Mr. Williams of
    Pitmaston, however, succeeded; but the hybrid offspring from the
    Hautbois, though fruiting well, never produced seed, with the
    exception of a single one, which reproduced the parent hybrid
    form.<A href="#refer"><SUP>104</SUP></A> Major R. Trevor Clarke
    informs me that he crossed two members of the Pine class (Myatt's
    B. Queen and Keen's Seedling) with the wood and hautbois, and that
    in each case he raised only a single seedling; one of these
    fruited, but was almost barren. Mr. W. Smith, of York, has raised
    similar hybrids with equally poor success.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>105</SUP></A> We thus see<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>106</SUP></A> that the European and American species
    can with some difficulty be crossed; but it is improbable that
    hybrids sufficiently fertile to be worth cultivation will ever be
    thus produced. This fact is surprising, as these forms structurally
    are not widely distinct, and are sometimes connected in the
    districts where they grow wild, as I hear from Professor Asa Gray,
    by puzzling intermediate forms.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The energetic culture of the Strawberry
    is of recent date, and the cultivated varieties can in most cases
    be classed under some one of the above native stocks. As the
    American strawberries cross so freely and spontaneously, we can
    hardly doubt that they will ultimately become inextricably
    confused. We find, indeed, that horticulturists at present disagree
    under which class to rank some few of the varieties; and a writer
    in the 'Bon Jardinier' of 1840 remarks that formerly it was
    possible to class all of them under some one species, but that now
    this is quite impossible with the American forms, the new English
    varieties having completely filled up the gaps between them.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>107</SUP></A> The blending together of two or
    more aboriginal forms, which there is every reason to believe has
    occurred with some of our anciently cultivated productions, we see
    now actually occurring with our strawberries.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The cultivated species offer some
    variations worth notice. The Black Prince, a seedling from Keen's
    Imperial (this latter being a seedling of a very white strawberry,
    the white Carolina), is remarkable from "its peculiar dark and
    polished surface, and from presenting an appearance entirely unlike
    that of any other kind."<A href="#refer"><SUP>108</SUP></A>
    Although the fruit in the different varieties differs so greatly in
    form, size, colour, and quality, the so-called seed (which
    corresponds with the whole fruit in the plum) with the exception of
    being more or less deeply embedded in the pulp, is, according to De
    Jonghe,<A href="#refer"><SUP>109</SUP></A> absolutely the same in
    all: and this no doubt may be accounted for by the seed being of no
    value, and consequently not having been subjected to selection. The
    strawberry is properly three-leaved, but in 1761 Duchesne raised a
    single-leaved variety of the European wood-strawberry, which
    Linn&#230;us doubtfully raised to the rank of a species. Seedlings
    of this variety, like those of most varieties not fixed by
    long-continued selection, often revert to the ordinary form, or
    present intermediate states.<A href="#refer"><SUP>110</SUP></A> A
    variety raised by Mr. Myatt,<A href="#refer"><SUP>111</SUP></A>
    apparently belonging to one of the American forms presents a
    variation of an opposite nature, for it has five leaves; Godron and
    Lambertye also mention a five-leaved variety of <I>F.
    collina.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The Red Bush Alpine strawberry (one of
    the <I>F. vesca</I> section) does not produce stolons or runners,
    and this remarkable deviation of structure is reproduced truly by
    seed. Another sub-variety, the White Bush Alpine, is similarly
    characterised, but when propagated by seed it often degenerates and
    produces plants with runners.<A href="#refer"><SUP>112</SUP></A> A
    strawberry of the American Pine section is also said to make but
    few runners.<A href="#refer"><SUP>113</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Much has been written on the sexes of
    strawberries; the true Hautbois properly bears the male and female
    organs on separate plants,<A href="#refer"><SUP>114</SUP></A> and
    was consequently named by Duchesne <I>dioica</I>; but it frequently
    produces hermaphrodites; and Lindley,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>115</SUP></A> by propagating such plants by runners,
    at the same time destroying the males, soon raised a self-prolific
    stock. The other species often showed a tendency towards an
    imperfect separation of the sexes, as I have noticed with plants
    forced in a hot-house. Several English varieties, which in this
    country are free from any such tendency, when cultivated in rich
    soils under the climate of North America<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>116</SUP></A> commonly produce plants with separate
    sexes. Thus a whole acre of Keen's Seedlings in the United States
    has been observed to be almost sterile from the absence of male
    flowers; but the more general rule is, that the male plants overrun
    the females. Some members of the Cincinnati Horticultural Society,
    especially appointed to investigate this subject, report that "few
    varieties have the flowers perfect in both sexual organs," etc. The
    most successful cultivators in Ohio plant for every seven rows of
    "pistillata," or female plants, one row of hermaphrodites, which
    afford pollen for both kinds; but the hermaphrodites, owing to
    their expenditure in the production of pollen, bear less fruit than
    the female plants.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The varieties differ in constitution.
    Some of our best English kinds, such as Keen's Seedlings, are too
    tender for certain parts of North America, where other English and
    many American varieties succeed perfectly. That splendid fruit, the
    British Queen, can be cultivated but in few places either in
    England or France: but this apparently depends more on the nature
    of the soil than on the climate; a famous gardener says that "no
    mortal could grow the British Queen at Shrubland Park unless the
    whole nature of the soil was altered."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>117</SUP></A> La Constantine is one of the hardiest
    kinds, and can withstand Russian winters, but it is easily burnt by
    the sun, so that it will not succeed in certain soils either in
    England or the United States.<A href="#refer"><SUP>118</SUP></A>
    The Filbert Pine Strawberry "requires more water than any other
    variety; and if the plants once suffer from drought, they will do
    little or no good afterwards."<A href="#refer"><SUP>119</SUP></A>
    Cuthill's Black Prince Strawberry evinces a singular tendency to
    mildew; no less than six cases have been recorded of this variety
    suffering severely, whilst other varieties growing close by, and
    treated in exactly the same manner, were not at all infested by
    this fungus.<A href="#refer"><SUP>120</SUP></A> The time of
    maturity differs much in the different varieties: some belonging to
    the wood or alpine section produce a succession of crops throughout
    the summer.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Gooseberry (Ribes
    grossularia).</I>&#8212;No one, I believe, has hitherto doubted
    that all the cultivated kinds are sprung from the wild plant
    bearing this name, which is common in Central and Northern Europe;
    therefore it will be desirable briefly to specify all the points,
    though not very important, which have varied. If it be admitted
    that these differences are due to culture, authors perhaps will not
    be so ready to assume the existence of a large number of unknown
    wild parent-stocks for our other cultivated plants. The gooseberry
    is not alluded to by writers of the classical period. Turner
    mentions it in 1573, and Parkinson specifies eight varieties in
    1629; the Catalogue of the Horticultural Society for 1842 gives 149
    varieties, and the lists of the Lancashire nurserymen are said to
    include above 300 names.<A href="#refer"><SUP>121</SUP></A> In the
    'Gooseberry Grower's Register' for 1862 I find that 243 distinct
    varieties have won prizes at various periods, so that a vast number
    must have been exhibited. No doubt the difference between many of
    the varieties is very small; but Mr. Thompson in classifying the
    fruit for the Horticultural Society found less confusion in the
    nomenclature of the gooseberry than of any other fruit, and he
    attributes this "to the great interest which the prize-growers have
    taken in detecting sorts with wrong names," and this shows that all
    the kinds, numerous as they are, can be recognised with
    certainty.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The bushes differ in their manner of
    growth, being erect, or spreading, or pendulous. The periods of
    leafing and flowering differ both absolutely and relatively to each
    other; thus the Whitesmith produces early flowers, which from not
    being protected by the foliage, as it is believed, continually fail
    to produce fruit.<A href="#refer"><SUP>122</SUP></A> The leaves
    vary in size, tint, and in depth of lobes; they are smooth, downy,
    or hairy on the upper surface. The branches are more or less downy
    or spinose; "the Hedgehog has probably derived its name from the
    singular bristly condition of its shoots and fruit." The branches
    of the wild gooseberry, I may remark, are smooth, with the
    exception of thorns at the bases of the buds. The thorns themselves
    are either very small, few and single, or very large and triple;
    they are sometimes reflexed and much dilated at their bases. In the
    different varieties the fruit varies in abundance, in the period of
    maturity, in hanging until shrivelled, and greatly in size, "some
    sorts having their fruit large during a very early period of
    growth, whilst others are small, until nearly ripe." The fruit
    varies also much in colour, being red, yellow, green, and
    white&#8212;the pulp of one dark-red gooseberry being tinged with
    yellow; in flavour; in being smooth or downy,&#8212;few, however,
    of the Red gooseberries, whilst many of the so-called Whites, are
    downy; or in being so spinose that one kind is called Henderson's
    Porcupine. Two kinds acquire when mature a powdery bloom on their
    fruit. The fruit varies in the thickness and veining of the skin,
    and, lastly, in shape, being spherical, oblong, oval, or obovate.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>123</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I cultivated fifty-four varieties, and,
    considering how greatly the fruit differs, it was curious how
    closely similar the flowers were in all these kinds. In only a few
    I detected a trace of difference in the size or colour of the
    corolla. The calyx differed in a rather greater degree, for in some
    kinds it was much redder than in others; and in one smooth white
    gooseberry it was unusually red. The calyx also differed in the
    basal part being smooth or woolly, or covered with glandular hairs.
    It deserves notice, as being contrary to what might have been
    expected from the law of correlation, that a smooth red gooseberry
    had a remarkably hairy calyx. The flowers of the Sportsman are
    furnished with very large coloured bracte&#230;; and this is the
    most singular deviation of structure which I have observed. These
    same flowers also varied much in the number of the petals, and
    occasionally in the number of the stamens and pistils; so that they
    were semi-monstrous in structure, yet they produced plenty of
    fruit. Mr. Thompson remarks that in the Pastime gooseberry "extra
    bracts are often attached to the sides of the fruit."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>124</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The most interesting point in the history
    of the gooseberry is the steady increase in the size of the fruit.
    Manchester is the metropolis of the fanciers, and prizes from five
    shillings to five or ten pounds are yearly given for the heaviest
    fruit. The 'Gooseberry Growers Register' is published annually; the
    earliest known copy is dated 1786, but it is certain that meetings
    for the adjudication of prizes were held some years previously.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>125</SUP></A> The 'Register' for 1845 gives an
    account of 171 Gooseberry Shows, held in different places during
    that year; and this fact shows on how large a scale the culture has
    been carried on. The fruit of the wild gooseberry is said<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>126</SUP></A> to weigh about a quarter of an ounce or
    5 dwts., that is, 120 grains; about the year 1786 gooseberries were
    exhibited weighing 10 dwts., so that the weight was then doubled;
    in 1817 26 dwts. 17 grs. was attained; there was no advance till
    1825, when 31 dwts. 16 grs. was reached; in 1830 "Teazer" weighed
    32 dwts. 13 grs.; in 1841 "Wonderful" weighed 32 dwts. 16 grs.; in
    1844 "London" weighed 35 dwts. 12 grs., and in the following year
    36 dwts. 16 grs.; and in 1852 in Staffordshire, the fruit of the
    same variety reached the astonishing weight of 37 dwts. 7 grs.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>127</SUP></A> or 896 grs.; that is, between
    seven or eight times the weight of the wild fruit. I find that a
    small apple, 6&#189; inches in circumference, has exactly this same
    weight. The "London" gooseberry (which in 1852 had altogether
    gained 333 prizes) has, up to the present year of 1875, never
    reached a greater weight than that attained in 1852. Perhaps the
    fruit of the gooseberry has now reached the greatest possible
    weight, unless in the course of time some new and distinct variety
    shall arise.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This gradual, and on the whole steady
    increase of weight from the latter part of the last century to the
    year 1852, is probably in large part due to improved methods of
    cultivation, for extreme care is now taken; the branches and roots
    are trained, composts are made, the soil is mulched, and only a few
    berries are left on each bush;<A href="#refer"><SUP>128</SUP></A>
    but the increase no doubt is in main part due to the continued
    selection of seedlings which have been found to be more and more
    capable of yielding such extraordinary fruit. Assuredly the
    "Highwayman" in 1817 could not have produced fruit like that of the
    "Roaring Lion" in 1825; nor could the "Roaring Lion," though it was
    grown by many persons in many places, gain the supreme triumph
    achieved in 1852 by the "London" Gooseberry.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Walnut (Juglans regia).</I>&#8212;This
    tree and the common nut belong to a widely different order from the
    foregoing fruits, and are therefore here noticed. The walnut grows
    wild on the Caucasus and in the Himalaya, where Dr. Hooker<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>129</SUP></A> found the fruit of full size, but "as
    hard as a hickory-nut." It has been found fossil, as M. de Saporta
    informs me, in the tertiary formation, of France.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In England the walnut presents
    considerable differences, in the shape and size of the fruit, in
    the thickness of the husk, and in the thinness of the shell; this
    latter quality has given rise to a variety called the thin-shelled,
    which is valuable, but suffers from the attacks of tit-mice.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>130</SUP></A> The degree to which the kernel
    fills the shell varies much. In France there is a variety called
    the Grape or cluster-walnut, in which the nuts grow in "bunches of
    ten, fifteen, or even twenty together." There is another variety
    which bears on the same tree differently shaped leaves, like the
    heterophyllous hornbeam; this tree is also remarkable from having
    pendulous branches, and bearing elongated, large, thin-shelled
    nuts.<A href="#refer"><SUP>131</SUP></A> M. Cardan has minutely
    described<A href="#refer"><SUP>132</SUP></A> some singular
    physiological peculiarities in the June-leafing variety, which
    produces its leaves and flowers four or five weeks later than the
    common varieties; and although in August it is apparently in
    exactly the same state of forwardness as the other kinds, it
    retains its leaves and fruit much later in the autumn. These
    constitutional peculiarities are strictly inherited. Lastly,
    walnut-trees, which are properly monoicous, sometimes entirely fail
    to produce male flowers.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>133</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Nuts (Corylus
    avellana).</I>&#8212;Most botanists rank all the varieties under
    the same species, the common wild nut.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>134</SUP></A> The husk, or involucre, differs
    greatly, being extremely short in Barr's Spanish, and extremely
    long in filberts, in which it is contracted so as to prevent the
    nut falling out. This kind of husk also protects the nut from
    birds, for titmice (<I>Parus</I>) have been observed <A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>135</SUP></A> to pass over filberts, and attack cobs
    and common nuts growing in the same orchard. In the purple-filbert
    the husk is purple, and in the frizzled-filbert it is curiously
    laciniated; in the red-filbert the pellicle of the kernel is red.
    The shell is thick in some varieties, but is thin in Cosford's-nut,
    and in one variety is of a bluish colour. The nut itself differs
    much in size and shape, being ovate and compressed in filberts,
    nearly round and of great size in cobs and Spanish nuts, oblong and
    longitudinally striated in Cosford's, and obtusely four-sided in
    the Downton Square nut.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Cucurbitaceous plants.</I>&#8212;These
    plants have been for a long period the opprobrium of botanists;
    numerous varieties have been ranked as species, and, what happens
    more rarely, forms which now must be considered as species have
    been classed as varieties. Owing to the admirable experimental
    researches of a distinguished botanist, M. Naudin,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>136</SUP></A> a flood of light has recently been
    thrown on this group of plants. M. Naudin, during many years,
    observed and experimented on above 1200 living specimens, collected
    from all quarters of the world. Six species are now recognised in
    the genus Cucurbita; but three alone have been cultivated and
    concern us, namely, <I>C. maxima</I> and <I>pepo,</I> which include
    all pumpkins, gourds, squashes, and the vegetable marrow, and <I>C.
    moschata.</I> These three species are not known in a wild state;
    but Asa Gray<A href="#refer"><SUP>137</SUP></A> gives good reason
    for believing that some pumpkins are natives of N.
    America.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>These three species are closely allied,
    and have the same general habit, but their innumerable varieties
    can always be distinguished, according to Naudin, by certain almost
    fixed characters; and what is still more important, when crossed
    they yield no seed, or only sterile seed; whilst the varieties
    spontaneously intercross with the utmost freedom. Naudin insists
    strongly (p. 15), that, though these three species have varied
    greatly in many characters, yet it has been in so closely an
    analogous manner that the varieties can he arranged in almost
    parallel series, as we have seen with the forms of wheat, with the
    two main races of the peach, and in other cases. Though some of the
    varieties are inconstant in character, yet others, when grown
    separately under uniform conditions of life, are, as Naudin
    repeatedly (pp. 6, 16, 35) urges, "dou&#233;es d'une stabilit&#233;
    presque comparable &#224; celle des esp&#232;ces les mieux
    caract&#233;ris&#233;es." One variety, l'Orangin (pp. 43, 63), has
    such prepotency in transmitting its character, that when crossed
    with other varieties a vast majority of the seedlings come true.
    Naudin, referring (p. 47) to <I>C. pepo,</I> says that its races
    "ne different des esp&#232;ces veritables qu'en ce qu'elles peuvent
    s'allier les unes aux autres par voie d'hybridit&#233;, sans que
    leur descendance perde la facult&#233; de se perp&#233;tuer." If we
    were to trust to external differences alone, and give up the test
    of sterility, a multitude of species would have to be formed out of
    the varieties of these three species of Cucurbita. Many naturalists
    at the present day lay far too little stress, in my opinion, on the
    test of sterility; yet it is not improbable that distinct species
    of plants after a long course of cultivation and variation may have
    their mutual sterility eliminated, as we have every reason to
    believe has occurred with domesticated animals. Nor, in the case of
    plants under cultivation, should we be justified in assuming that
    varieties never acquire a slight degree of mutual sterility, as we
    shall more fully see in a future chapter when certain facts are
    given on the high authority of G&#228;rtner and K&#246;lreuter.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>138</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The forms of <I>C. pepo</I> are classed
    by Naudin under seven sections, each including subordinate
    varieties. He considers this plant as probably the most variable in
    the world. The fruit of one variety (pp. 33, 46) exceeds in value
    that of another by more than two thousand fold! When the fruit is
    of very large size, the number produced is few (p. 45); when of
    small size, many are produced. No less astonishing (p. 33) is the
    variation in the shape of the fruit, the typical form apparently is
    egg-like, but this becomes either drawn out into a cylinder, or
    shortened into a flat disc. We have also an almost infinite
    diversity in the colour and state of surface of the fruit, in the
    hardness both of the shell and of the flesh, and in the taste of
    the flesh, which is either extremely sweet, farinaceous, or
    slightly bitter. The seeds also differ in a slight degree in shape,
    and wonderfully in size (p. 34), namely, from six or seven to more
    than twenty-five millim&#232;tres in length.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the varieties which grow upright or do
    not run and climb, the tendrils, though useless (p. 31), are either
    present or are represented by various semi-monstrous organs, or are
    quite absent. The tendrils are even absent in some running
    varieties in which the stems are much elongated. It is a singular
    fact that (p. 31) in all the varieties with dwarfed stems, the
    leaves closely resemble each other in shape.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Those naturalists who believe in the
    immutability of species often maintain that, even in the most
    variable forms, the characters which they consider of specific
    value are unchangeable. To give an example from a conscientious
    writer,<A href="#refer"><SUP>139</SUP></A> who, relying on the
    labours of M. Naudin, and referring to the species of Cucurbita,
    says, "au milieu de toutes les variations du fruit, les tiges, les
    feuilles, les calices, les corolles, les &#233;tamines restent
    invariables dans chacune d'elles." Yet M. Naudin, in describing <I>
    Cucurbita pepo</I> (p. 30), says, "Ici, d'ailleurs, ce ne sont pas
    seulement les fruits qui varient, c'est aussi le feuillage et tout
    le port de la plante. N&#233;anmoins, je crois qu'on la distinguera
    toujours facilement des deux autres esp&#232;ces, si l'on veut ne
    pas perdre de vue les caract&#232;res diff&#233;rentiels que je
    m'efforce de faire ressortir. Ces caract&#232;res sont quelquefois
    peu marqu&#233;s: il arrive meme que plusieurs d'entre eux
    s'effacent presque enti&#232;rement, mais ii en reste toujours
    quelques-uns qui remettent l'observateur sur la voie." Now let it
    be noted what a difference, with regard to the immutability of the
    so-called specific characters this paragraph produces on the mind,
    from that above quoted from M. Godron.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will add another remark: naturalists
    continually assert that no important organ varies; but in saying
    this they unconsciously argue in a vicious circle; for if an organ,
    let it be what it may, is highly variable, it is regarded as
    unimportant, and under a systematic point of view this is quite
    correct. But as long as constancy is thus taken as the criterion of
    importance, it will indeed be long before an important organ can be
    shown to be inconstant. The enlarged form of the stigmas, and their
    sessile position on the summit of the ovary, must be considered as
    important characters, and were used by Gasparini to separate
    certain pumpkins as a <I>distinct genus</I>; but Naudin says (p.
    20), these parts have no constancy, and in the flowers of the
    Turban varieties of <I>C. maxima</I> they sometimes resume their
    ordinary structure. Again, in <I>C. maxima,</I> the carpels (p. 19)
    which form the turban project even as much as two-thirds of their
    length out of the receptacle, and this latter part is thus reduced
    to a sort of platform; but this remarkable structure occurs only in
    certain varieties, and graduates into the common form in which the
    carpels are almost entirely enveloped within the receptacle. In <I>
    C. moschata</I> the ovarium (p. 50) varies greatly in shape, being
    oval, nearly spherical, or cylindrical, more or less swollen in the
    upper part, or constricted round the middle, and either straight or
    curved. When the ovarium is short and oval the interior structure
    does not differ from that of <I>C. maxima</I> and <I>pepo,</I> but
    when it is elongated the carpels occupy only the terminal and
    swollen portion. I may add that in one variety of the cucumber
    (<I>Cucumis sativus</I>) the fruit regularly contains five carpels
    instead of three.<A href="#refer"><SUP>140</SUP></A> I presume that
    it will not be disputed that we here have instances of great
    variability in organs of the highest physiological importance, and
    with most plants of the highest classificatory importance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Sageret<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>141</SUP></A> and Naudin found that the cucumber
    (<I>C. sativus</I>) could not be crossed with any other species of
    the genus; therefore no doubt it is specifically distinct from the
    melon. This will appear to most persons a superfluous statement;
    yet we hear from Naudin<A href="#refer"><SUP>142</SUP></A> that
    there is a race of melons, in which the fruit is so like that of
    the cucumber, "both externally and internally, that it is hardly
    possible to distinguish the one from the other except by the
    leaves." The varieties of the melon seem to be endless, for Naudin
    after six years' study had not come to the end of them: he divides
    them into ten sections, including numerous sub-varieties which all
    intercross with perfect ease.<A href="#refer"><SUP>143</SUP></A> Of
    the forms considered by Naudin to be varieties, botanists have made
    thirty distinct species! "and they had not the slightest
    acquaintance with the multitude of new forms which have appeared
    since their time." Nor is the creation of so many species at all
    surprising when we consider how strictly their characters are
    transmitted by seed, and how wonderfully they differ in appearance:
    "Mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas, sed multo magis
    fructuum," says Naudin. The fruit is the valuable part, and this,
    in accordance with the common rule, is the most modified part. Some
    melons are only as large as small plums, others weigh as much as
    sixty-six pounds. One variety has a scarlet fruit! Another is not
    more than an inch in diameter, but sometimes more than a yard in
    length, "twisting about in all directions like a serpent." It is a
    singular fact that in this latter variety many parts of the plant,
    namely, the stems, the footstalks of the female flowers, the middle
    lobe of the leaves, and especially the ovarium, as well as the
    mature fruit, all show a strong tendency to become elongated.
    Several varieties of the melon are interesting from assuming the
    characteristic features of distinct species and even of distinct
    though allied genera: thus the serpent-melon has some resemblance
    to the fruit of <I>Trichosanthes anguina</I>; we have seen that
    other varieties closely resemble cucumbers; some Egyptian varieties
    have their seeds attached to a portion of the pulp, and this is
    characteristic of certain wild forms. Lastly, a variety of melon
    from Algiers is remarkable from announcing its maturity by "a
    spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation," when deep cracks
    suddenly appear, and the fruit falls to pieces; and this occurs
    with the wild <I>C. momordica.</I> Finally, M. Naudin well remarks
    that this "extraordinary production of races and varieties by a
    single species and their permanence when not interfered with by
    crossing, are phenomena well calculated to cause
    reflection."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Trees deserve a passing notice on account
    of the numerous varieties which they present, differing in their
    precocity, in their manner of growth, their foliage, and bark. Thus
    of the common ash (<I>Fraxinus excelsior</I>) the catalogue of
    Messrs. Lawson of Edinburgh includes twenty-one varieties, some of
    which differ much in their bark; there is a yellow, a streaked
    reddish-white, a purple, a wart-barked and a fungous-barked
    variety.<A href="#refer"><SUP>144</SUP></A> Of hollies no less than
    eighty-four varieties are grown alongside each other in Mr. Paul's
    nursery.<A href="#refer"><SUP>145</SUP></A> In the case of trees,
    all the recorded varieties, as far as I can find out, have been
    suddenly produced by one single act of variation. The length of
    time required to raise many generations, and the little value set
    on the fanciful varieties, explains how it is that successive
    modifications have not been accumulated by selection; hence, also,
    it follows that we do not here meet with sub-varieties subordinate
    to varieties, and these again subordinate to higher groups. On the
    Continent, however, where the forests are more carefully attended
    to than in England, Alph. De Candolle<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>146</SUP></A> says that there is not a forester who
    does not search for seeds from that variety which he esteems the
    most valuable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Our useful trees have seldom been exposed
    to any great change of conditions; they have not been richly
    manured, and the English kinds grow under their proper climate. Yet
    in examining extensive beds of seedlings in nursery-gardens
    considerable differences may be generally observed in them; and
    whilst touring in England I have been surprised at the amount of
    difference in the appearance of the same species in our hedgerows
    and woods. But as plants vary so much in a truly wild state, it
    would be difficult for even a skilful botanist to pronounce
    whether, as I believe to be the case, hedgerow trees vary more than
    those growing in a primeval forest. Trees when planted by man in
    woods or hedges do not grow where they would naturally be able to
    hold their place against a host of competitors, and are therefore
    exposed to conditions not strictly natural: even this slight change
    would probably suffice to cause seedlings raised from such trees to
    be variable. Whether or not our half-wild English trees, as a
    general rule, are more variable than trees growing in their native
    forests, there can hardly be a doubt that they have yielded a
    greater number of strongly-marked and singular variations of
    structure.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In manner of growth, we have weeping or
    pendulous varieties of the willow, ash, elm, oak, and yew, and
    other trees; and this weeping habit is sometimes inherited, though
    in a singularly capricious manner. In the Lombardy poplar, and in
    certain fastigiate or pyramidal varieties of thorns, junipers,
    oaks, etc., we have an opposite kind of growth. The Hessian oak,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>147</SUP></A> which is famous from its
    fastigiate habit and size, bears hardly any resemblance in general
    appearance to a common oak; "its acorns are not sure to produce
    plants of the same habit; some, however, turn out the same as the
    parent-tree." Another fastigiate oak is said to have been found
    wild in the Pyrenees, and this is a surprising circumstance; it
    generally comes so true by seed, that De Candolle considered it as
    specifically distinct.<A href="#refer"><SUP>148</SUP></A> The
    fastigiate Juniper (<I>J. suecica</I>) likewise transmits its
    character by seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>149</SUP></A> Dr. Falconer
    informs me that in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta the great heat
    caused apple-trees to become fastigiate; and we thus see the same
    result following from the effects of climate and from some unknown
    cause.<A href="#refer"><SUP>150</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In foliage we have variegated leaves
    which are often inherited; dark purple or red leaves, as in the
    hazel, barberry, and beech, the colour in these two latter trees
    being sometimes strongly and sometimes weakly inherited;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>151</SUP></A> deeply-cut leaves; and leaves covered
    with prickles, as in the variety of the holly well called <I>
    ferox,</I> which is said to reproduce itself by seed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>152</SUP></A> In fact, nearly all the peculiar
    varieties evince a tendency, more or less strongly marked, to
    reproduce themselves by seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>153</SUP></A>
    This is to a certain extent the case, according to Bosc,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>154</SUP></A> with three varieties of the elm,
    namely, the broad-leafed, lime-leafed, and twisted elm, in which
    latter the fibres of the wood are twisted. Even with the
    heterophyllous hornbeam (<I>Carpinus betulus</I>), which bears on
    each twig leaves of two shapes, "several plants raised from seed
    all retained "the same peculiarity."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>155</SUP></A> I will add only one other remarkable
    case of variation in foliage, namely, the occurrence of two
    sub-varieties of the ash with simple instead of pinnated leaves,
    and which generally transmit their character by seed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>156</SUP></A> The occurrence, in trees belonging to
    widely different orders, of weeping and fastigiate varieties, and
    of trees bearing deeply cut, variegated, and purple leaves, shows
    that these deviations of structure must result from some very
    general physiological laws.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Differences in general appearance and
    foliage, not more strongly marked than those above indicated, have
    led good observers to rank as distinct species certain forms which
    are now known to be mere varieties. Thus, a plane-tree long
    cultivated in England was considered by almost every one as a North
    American species: but is now ascertained by old records, as I am
    informed by Dr. Hooker, to be a variety. So, again, the <I>Thuja
    pendula</I> or <I>filiformis</I> was ranked by such good observers
    as Lambert, Wallich, and others, as a true species; but it is now
    known that the original plants, five in number, suddenly appeared
    in a bed of seedlings, raised at Mr. Loddige's nursery, from <I>T.
    orientalis</I>; and Dr. Hooker has adduced excellent evidence that
    at Turin seeds of <I>T. pendula</I> have reproduced the parent
    form, <I>T. orientalis.</I><A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Every one must have noticed how certain
    individual trees regularly put forth and shed their leaves earlier
    or later than others of the same species. There is a famous
    horse-chestnut in the Tuileries which is named from leafing so much
    earlier than the others. There is also an oak near Edinburgh which
    retains its leaves to a very late period. These differences have
    been attributed by some authors to the nature of the soil in which
    the trees grow; but Archbishop Whately grafted an early thorn on a
    late one, and <I>vice versa,</I> and both grafts kept to their
    proper periods, which differed by about a fortnight, as if they
    still grew on their own stocks.<A href="#refer"><SUP>158</SUP></A>
    There is a Cornish variety of the elm which is almost an evergreen,
    and is so tender that the shoots are often killed by the frost; and
    the varieties of the Turkish oak (<I>Q. cerris</I>) may be arranged
    as deciduous, sub-evergreen, and evergreen.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Scotch Fir (Pinus
    sylvestris).</I>&#8212;I allude to this tree as it bears on the
    question of the greater variability of our hedgerow trees compared
    with those under strictly natural conditions. A well-informed
    writer<A href="#refer"><SUP>160</SUP></A> states that the Scotch
    fir presents few varieties in its native Scotch forests; but that
    it "varies much in figure and foliage, and in the size, shape, and
    colour of its cones, when several generations have been produced
    away from its native locality." There is little doubt that the
    highland and lowland varieties differ in the value of their timber,
    and that they can be propagated truly by seed; thus justifying
    Loudon's remark, that "a variety is often of as much importance as
    a species, and sometimes far more so."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>161</SUP></A> I may mention one rather important
    point in which this tree occasionally varies; in the classification
    of the Conifer&#230;, sections are founded on whether two, three,
    or five leaves are included in the same sheath; the Scotch fir has
    properly only two leaves thus enclosed, but specimens have been
    observed with groups of three leaves in a sheath.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>162</SUP></A> Besides these differences in the
    semi-cultivated Scotch fir, there are in several parts of Europe
    natural or geographical races, which have been ranked by some
    authors as distinct species.<A href="#refer"><SUP>163</SUP></A>
    Loudon<A href="#refer"><SUP>164</SUP></A> considers <I>P.
    pumilio,</I> with its several sub-varieties, as <I>mughus,
    nana,</I> etc., which differ much when planted in different soils,
    and only come "tolerably true from seed," as alpine varieties of
    the Scotch fir; if this were proved to be the case, it would be an
    interesting fact as showing that dwarfing from long exposure to a
    severe climate is to a certain extent inherited.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The <I>Hawthorn (Crat&#230;gus
    oxyacantha).</I> has varied much. Besides endless slighter
    variations in the form of the leaves, and in the size, hardness,
    fleshiness, and shape of the berries, Loudon<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>165</SUP></A> enumerates twenty-nine well-marked
    varieties. Besides those cultivated for their pretty flowers, there
    are others with golden-yellow, black, and whitish berries; others
    with woolly berries, and others with re-curved thorns. Loudon truly
    remarks that the chief reason why the hawthorn has yielded more
    varieties than most other trees, is that nurserymen select any
    remarkable variety out of the immense beds of seedlings which are
    annually raised for making hedges. The flowers of the hawthorn
    usually include from one to three pistils; but in two varieties,
    named monogyna and sibirica, there is only a single pistil; and
    d'Asso states that the common thorn in Spain is constantly in this
    state.<A href="#refer"><SUP>166</SUP></A> There is also a variety
    which is apetalous, or has its petals reduced to mere rudiments.
    The famous Glastonbury thorn flowers and leafs towards the end of

    notice that several varieties of the hawthorn, as well as of the

    extremely like each other;<A href="#refer"><SUP>168</SUP></A> thus

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I shall not for several reasons treat the
    variability of plants which are cultivated for their flowers alone
    at any great length. Many of our favourite kinds in their present
    state are the descendants of two or more species crossed and
    commingled together, and this circumstance alone would render it
    difficult to detect the difference due to variation. For instance,
    our Roses, Petunias, Calceolarias, Fuchsias, Verbenas, Gladioli,
    Pelargoniums, etc., certainly have had a multiple origin. A
    botanist well acquainted with the parent-forms would probably
    detect some curious structural differences in their crossed and
    cultivated descendant; and he would certainly observe many new and
    remarkable constitutional peculiarities. I will give a few
    instances, all relating to the Pelargonium, and taken chiefly from
    Mr. Beck,<A href="#refer"><SUP>169</SUP></A> a famous cultivator of
    this plant: some varieties require more water than others; some are
    "very impatient of the knife if too greedily used in making
    cuttings;" some, when potted, scarcely "show a root at the outside
    of the ball of the earth;" one variety requires a certain amount of
    confinement in the pot to make it throw up a flower-stem; some
    varieties bloom well at the commencement of the season, others at
    the close; one variety is known,<A href="#refer"><SUP>170</SUP></A>
    which will stand "even pine-apple top and bottom heat, without
    looking any more drawn than if it had stood in a common greenhouse;
    and Blanche Fleur seems as if made on purpose for growing in
    winter, like many bulbs, and to rest all summer." These odd
    constitutional peculiarities would enable a plant in a state of
    nature to become adapted to widely different circumstances and
    climates.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Flowers possess little interest under our
    present point of view, because they have been almost exclusively
    attended to and selected for their beautiful colour, size, perfect
    outline, and manner of growth. In these particulars hardly one
    long-cultivated flower can be named which has not varied greatly.
    What does a florist care for the shape and structure of the organs
    of fructification, unless, indeed, they add to the beauty of the
    flower? When this is the case, flowers become modified in important
    points; stamens and pistils may be converted into petals, and
    additional petals may be developed, as in all double flowers. The
    process of gradual selection by which flowers have been rendered
    more and more double, each step in the process of conversion being
    inherited, has been recorded in several instances. In the so-called
    double flowers of the Composit&#230;, the corollas of the central
    florets are greatly modified, and the modifications are likewise
    inherited. In the columbine (<I>Aquilegia vulgaris</I>) some of the
    stamens are converted into petals having the shape of nectaries,
    one neatly fitting into the other; but in one variety they are
    converted into simple petals.<A href="#refer"><SUP>171</SUP></A> In
    the "hose in hose" primul&#230;, the calyx becomes brightly
    coloured and enlarged so as to resemble a corolla; and Mr. W.
    Wooler informs me that this peculiarity is transmitted; for he
    crossed a common polyanthus with one having a coloured calyx,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>172</SUP></A> and some of the seedlings
    inherited the coloured calyx during at least six generations. In
    the "hen-and-chicken" daisy the main flower is surrounded by a
    brood of small flowers developed from buds in the axils of the
    scales of the involucre. A wonderful poppy has been described, in
    which the stamens are converted into pistils; and so strictly was
    this peculiarity inherited that, out of 154 seedlings, one alone
    reverted to the ordinary and common type.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>173</SUP></A> Of the cock's-comb (<I>Celosia
    cristata</I>), which is an annual, there are several races in which
    the flower-stem is wonderfully "fasciated" or compressed; and one
    has been exhibited<A href="#refer"><SUP>174</SUP></A> actually
    eighteen inches in breadth. Peloric races of <I>Gloxinia
    speciosa</I> and <I>Antirrhinum majus</I> can be propagated by
    seed, and they differ in a wonderful manner from the typical form
    both in structure and appearance.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>A much more remarkable modification has
    been recorded by Sir William and Dr. Hooker<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>175</SUP></A> in <I>Begonia frigida.</I> This plant
    properly produces male and female flowers on the same fascicles;
    and in the female flowers the perianth is superior; but a plant at
    Kew produced, besides the ordinary flowers, others which graduated
    towards a perfect hermaphrodite structure; and in these flowers the
    perianth was inferior. To show the importance of this modification
    under a classificatory point of view, I may quote what Prof. Harvey
    says, namely, that had it "occurred in a state of nature, and had a
    botanist collected a plant with such flowers, he would not only
    have placed it in a distinct genus from Begonia, but would probably
    have considered it as the type of a new natural order." This
    modification cannot in one sense be considered as a monstrosity,
    for analogous structures naturally occur in other orders, as with
    Saxifrag&#230; and Aristolochiace&#230;. The interest of the case
    is largely added to by Mr. C. W. Crocker's observation that
    seedlings from the <I>normal</I> flowers produced plants which
    bore, in about the same proportion as the parent-plant,
    hermaphrodite flowers having inferior perianths. The hermaphrodite
    flowers fertilised with their own pollen were sterile.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>If florists had attended to, selected,
    and propagated by seed other modifications of structure besides
    those which are beautiful, a host of curious varieties would
    certainly have been raised; and they would probably have
    transmitted their characters so truly that the cultivator would
    have felt aggrieved, as in the case of culinary vegetables, if his
    whole bed had not presented a uniform appearance. Florists have
    attended in some instances to the leaves of their plant, and have
    thus produced the most elegant and symmetrical patterns of white,
    red, and green, which, as in the case of the pelargonium, are
    sometimes strictly inherited.<A href="#refer"><SUP>176</SUP></A>
    Any one who will habitually examine highly-cultivated flowers in
    gardens and greenhouses will observe numerous deviations in
    structure; but most of these must be ranked as mere monstrosities,
    and are only so far interesting as showing how plastic the
    organisation becomes under high cultivation. From this point of
    view such works as Professor Moquin-Tandon's 'T&#233;ratologie' are
    highly instructive.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Roses.</I>&#8212;These flowers offer
    an instance of a number of forms generally ranked as species,
    namely, <I>R. centifolia, gallica, alba, damascena, spinosissima,
    bracteata, indica, semperflorens, moschata,</I> etc., which have
    largely varied and been intercrossed. The genus Rosa is a
    notoriously difficult one, and, though some of the above forms are
    admitted by all botanists to be distinct species, others are
    doubtful; thus, with respect to the British forms, Babington makes
    seventeen, and Bentham only five species. The hybrids from some of
    the most distinct forms&#8212;for instance, from <I>R. indica,</I>
    fertilised by the pollen of <I>R. centifolia</I>&#8212;produce an
    abundance of seed; I state this on the authority of Mr. Rivers,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>177</SUP></A> from whose work I have drawn most
    of the following statements. As almost all the aboriginal forms
    brought from different countries have been crossed and re-crossed,
    it is no wonder that Targioni-Tozzetti, in speaking of the common
    roses of the Italian gardens, remarks that "the native country and
    precise form of the wild type of most of them are involved in much
    uncertainty."<A href="#refer"><SUP>178</SUP></A> Nevertheless, Mr.
    Rivers in referring to <I>R. indica</I> (p. 68) says that the
    descendants of each group may generally be recognised by a close
    observer. The same author often speaks of roses as having been a
    little hybridised; but it is evident that in very many cases the
    differences due to variation and to hybridisation can now only be
    conjecturally distinguished.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The species have varied both by seed and
    by bud; such modified buds being often called by gardeners sports.
    In the following chapter I shall fully discuss this latter subject,
    and shall show that bud-variations can be propagated not only by
    grafting and budding, but often by seed. Whenever a new rose
    appears with any peculiar character, however produced, if it yields
    seed, Mr. Rivers (p. 4) fully expects it to become the parent-type
    of a new family. The tendency to vary is so strong in some kinds,
    as in the Village Maid (Rivers, p. 16), that when grown in
    different soils it varies so much in colour that it has been
    thought to form several distinct kinds. Altogether the number of
    kinds is very great: thus M. Desportes, in his Catalogue for 1829,
    enumerates 2562 as cultivated in France; but no doubt a large
    proportion of these are merely nominal.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It would be useless to specify the many
    points of difference between the various kinds, but some
    constitutional peculiarities may be mentioned. Several French roses
    (Rivers, p. 12) will not succeed in England; and an excellent
    horticulturist<A href="#refer"><SUP>179</SUP></A> remarks, that
    "Even in the same garden you will find that a rose that will do
    nothing under a south wall will do well under a north one. That is
    the case with Paul Joseph here. It grows strongly and blooms
    beautifully close to a north wall. For three years seven plants
    have done nothing under a south wall." Many roses can be forced,
    "many are totally unfit for forcing, among which is General
    Jacqueminot."<A href="#refer"><SUP>180</SUP></A> From the effects
    of crossing and variation Mr. Rivers enthusiastically anticipates
    (p. 87) that the day will come when all our roses, even moss-roses,
    will have evergreen foliage, brilliant and fragrant flowers, and
    the habit of blooming from June till November. "A distant view this
    seems, but perseverance in gardening will yet achieve wonders," as
    assuredly it has already achieved wonders.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It may be worth while briefly to give the
    well-known history of one class of roses. In 1793 some wild Scotch
    roses (<I>R. spinosissima</I>) were transplanted into a garden;<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>181</SUP></A> and one of these bore flowers
    slightly tinged with red, from which a plant was raised with
    semi-monstrous flowers, also tinged with red; seedlings from this
    flower were semi-double, and by continued selection, in about nine
    or ten years, eight sub-varieties were raised. In the course of
    less than twenty years these double Scotch roses had so much
    increased in number and kind, that twenty-six well-marked
    varieties, classed in eight sections, were described by Mr. Sabine.
    In 1841<A href="#refer"><SUP>182</SUP></A> it is said that three
    hundred varieties could be procured in the nursery-gardens near
    Glasgow; and these are described as blush, crimson, purple, red,
    marbled, two-coloured, white, and yellow, and as differing much in
    the size and shape of the flower.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Pansy or Heartsease (Viola tricolor,
    etc.).</I>&#8212;The history of this flower seems to be pretty well
    known; it was grown in Evelyn's garden in 1687; but the varieties
    were not attended to till 1810-1812, when Lady Monke, together with
    Mr. Lee, the well-known nursery-man, energetically commenced their
    culture; and in the course of a few years twenty varieties could be
    purchased.<A href="#refer"><SUP>183</SUP></A> At about the same
    period, namely in 1813 or 1814, Lord Gambier collected some wild
    plants, and his gardener, Mr. Thomson, cultivated them, together
    with some common garden varieties, and soon effected a great
    improvement. The first great change was the conversion of the dark
    lines in the centre of the flower into a dark eye or centre, which
    at that period had never been seen, but is now considered one of
    the chief requisites of a first-rate flower. In 1835 a book
    entirely devoted to this flower was published, and four hundred
    named varieties were on sale. From these circumstances this plant
    seemed to me worth studying, more especially from the great
    contrast between the small, dull, elongated, irregular flowers of
    the wild pansy, and the beautiful, flat, symmetrical, circular,
    velvet-like flowers, more than two inches in diameter,
    magnificently and variously coloured, which are exhibited at our
    shows. But when I came to enquire more closely, I found that,
    though the varieties were so modern, yet that much confusion and
    doubt prevailed about their parentage. Florists believe that the
    varieties<A href="#refer"><SUP>184</SUP></A> are descended from
    several wild stocks, namely, <I>V. tricolor, lutea, grandiflora,
    am&#339;na,</I> and <I>altaica,</I> more or less intercrossed. And
    when I looked to botanical works to ascertain whether these forms
    ought to be ranked as species, I found equal doubt and confusion.
    <I>Viola altaica</I> seems to be a distinct form, but what part it
    has played in the origin of our varieties I know not; it is said to
    have been crossed with <I>V. lutea. Viola am&#339;na</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>185</SUP></A> is now looked at by all botanists as a
    natural variety of <I>V. grandiflora</I>; and this and <I>V.
    sudetica</I> have been proved to be identical with <I>V. lutea.</I>
    The latter and <I>V. tricolor</I> (including its admitted variety
    <I>V. arvensis</I>) are ranked as distinct species by Babington,
    and likewise by M. Gay,<A href="#refer"><SUP>186</SUP></A> who has
    paid particular attention to the genus; but the specific
    distinction between <I>V. lutea</I> and <I>tricolor</I> is chiefly
    grounded on the one being strictly and the other not strictly
    perennial, as well as on some other slight and unimportant
    differences in the form of the stem and stipules. Bentham unites
    these two forms; and a high authority on such matters, Mr. H. C.
    Watson,<A href="#refer"><SUP>187</SUP></A> says that, "while <I>V.
    tricolor</I> passes into <I>V. arvensis</I> on the one side, it
    approximates so much towards <I>V. lutea</I> and <I>V. Curtisii</I>
    on the other side, that a distinction becomes scarcely more easy
    between them."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Hence, after having carefully compared
    numerous varieties, I gave up the attempt as too difficult for any
    one except a professed botanist. Most of the varieties present such
    inconstant characters, that when grown in poor soil, or when
    flowering out of their proper season, they produced differently
    coloured and much smaller flowers. Cultivators speak of this or
    that kind as being remarkably constant or true; but by this they do
    not mean, as in other cases, that the kind transmits its character
    by seed, but that the individual plant does not change much under
    culture. The principle of inheritance, however, does hold good to a
    certain extent even with the fleeting varieties of the Heartsease,
    for to gain good sorts it is indispensable to sow the seed of good
    sorts. Nevertheless, in almost every large seed-bed a few, almost
    wild seedlings reappear through reversion. On comparing the
    choicest varieties with the nearest allied wild forms, besides the
    difference in the size, outline, and colour of the flowers, the
    leaves sometimes differ in shape, as does the calyx occasionally in
    the length and breadth of the sepals. The differences in the form
    of the nectary more especially deserve notice; because characters
    derived from this organ have been much used in the discrimination
    of most of the species of Viola. In a large number of flowers
    compared in 1842 I found that in the greater number the nectary was
    straight; in others the extremity was a little turned upwards, or
    downwards, or inwards, so as to be completely hooked; in others,
    instead of being hooked, it was first turned rectangularly
    downwards, and then backwards and upwards; in others, the extremity
    was considerably enlarged; and lastly, in some the basal part was
    depressed, becoming, as usual, laterally compressed towards the
    extremity. In a large number of flowers, on the other hand,
    examined by me in 1856 from a nursery-garden in a different part of
    England, the nectary hardly varied at all. Now M. Gay says that in
    certain districts, especially in Auvergne, the nectary of the wild
    <I>V. grandiflora</I> varies in the manner just described. Must we
    conclude from this that the cultivated varieties first mentioned
    were all descended from <I>V. grandiflora,</I> and that the second
    lot, though having the same general appearance, were descended from
    <I>V. tricolor,</I> of which the nectary, according to M. Gay, is
    subject to little variation? Or is it not more probable that both
    these wild forms would be found under other conditions to vary in
    the same manner and degree, thus showing that they ought not to be
    ranked as specifically distinct?</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The <I>Dahlia</I> has been referred to
    by almost every author who has written on the variation of plants,
    because it is believed that all the varieties are descended from a
    single species, and because all have arisen since 1802 in France,
    and since 1804 in England.<A href="#refer"><SUP>188</SUP></A> Mr.
    Sabine remarks that "it seems as if some period of cultivation had
    been required before the fixed qualities of the native plant gave
    way and began to sport into those changes which now so delight
    us."<A href="#refer"><SUP>189</SUP></A> The flowers have been
    greatly modified in shape from a flat to a globular form. Anemone
    and ranunculus-like races<A href="#refer"><SUP>190</SUP></A> which
    differ in the form and arrangement of the florets, have arisen;
    also dwarfed races, one of which is only eighteen inches in height.
    The seeds vary much in size. The petals are uniformly coloured or
    tipped or striped, and present an almost infinite diversity of
    tints. Seedlings of fourteen different colours<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>191</SUP></A> have been raised from the same plant;
    yet, as Mr. Sabine has remarked, "many of the seedlings follow
    their parents in colour." The period of flowering has been
    considerably hastened, and this has probably been effected by
    continued selection. Salisbury, writing 1808, says that they then
    flowered from September to November; in 1828 some new dwarf
    varieties began flowering in June;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>192</SUP></A> and Mr. Grieve informs me that the
    dwarf purple Zelinda in his garden is in full bloom by the middle
    of June and sometimes even earlier. Slight constitutional
    differences have been observed between certain varieties: thus,
    some kinds succeed much better in one part of England than in
    another;<A href="#refer"><SUP>193</SUP></A> and it has been noticed
    that some varieties require much more moisture than others.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>194</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Such flowers as the carnation, common
    tulip, and hyacinth, which are believed to be descended, each from
    a single wild form, present innumerable varieties, differing almost
    exclusively in the size, form, and colour of the flowers. These and
    some other anciently cultivated plants which have been long
    propagated by offsets, pipings, bulbs, etc., become so excessively
    variable, that almost each new plant raised from seed forms a new
    variety, "all of which to describe particularly," as old Gerarde
    wrote in 1597, "were to roll Sisyphus's stone, or to number the
    sands."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Hyacinth (Hyacinthus
    orientalis).</I>&#8212;It may, however, be worth while to give a
    short account of this plant, which was introduced into England in
    1596 from the Levant.<A href="#refer"><SUP>195</SUP></A> The petals
    of the original flower, says Mr. Paul, were narrow, wrinkled,
    pointed, and of a flimsy texture; now they are broad, smooth,
    solid, and rounded. The erectness, breadth, and length of the whole
    spike, and the size of the flowers, have all increased. The colours
    have been intensified and diversified. Gerarde, in 1597, enumerates
    four, and Parkinson, in 1629, eight varieties. Now the varieties
    are very numerous, and they were still more numerous a century ago.
    Mr. Paul remarks that "it is interesting to compare the Hyacinths
    of 1629 with those of 1864, and to mark the improvement. Two
    hundred and thirty-five years have elapsed since then, and this
    simple flower serves well to illustrate the great fact that the
    original forms of nature do not remain fixed and stationary, at
    least when brought under cultivation. While looking at the
    extremes, we must not, however, forget that there are intermediate
    stages which are for the most part lost to us. Nature will
    sometimes indulge herself with a leap, but as a rule her march is
    slow and gradual." He adds that the cultivator should have "in his
    mind an ideal of beauty, for the realisation of which he works with
    head and hand." We thus see how clearly Mr. Paul, an eminently
    successful cultivator of this flower, appreciates the action of
    methodical selection.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In a curious and apparently trustworthy
    treatise, published at Amsterdam<A href="#refer"><SUP>196</SUP></A>
    in 1768, it is stated that nearly 2,000 sorts were then known; but
    in 1864 Mr. Paul found only 700 in the largest garden at Haarlem.
    In this treatise it is said that not an instance is known of any
    one variety reproducing itself truly by seed: the white kinds,
    however, now<A href="#refer"><SUP>197</SUP></A> almost always yield
    white hyacinths, and the yellow kinds come nearly true. The
    hyacinth is remarkable from having given rise to varieties with
    bright blue, pink, and distinctly yellow flowers. These three
    primary colours do not occur in the varieties of any other species;
    nor do they often all occur even in the distinct species of the
    same genus. Although the several kinds of hyacinths differ but
    slightly from each other except in colour, yet each kind has its
    own individual character, which can be recognised by a highly
    educated eye; thus the writer of the Amsterdam treatise asserts (p.
    43) that some experienced florists, such as the famous G. Voorhelm,
    seldom failed in a collection of above twelve hundred sorts to
    recognise each variety by the bulb alone! This same writer mentions
    some few singular variations: for instance, the hyacinth commonly
    produces six leaves, but there is one kind (p. 35) which scarcely
    ever has more than three leaves; another never more than five;
    whilst others regularly produce either seven or eight leaves. A
    variety, called la Coryphee, invariably produces (p. 116) two
    flower-stems, united together and covered by one skin. The
    flower-stem in another kind (p. 128) comes out of the ground in a
    coloured sheath, before the appearance of the leaves, and is
    consequently liable to suffer from frost. Another variety always
    pushes a second flower-stem after the first has begun to develop
    itself. Lastly, white hyacinths with red, purple, or violet centres
    (p. 129) are the most liable to rot. Thus, the hyacinth, like so
    many previous plants, when long cultivated and closely watched, is
    found to offer many singular variations.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the two last chapters I have given in some
    detail the range of variation, and the history, as far as known, of
    a considerable number of plants, which have been cultivated for
    various purposes. But some of the most variable plants, such as
    Kidney-beans, Capsicum, Millets, Sorghum, etc., have been passed
    over; for botanists are not at all agreed which kinds ought to rank
    as species and which as varieties; and the wild parent-species are
    unknown.<A href="#refer"><SUP>198</SUP></A> Many plants long
    cultivated in tropical countries, such as the Banana, have produced
    numerous varieties; but as these have never been described with
    even moderate care, they are here also passed over. Nevertheless, a
    sufficient, and perhaps more than sufficient, number of cases have
    been given, so that the reader may be enabled to judge for himself
    on the nature and great amount of variation which cultivated plants
    have undergone.</P>

      this country it is said (vol. ii. p. 163) that it was more
      injurious to crab-stocks than to the apples grafted on them. The
      Majetin apple has been found equally free of the coccus at
      Melbourne in Australia ('Gard. Chron.,' 1871, p. 1065). The wood
      of this tree has been there analysed, and it is said (but the
      fact seems a strange one) that its ash contained over 50 per cent
      of lime, while that of the crab exhibited not quite 23 per cent.
      In Tasmania Mr. Wade ('Transact. New Zealand Institute,' vol. iv.
      1871, p. 431) raised seedlings of the Siberian Bitter Sweet for
      stocks, and he found barely one per cent of them attacked by the
      coccus. Riley shows ('Fifth Report on Insects of Missouri,' 1873,
      p. 87) that in the United States some varieties of apples are
      highly attractive to the coccus and others very little so.
      Turning to a very different pest, namely, the caterpillar of a
      moth (<I>Carpocapsa pomonella</I>), Walsh affirms ('The American
      Entomologist,' April, 1869, p. 160) that the maiden-blush "is
      entirely exempt from apple-worms." So, it is said, are some few
      other varieties; whereas others are "peculiarly subject to the
      attacks of this little pest."</FONT></LI>
