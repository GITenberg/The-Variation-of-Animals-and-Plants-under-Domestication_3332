    <P align="JUSTIFY">The great principle of inheritance to be
    discussed in this chapter has been recognised by agriculturists and
    authors of various nations, as shown by the scientific term <I>
    Atavism,</I> derived from atavus, an ancestor; by the English terms
    of <I>Reversion,</I> or <I>Throwing-back</I>; by the French <I>
    Pas-en-Arri&#232;re</I>; and by the German <I>R&#252;ckschlag,</I>
    or <I>R&#252;ckschritt.</I> When the child resembles either
    grandparent more closely than its immediate parents, our attention
    is not much arrested, though in truth the fact is highly
    remarkable; but when the child resembles some remote ancestor or
    some distant member in a collateral line,&#8212;and in the last
    case we must attribute this to the descent of all the members from
    a common progenitor,&#8212;we feel a just degree of astonishment.
    When one parent alone displays some newly-acquired and generally
    inheritable character, and the offspring do not inherit it, the
    cause may lie in the other parent having the power of prepotent
    transmission. But when both parents are similarly characterised,
    and the child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit the
    character in question, but resembles its grandparents, we have one
    of the simplest cases of reversion. We continually see another and
    even more simple case of atavism, though not generally included
    under this head, namely, when the son more closely resembles his
    maternal than his paternal grand-sire in some male attribute, as in
    any peculiarity in the beard of man, the horns of the bull, the
    hackles or comb of the cock, or, as in certain diseases necessarily
    confined to the male sex; for as the mother cannot possess or
    exhibit such male attributes, the child must inherit them, through
    her blood, from his maternal grandsire.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> The cases of reversion may be divided into two
    main classes which, however, in some instances, blend into one
    another; namely, first, those occurring in a variety or race which
    has not been crossed, but has lost by variation some character that
    it formerly possessed, and which afterwards reappears. The second
    class includes all cases in which an individual with some
    distinguishable character, a race, or species, has at some former
    period been crossed, and a character derived from this cross, after
    having disappeared during one or several generations, suddenly
    reappears. A third class, differing only in the manner of
    reproduction, might be formed to include all cases of reversion
    effected by means of buds, and therefore independent of true or
    seminal generation. Perhaps even a fourth class might be
    instituted, to include reversions by segments in the same
    individual flower or fruit, and in different parts of the body in
    the same individual animal as it grows old. But the two first main
    classes will be sufficient for our purpose.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Reversion to lost Characters by pure or
    uncrossed forms.</I>&#8212;Striking instances of this first class
    of cases were given in the sixth chapter, namely, of the occasional
    reappearance, in variously-coloured breeds of the pigeon, of blue
    birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild <I>Columba
    livia.</I> Similar cases were given in the case of the fowl. With
    the common ass, as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost
    always striped, we may feel assured that the occasional appearance
    of such stripes in the domestic animal is a case of simple
    reversion. But I shall be compelled to refer again to these cases,
    and therefore here pass them over.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The aboriginal species from which our
    domesticated cattle and sheep are descended, no doubt possessed
    horns; but several hornless breeds are now well established. Yet in
    these&#8212;for instance, in Southdown sheep&#8212;"it is not
    unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns." The
    horns, which thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds,
    either "grow to the full size," or are curiously attached to the
    skin alone and hang "loosely down, or drop off."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> The Galloways and Suffolk cattle have
    been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years, but a horned calf,
    with the horn often loosely attached, is occasionally produced.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is reason to believe that sheep in their
    early domesticated condition were "brown or dingy black;" but even
    in the time of David certain flocks were spoken of as white as
    snow. During the classical period the sheep of Spain are described
    by several ancient authors as being black, red, or tawny.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> At the present day, notwithstanding the
    great care which is taken to prevent it, particoloured lambs and
    some entirely black are occasionally, or even frequently, dropped
    by our most highly improved and valued breeds, such as the
    Southdowns. Since the time of the famous Bakewell, during the last
    century, the Leicester sheep have been bred with the most
    scrupulous care; yet occasionally grey-faced, or black-spotted, or
    wholly black lambs appear.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> This
    occurs still more frequently with the less improved breeds, such as
    the Norfolks.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> As bearing on this
    tendency in sheep to revert to dark colours, I may state (though in
    doing so I trench on the reversion of crossed breeds, and likewise
    on the subject of prepotency) that the Rev. W. D. Fox was informed
    that seven white Southdown ewes were put to a so-called Spanish
    ram, which had two small black spots on his sides, and they
    produced thirteen lambs, all perfectly black. Mr. Fox believes that
    this ram belonged to a breed which he has himself kept, and which
    is always spotted with black and white; and he finds that Leicester
    sheep crossed by rams of this breed always produce black lambs: he
    has gone on recrossing these crossed sheep with pure white
    Leicesters during three successive generations, but always with the
    same result. Mr. Fox was also told by the friend from whom the
    spotted breed was procured, that he likewise had gone on for six or
    seven generations crossing with white sheep, but still black lambs
    were invariably produced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Similar facts could be given with respect to
    tailless breeds of various animals. For instance, Mr. Hewitt<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> states that chickens bred from some
    rumpless fowls, which were reckoned so good that they won a prize
    at an exhibition, "in a considerable number of instances were
    furnished with fully developed tail-feathers." On inquiry, the
    original breeder of these fowls stated that, from the time when he
    had first kept them, they had often produced fowls furnished with
    tails; but that these latter would again reproduce rumpless
    chickens.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Analogous cases of reversion occur in the
    vegetable kingdom; thus "from seeds gathered from the finest
    cultivated varieties of Heartsease (<I>Viola tricolor</I>), plants
    perfectly wild both in their foliage and their flowers are
    frequently produced;"<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> but the
    reversion in this instance is not to a very ancient period, for the
    best existing varieties of the heartsease are of comparatively
    modern origin. With most of our cultivated vegetables there is some
    tendency to reversion to what is known to be, or may be presumed to
    be, their aboriginal state; and this would be more evident if
    gardeners did not generally look over their beds of seedlings, and
    pull up the false plants or "rogues" as they are called. It has
    already been remarked, that some few seedling apples and pears
    generally resemble, but apparently are not identical with, the wild
    trees from which they are descended. In our turnip<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> and carrot-beds a few plants often "break
    "&#8212;that is, flower too soon; and their roots are generally
    hard and stringy, as in the parent-species. By the aid of a little
    selection, carried on during a few generations, most of our
    cultivated plants could probably be brought back, without any great
    change in their conditions of life, to a wild or nearly wild
    condition: Mr. Buckman has effected this with the parsnip;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and Mr. Hewett C. Watson, as he informs
    me, selected, during three generations, "the most diverging plants
    of Scotch kail, perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the
    cabbage; and in the third generation some of the plants came very
    close to the forms now established in England about old
    castle-walls, and called indigenous."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Reversion in Animals and Plants which have
    run wild.</I>&#8212;In the cases hitherto considered, the reverting
    animals and plants have not been exposed to any great or abrupt
    change in their conditions of life which could have induced this
    tendency; but it is very different with animals and plants which
    have become feral or run wild. It has been repeatedly asserted in
    the most positive manner by various authors, that feral animals and
    plants invariably return to their primitive specific type. It is
    curious on what little evidence this belief rests. Many of our
    domesticated animals could not subsist in a wild state; thus, the
    more highly improved breeds of the pigeon will not "field" or
    search for their own food. Sheep have never become feral, and would
    be destroyed by almost every beast of prey.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> In several cases we do not know the
    aboriginal parent-species, and cannot possibly tell whether or not
    there has been any close degree of reversion. It is not known in
    any instance what variety was first turned out; several varieties
    have probably in some cases run wild, and their crossing alone
    would tend to obliterate their proper character. Our domesticated
    animals and plants, when they run wild, must always be exposed to
    new conditions of life, for, as Mr. Wallace<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> has well remarked, they have to obtain
    their own food, and are exposed to competition with the native
    productions. Under these circumstances, if our domesticated animals
    did not undergo change of some kind, the result would be quite
    opposed to the conclusions arrived at in this work. Nevertheless, I
    do not doubt that the simple fact of animals and plants becoming
    feral, does cause some tendency to reversion to the primitive
    state; though this tendency has been much exaggerated by some
    authors.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will briefly run through the recorded
    cases. With neither horses nor cattle is the primitive stock known;
    and it has been shown in former chapters that they have assumed
    different colours in different countries. Thus the horses which
    have run wild in South America are generally brownish-bay, and in
    the East dun-coloured; their heads have become larger and coarser,
    and this may be due to reversion. No careful description has been
    given of the feral goat. Dogs which have run wild in various
    countries have hardly anywhere assumed a uniform character; but
    they are probably descended from several domestic races, and
    aboriginally from several distinct species. Feral cats, both in
    Europe and La Plata, are regularly striped; in some cases they have
    grown to an unusually large size, but do not differ from the
    domestic animal in any other character. When variously-coloured
    tame rabbits are turned out in Europe, they generally reacquire the
    colouring of the wild animal; there can be no doubt that this does
    really occur, but we should remember that oddly-coloured and
    conspicuous animals would suffer much from beasts of prey and from
    being easily shot; this at least was the opinion of a gentleman who
    tried to stock his woods with a nearly white variety; if thus
    destroyed, they would be supplanted by, instead of being
    transformed into, the common rabbit. We have seen that the feral
    rabbits of Jamaica, and especially of Porto Santo, have assumed new
    colours and other new characters. The best known case of reversion,
    and that on which the widely spread belief in its universality
    apparently rests, is that of pigs. These animals have run wild in
    the West Indies, South America, and the Falkland Islands, and have
    everywhere acquired the dark colour, the thick bristles, and great
    tusks of the wild boar; and the young have reacquired longitudinal
    stripes. But even in the case of the pig, Roulin describes the
    half-wild animals in different parts of South America as differing
    in several respects. In Louisiana the pig<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> has run wild, and is said to differ a
    little in form, and much in colour, from the domestic animal, yet
    does not closely resemble the wild boar of Europe. With pigeons and
    fowls,<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> it is not known what
    variety was first turned out, nor what character the feral birds
    have assumed. The guinea-fowl in the West Indies, when feral, seems
    to vary more than in the domesticated state.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to plants run wild, Dr.
    Hooker<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> has strongly insisted on
    what slight evidence the common belief in their reversion to a
    primitive state rests. Godron<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
    describes wild turnips, carrots, and celery; but these plants in
    their cultivated state hardly differ from their wild prototypes,
    except in the succulency and enlargement of certain parts,&#8212;
    characters which would certainly be lost by plants growing in poor
    soil and struggling with other plants. No cultivated plant has run
    wild on so enormous a scale as the cardoon (<I>Cynara
    cardunculus</I>) in La Plata. Every botanist who has seen it
    growing there, in vast beds, as high as a horse's back, has been
    struck with its peculiar appearance; but whether it differs in any
    important point from the cultivated Spanish form, which is said not
    to be prickly like its American descendant, or whether it differs
    from the wild Mediterranean species, which is said not to be social
    (though this may be due merely to the nature of the conditions), I
    do not know.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Reversion to Characters derived from a Cross,
    in the case of Sub-varieties, Races, and Species.</I>&#8212;When an
    individual having some recognisable peculiarity unites with another
    of the same sub-variety, not having the peculiarity in question, it
    often reappears in the descendants after an interval of several
    generations. Every one must have noticed, or heard from old people
    of children closely resembling in appearance or mental disposition,
    or in so small and complex a character as expression, one of their
    grandparents, or some more distant collateral relation. Very many
    anomalies of structure and diseases<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> of which instances have been given in
    the last chapter, have come into a family from one parent, and have
    reappeared in the progeny after passing over two or three
    generations. The following case has been communicated to me on good
    authority, and may, I believe, be fully trusted: a pointer-bitch
    produced seven puppies; four were marked with blue and white, which
    is so unusual a colour with pointers that she was thought to have
    played false with one of the greyhounds, and the whole litter was
    condemned; but the gamekeeper was permitted to save one as a
    curiosity. Two years afterwards a friend of the owner saw the young
    dog, and declared that he was the image of his old pointer-bitch
    Sappho, the only blue and white pointer of pure descent which he
    had ever seen. This led to close inquiry, and it was proved that he
    was the great-great-grandson of Sappho; so that, according to the
    common expression, he had only 1/16th of her blood in his veins. I
    may give one other instance, on the authority of Mr. R. Walker, a
    large cattle-breeder in Kincardineshire. He bought a black bull,
    the son of a black cow with white legs, white belly and part of the
    tail white; and in 1870 a calf the gr.-gr.-gr.-gr.-grandchild of
    this cow was born coloured in the same very peculiar manner; all
    the intermediate offspring having been black. In these cases there
    can hardly be a doubt that a character derived from a cross with an
    individual of the same variety reappeared after passing over three
    generations in the one case, and five in the other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When two distinct races are crossed, it is
    notorious that the tendency in the offspring to revert to one or
    both parent-forms is strong, and endures for many generations. I
    have myself seen the clearest evidence of this in crossed pigeons
    and with various plants. Mr. Sidney<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> states that, in a litter of Essex pigs,
    two young ones appeared which were the image of the Berkshire boar
    that had been used twenty-eight years before in giving size and
    constitution to the breed. I observed in the farmyard at Betley
    Hall some fowls showing a strong likeness to the Malay breed, and
    was told by Mr. Tollet that he had forty years before crossed his
    birds with Malays; and that, though he had at first attempted to
    get rid of this strain, he had subsequently given up the attempt in
    despair, as the Malay character would reappear.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert
    has given rise to endless discussions in how many generations after
    a single cross, either with a distinct breed or merely with an
    inferior animal, the breed may be considered as pure, and free from
    all danger of reversion. No one supposes that less than three
    generations suffices, and most breeders think that six, seven, or
    eight are necessary, and some go to still greater lengths.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> But neither in the case of a breed which
    has been contaminated by a single cross, nor when, in the attempt
    to form an intermediate breed, half-bred animals have been matched
    together during many generations, can any rule be laid down how
    soon the tendency to reversion will be obliterated. It depends on
    the difference in the strength or prepotency of transmission in the
    two parent-forms, on their actual amount of difference, and on the
    nature of the conditions of life to which the crossed offspring are
    exposed. But we must be careful not to confound these cases of
    reversion to characters which were gained by a cross, with those
    under the first class, in which characters originally common to
    BOTH parents, but lost at some former period, reappear; for such
    characters may recur after an almost indefinite number of
    generations.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The law of reversion is as powerful with
    hybrids, when they are sufficiently fertile to breed together, or
    when they are repeatedly crossed with either pure parent-form, as
    in the case of mongrels. It is not necessary to give instances.
    With plants almost every one who has worked on this subject, from
    the time of K&#246;lreuter to the present day, has insisted on this
    tendency. G&#228;rtner has recorded some good instances; but no one
    has given more striking ones than Naudin.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> The tendency differs in degree or
    strength in different groups, and partly depends, as we shall
    presently see, on whether the parent-plants have been long
    cultivated. Although the tendency to reversion is extremely general
    with nearly all mongrels and hybrids, it cannot be considered as
    invariably characteristic of them; it may also be mastered by
    long-continued selection; but these subjects will more properly be
    discussed in a future chapter on Crossing. From what we see of the
    power and scope of reversion, both in pure races, and when
    varieties or species are crossed, we may infer that characters of
    almost every kind are capable of reappearing after having been lost
    for a great length of time. But it does not follow from this that
    in each particular case certain characters will reappear; for
    instance, this will not occur when a race is crossed with another
    endowed with prepotency of transmission. Sometimes the power of
    reversion wholly fails, without our being able to assign any cause
    for the failure: thus it has been stated that in a French family in
    which 85 out of above 600 members, during six generations, had been
    subject to night-blindness, "there has not been a single example of
    this affection in the children of parents who were themselves free
    from it."<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Reversion through
    Bud-propagation&#8212;Partial Reversion, by segments in the same
    flower or fruit, or in different parts of the body in the same
    individual animal.</I>&#8212;In the eleventh chapter many cases of
    reversion by buds, independently of seminal generation, were
    given&#8212;as when a leaf-bud on a variegated, a curled, or
    laciniated variety suddenly reassumes its proper character; or as
    when a Provence-rose appears on a moss-rose, or a peach on a
    nectarine-tree. In some of these cases only half the flower or
    fruit, or a smaller segment, or mere stripes, reassume their former
    character; and here we have reversion by segments. Vilmorin<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> has also recorded several cases with
    plants derived from seed, of flowers reverting by stripes or
    blotches to their primitive colours: he states that in all such
    cases a white or pale-coloured variety must first be formed, and,
    when this is propagated for a length of time by seed, striped
    seedlings occasionally make their appearance; and these can
    afterwards by care be multiplied by seed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The stripes and segments just referred to are
    not due, as far as is known, to reversion to characters derived
    from a cross, but to characters lost by variation. These cases,
    however, as Naudin<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> insists in his
    discussion on disjunction of character, are closely analogous with
    those given in the eleventh chapter, in which crossed plants have
    been known to produce half-and-half or striped flowers and fruit,
    or distinct kinds of flowers on the same root resembling the two
    parent-forms. Many piebald animals probably come under this same
    head. Such cases, as we shall see in the chapter on Crossing,
    apparently result from certain characters not readily blending
    together, and, as a consequence of this incapacity for fusion, the
    offspring either perfectly resemble one of their two parents, or
    resemble one parent in one part, and the other parent in another
    part; or whilst young are intermediate in character, but with
    advancing age revert wholly or by segments to either parent-form,
    or to both. Thus, young trees of the <I>Cytisus</I> adami are
    intermediate in foliage and flowers between the two parent-forms;
    but when older the buds continually revert either partially or
    wholly to both forms. The cases given in the eleventh chapter on
    the changes which occurred during growth in crossed plants of
    Trop&#230;olum, Cereus, Datura, and Lathyrus are all analogous. As,
    however, these plants are hybrids of the first generation, and as
    their buds after a time come to resemble their parents and not
    their grandparents, these cases do not at first appear to come
    under the law of reversion in the ordinary sense of the word;
    nevertheless, as the change is effected through a succession of
    bud-generations on the same plant, they may be thus included.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Analogous facts have been observed in the animal
    kingdom, and are more remarkable, as they occur in the same
    individual in the strictest sense, and not as with plants through a
    succession of bud-generations. With animals the act of reversion,
    if it can be so designated, does not pass over a true generation,
    but merely over the early stages of growth in the same individual.
    For instance, I crossed several white hens with a black cock, and
    many of the chickens were, during the first year, perfectly white,
    but acquired during the second year black feathers; on the other
    hand, some of the chickens which were at first black, became during
    the second year piebald with white. A great breeder<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> says, that a Pencilled Brahma hen which
    has any of the blood of the Light Brahma in her, will "occasionally
    produce a pullet well pencilled during the first year, but she will
    most likely moult brown on the shoulders and become quite unlike
    her original colours in the second year." The same thing occurs
    with light Brahmas if of impure blood. I have observed exactly
    similar cases with the crossed offspring from differently coloured
    pigeons. But here is a more remarkable fact: I crossed a turbit,
    which has a frill formed by the feathers being reversed on its
    breast, with a trumpeter; and one of the young pigeons thus raised
    at first showed not a trace of the frill, but, after moulting
    thrice, a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared on its
    breast. According to Girou<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> calves
    produced from a red cow by a black bull, or from a black cow by a
    red bull, are not rarely born red, and subsequently become black. I
    possess a dog, the daughter of a white terrier by a fox-coloured
    bulldog; as a puppy she was quite white, but when about six months
    old a black spot appeared on her nose, and brown spots on her ears.
    When a little older she was badly wounded on the back, and the hair
    which grew on the cicatrix was of a brown colour, apparently
    derived from her father. This is the more remarkable, as with most
    animals having coloured hair, that which grows on a wounded surface
    is white.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the foregoing cases, the characters which
    with advancing age reappeared, were present in the immediately
    preceding generations; but characters sometimes reappear in the
    same manner after a much longer interval of time. Thus the calves
    of a hornless race of cattle which originated in Corrientes, though
    at first quite hornless, as they become adult sometimes acquire
    small, crooked, and loose horns; and these in succeeding years
    occasionally become attached to the skull.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> White and black Bantams, both of which
    generally breed true, sometimes assume as they grow old a saffron
    or red plumage. For instance, a first-rate black bantam has been
    described, which during three seasons was perfectly black, but then
    annually became more and more red; and it deserves notice that this
    tendency to change, whenever it occurs in a bantam, "is almost
    certain to prove hereditary."<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> The
    cuckoo or blue-mottled Dorking cock, when old, is liable to acquire
    yellow or orange hackles in place of his proper bluish-grey
    hackles.<A href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> Now as <I>Gallus
    bankiva</I> is coloured red and orange, and as Dorking fowls and
    bantams are descended from this species, we can hardly doubt that
    the change which occasionally occurs in the plumage of these birds
    as their age advances, results from a tendency in the individual to
    revert to the primitive type.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Crossing as a direct cause of
    Reversion.</I>&#8212;It has long been notorious that hybrids and
    mongrels often revert to both or to one of their parent-forms,
    after an interval of from two to seven or eight, or, according to
    some authorities, even a greater number of generations. But that
    the act of crossing in itself gives an impulse towards reversion,
    as shown by the reappearance of long-lost characters, has never, I
    believe, been hitherto proved. The proof lies in certain
    peculiarities, which do not characterise the immediate parents, and
    therefore cannot have been derived from them, frequently appearing
    in the offspring of two breeds when crossed, which peculiarities
    never appear, or appear with extreme rarity, in these same breeds,
    as long as they are precluded from crossing. As this conclusion
    seems to me highly curious and novel, I will give the evidence in
    detail.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>My attention was first called to this
    subject, and I was led to make numerous experiments, by MM. Boitard
    and Corbie having stated that, when they crossed certain breeds of
    pigeons, birds coloured like the wild <I>C. livia,</I> or the
    common dovecote&#8212;namely, slaty-blue, with double black
    wing-bars, sometimes chequered with black, white loins, the tail
    barred with black, with the outer feathers edged with
    white,&#8212;were almost invariably produced. The breeds which I
    crossed, and the remarkable results attained, have been fully
    described in the sixth chapter. I selected pigeons belonging to
    true and ancient breeds, which had not a trace of blue or any of
    the above specified marks; but when crossed, and their mongrels
    recrossed, young birds were often produced, more or less plainly
    coloured slaty-blue, with some or all of the proper characteristic
    marks. I may recall to the reader's memory one case, namely, that
    of a pigeon, hardly distinguishable from the wild Shetland species,
    the grandchild of a red-spot, white fantail, and two black barbs,
    from any of which, when purely-bred, the production of a pigeon
    coloured like the wild <I>C. livia</I> would have been almost a
    prodigy.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I was thus led to make the experiments,
    recorded in the seventh chapter, on fowls. I selected
    long-established pure breeds, in which there was not a trace of
    red, yet in several of the mongrels feathers of this colour
    appeared; and one magnificent bird, the offspring of a black
    Spanish cock and white Silk hen, was coloured almost exactly like
    the wild <I>Gallus bankiva.</I> All who know anything of the
    breeding of poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure
    Spanish and of pure white Silk fowls might have been reared without
    the appearance of a red feather. The fact, given on the authority
    of Mr. Tegetmeier, of the frequent appearance, in mongrel fowls, of
    pencilled or transversely-barred feathers, like those common to
    many gallinaceous birds, is likewise apparently a case of reversion
    to a character formerly possessed by some ancient progenitor of the
    family. I owe to the kindness of this excellent observer the
    opportunity of inspecting some neck-hackles and tail-feathers from
    a hybrid between the common fowl and a very distinct species, the
    Gallus varius; and these feathers are transversely striped in a
    conspicuous manner with dark metallic blue and grey, a character
    which could not have been derived from either immediate
    parent.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have been informed by Mr. B. P. Brent,
    that he crossed a white Aylesbury drake and a black so-called
    Labrador duck, both of which are true breeds, and he obtained a
    young drake closely like the mallard (<I>A. boschas</I>). Of the
    musk-duck (<I>Cairina moschata,</I> Linn.) there are two
    sub-breeds, namely, white and slate-coloured; and these I am
    informed breed true, or nearly true. But the Rev. W. D. Fox tells
    me that, by putting a white drake to a slate-coloured duck, black
    birds, pied with white, like the wild musk-duck, were always
    produced. I hear from Mr. Blyth that hybrids from the canary and
    gold-finch almost always have streaked feathers on their backs; and
    this streaking must be derived from the original wild
    canary.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We have seen in the fourth chapter, that
    the so-called Himalayan rabbit, with its snow-white body, black
    ears, nose, tail, and feet, breeds perfectly true. This race is
    known to have been formed by the union of two varieties of
    silver-grey rabbits. Now, when a Himalayan doe was crossed by a
    sandy-coloured buck, a silver-grey rabbit was produced; and this is
    evidently a case of reversion to one of the parent varieties. The
    young of the Himalayan rabbit are born snow-white, and the dark
    marks do not appear until some time subsequently; but occasionally
    young Himalayan rabbits are born of a light silver-grey, which
    colour soon disappears; so that here we have a trace of reversion,
    during an early period of life, to the parent varieties,
    independently of any recent cross.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the third chapter it was shown that at
    an ancient period some breeds of cattle in the wilder parts of
    Britain were white with dark ears, and that the cattle now kept
    half wild in certain parks, and those which have run quite wild in
    two distant parts of the world, are likewise thus coloured. Now, an
    experienced breeder, Mr. J. Beasley, of Northamptonshire,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> crossed some carefully selected West
    Highland cows with purely-bred shorthorn bulls. The bulls were red,
    red and white, or dark roan; and the Highland cows were all of a
    red colour, inclining to a light or yellow shade. But a
    considerable number of the offspring&#8212;and Mr. Beasley calls
    attention to this as a remarkable fact&#8212;were white, or white
    with red ears. Bearing in mind that none of the parents were white,
    and that they were purely-bred animals, it is highly probable that
    here the offspring reverted, in consequence of the cross, to the
    colour of some ancient and half-wild parent-breed. The following
    case, perhaps, comes under the same head: cows in their natural
    state have their udders but little developed, and do not yield
    nearly so much milk as our domesticated animals. Now there is some
    reason to believe<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> that cross-bred
    animals between two kinds, both of which are good milkers, such as
    Alderneys and Shorthorns, often turn out worthless in this
    respect.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the chapter on the Horse reasons were
    assigned for believing that the primitive stock was striped and
    dun-coloured; and details were given, showing that in all parts of
    the world stripes of a dark colour frequently appear along the
    spine, across the legs, and on the shoulders, where they are
    occasionally double or treble, and even sometimes on the face and
    body of horses of all breeds and of all colours. But the stripes
    appear most frequently on the various kinds of duns. In foals they
    are sometimes plainly seen, and subsequently disappear. The
    dun-colour and the stripes are strongly transmitted when a horse
    thus characterised is crossed with any other; but I was not able to
    prove that striped duns are generally produced from the crossing of
    two distinct breeds, neither of which are duns, though this does
    sometimes occur.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The legs of the ass are often striped,
    and this may be considered as a reversion to the wild parent form,
    the <I>Equus t&#230;niopus</I> of Abyssinia,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> which is generally thus striped. In the
    domestic animal the stripes on the shoulder are occasionally
    double, or forked at the extremity, as in certain zebrine species.
    There is reason to believe that the foal is more frequently striped
    on the legs than the adult animal. As with the horse, I have not
    acquired any distinct evidence that the crossing of
    differently-coloured varieties of the ass brings out the
    stripes.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>But now let us turn to the result of
    crossing the horse and ass. Although mules are not nearly so
    numerous in England as asses, I have seen a much greater number
    with striped legs, and with the stripes far more conspicuous than
    in either parent-form. Such mules are generally light-coloured, and
    might be called fallow-duns. The shoulder-stripe in one instance
    was deeply forked at the extremity, and in another instance was
    double, though united in the middle. Mr. Martin gives a figure of a
    Spanish mule with strong zebra-like marks on its legs,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> and remarks that mules are particularly
    liable to be thus striped on their legs. In South America,
    according to Roulin,<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> such stripes
    are more frequent and conspicuous in the mule than in the ass. In
    the United States, Mr. Gosse,<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
    speaking of these animals, says, "that in a great number, perhaps
    in nine out of every ten, the legs are banded with transverse dark
    stripes."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Many years ago I saw in the Zoological
    Gardens a curious triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from
    a male ass and female zebra. This animal when old had hardly any
    stripes; but I was assured by the superintendent, that when young
    it had shoulder-stripes, and faint stripes on its flanks and legs.
    I mention this case more especially as an instance of the stripes
    being much plainer during youth than in old age.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As the zebra has such a conspicuously
    striped body and legs, it might have been expected that the hybrids
    from this animal and the common ass would have had their legs in
    some degree striped; but it appears from the figures given in Dr.
    Gray's 'Knowsley Gleanings' and still more plainly from that given
    by Geoffroy and F. Cuvier,<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> that
    the legs are much more conspicuously striped than the rest of the
    body; and this fact is intelligible only on the belief that the ass
    aids in giving, through the power of reversion, this character to
    its hybrid offspring.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The quagga is banded over the whole front
    part of its body like a zebra, but has no stripes on its legs, or
    mere traces of them. But in the famous hybrid bred by Lord Morton<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> from a chestnut, nearly
    purely-bred, Arabian mare, by a male quagga, the stripes were "more
    strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of "the quagga."
    The mare was subsequently put to a black Arabian horse, and bore
    two colts, both of which, as formerly stated, were plainly striped
    on the legs, and one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and
    body.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The <I>Equus indicus</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> is characterised by a spinal stripe,
    without shoulder or leg stripes; but traces of these latter stripes
    may occasionally be seen even in the adult<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> and Colonel S. Poole, who has had ample
    opportunities for observation, informs me that in the foal, when
    first born, the head and legs are often striped, but the
    shoulder-stripe is not so distinct as in the domestic ass; all
    these stripes, excepting that along the spine, soon disappear. Now
    a hybrid, raised at Knowsley<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> from
    a female of this species by a male domestic ass, had all four legs
    transversely and conspicuously striped, had three short stripes on
    each shoulder and had even some zebra-like stripes on its face! Dr.
    Gray informs me that he has seen a second hybrid of the same
    parentage, similarly striped.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From these facts we see that the crossing
    of the several equine species tends in a marked manner to cause
    stripes to appear on various parts of the body, especially on the
    legs. As we do not know whether the parent-form of the genus was
    striped, the appearance of the stripes can only hypothetically be
    attributed to reversion. But most persons, after considering the
    many undoubted cases of variously coloured marks reappearing by
    reversion in my experiments on crossed pigeons and fowls, will come
    to the same conclusion with respect to the horse-genus; and if so,
    we must admit that the progenitor of the group was striped on the
    legs, shoulders, face, and probably over the whole body, like a
    zebra.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Lastly, Professor Jaeger has given<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> a good case with pigs. He crossed
    the Japanese or masked breed with the common German breed, and the
    offspring were intermediate in character. He then re-crossed one of
    these mongrels with the pure Japanese, and in the litter thus
    produced one of the young resembled in all its characters a wild
    pig; it had a long snout and upright ears, and was striped on the
    back. It should be borne in mind that the young of the Japanese
    breed are not striped, and that they have a short muzzle and ears
    remarkably dependent.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A similar tendency to the recovery of long lost
    characters holds good even with the instincts of crossed animals.
    There are some breeds of fowls which are called "everlasting
    layers," because they have lost the instinct of incubation; and so
    rare is it for them to incubate that I have seen notices published
    in works on poultry, when hens of such breeds have taken to sit.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> Yet the aboriginal species was of
    course a good incubator; and with birds in a state of nature hardly
    any instinct is so strong as this. Now, so many cases have been
    recorded of the crossed offspring from two races, neither of which
    are incubators, becoming first-rate sitters, that the reappearance
    of this instinct must be attributed to reversion from crossing. One
    author goes so far as to say, "that a cross between two non-sitting
    varieties almost invariably produces a mongrel that becomes broody,
    and sits with remarkable steadiness."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Another author, after giving a striking
    example, remarks that the fact can be explained only on the
    principle that "two negatives make a positive." It cannot, however,
    be maintained that hens produced from a cross between two
    non-sitting breeds invariably recover their lost instinct, any more
    than that crossed fowls or pigeons invariably recover the red or
    blue plumage of their prototypes. Thus I raised several chickens
    from a Polish hen by a Spanish cock,&#8212;breeds which do not
    incubate,&#8212;and none of the young hens at first showed any
    tendency to sit; but one of them&#8212;the only one which was
    preserved&#8212;in the third year sat well on her eggs and reared a
    brood of chickens. So that here we have the reappearance with
    advancing age of a primitive instinct, in the same manner as we
    have seen that the red plumage of the <I>Gallus bankiva</I> is
    sometimes reacquired both by crossed and purely-bred fowls of
    various kinds as they grow old.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The parents of all our domesticated animals were
    of course aboriginally wild in disposition; and when a domesticated
    species is crossed with a distinct species, whether this is a
    domesticated or only a tamed animal, the hybrids are often wild to
    such a degree, that the fact is intelligible only on the principle
    that the cross has caused a partial return to a primitive
    disposition. Thus, the Earl of Powis formerly imported some
    thoroughly domesticated humped cattle from India, and crossed them
    with English breeds, which belong to a distinct species; and his
    agent remarked to me, without any question having been asked, how
    oddly wild the cross-bred animals were. The European wild boar and
    the Chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly specifically
    distinct: Sir F. Darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a
    wild Alpine boar which had become extremely tame, but the young,
    though having half-domesticated blood in their veins, were
    "extremely wild in confinement, and would not eat swill like common
    English pigs." Captain Hutton, in India, crossed a tame goat with a
    wild one from the Himalaya, and he remarked to me how surprisingly
    wild the offspring were. Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience
    in crossing tame cock-pheasants with fowls belonging to five
    breeds, gives as the character of all "extraordinary wildness";<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> but I have myself seen one
    exception to this rule. Mr. S. J. Salter<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> who raised a large number of hybrids
    from a bantam-hen by <I>Gallus sonneratii,</I> states that "all
    were exceedingly wild." Mr. Waterton<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> bred some wild ducks from eggs hatched
    under a common duck, and the young were allowed to cross freely
    both amongst themselves and with the tame ducks; they were "half
    wild and half tame; they came to the windows to be fed, but still
    they had a wariness about them quite remarkable."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, mules from the horse and ass
    are certainly not in the least wild, though notorious for obstinacy
    and vice. Mr. Brent, who has crossed canary-birds with many kinds
    of finches, has not observed, as he informs me, that the hybrids
    were in any way remarkably wild: but Mr. Jenner Weir who has had
    still greater experience, is of a directly opposite opinion. He
    remarks that the siskin is the tamest of finches, but its mules are
    as wild, when young, as newly caught birds, and are often lost
    through their continued efforts to escape. Hybrids are often raised
    between the common and musk duck, and I have been assured by three
    persons, who have kept these crossed birds, that they were not
    wild; but Mr. Garnett<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> observed
    that his hybrids were wild, and exhibited "migratory propensities"
    of which there is not a vestige in the common or musk duck. No case
    is known of this latter bird having escaped and become wild in
    Europe or Asia, except, according to Pallas, on the Caspian Sea;
    and the common domestic duck only occasionally becomes wild in
    districts where large lakes and fens abound. Nevertheless, a large
    number of cases have been recorded<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> of hybrids from these two ducks having
    been shot in a completely wild state, although so few are reared in
    comparison with purely-bred birds of either species. It is
    improbable that any of these hybrids could have acquired their
    wildness from the musk-duck having paired with a truly wild duck;
    and this is known not to be the case in North America; hence we
    must infer that they have reacquired, through reversion, their
    wildness, as well as renewed powers of flight.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These latter facts remind us of the statements,
    so frequently made by travellers in all parts of the world, on the
    degraded state and savage disposition of crossed races of man. That
    many excellent and kind-hearted mulattos have existed no one will
    dispute; and a more mild and gentle set of men could hardly be
    found than the inhabitants of the island of Chiloe, who consist of
    Indians commingled with Spaniards in various proportions. On the
    other hand, many years ago, long before I had thought of the
    present subject, I was struck with the fact that, in South America,
    men of complicated descent between Negroes, Indians, and Spaniards,
    seldom had, whatever the cause might be, a good expression.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> Livingstone&#8212;and a more
    unimpeachable authority cannot be quoted,&#8212;after speaking of a
    half-caste man on the Zambesi, described by the Portuguese as a
    rare monster of inhumanity, remarks, "It is unaccountable why
    half-castes, such as he, are so much more cruel than the
    Portuguese, but such is undoubtedly the case." An inhabitant
    remarked to Livingstone, "God made white men, and God made black
    men, but the Devil made halfcastes."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> When two races, both low in the scale,
    are crossed the progeny seems to be eminently bad. Thus the
    noble-hearted Humboldt, who felt no prejudice against the inferior
    races, speaks in strong terms of the bad and savage disposition of
    Zambos, or half-castes between Indians and Negroes; and this
    conclusion has been arrived at by various observers.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> From these facts we may perhaps infer
    that the degraded state of so many half-castes is in part due to
    reversion to a primitive and savage condition, induced by the act
    of crossing, even if mainly due to the unfavourable moral
    conditions under which they are generally reared.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Summary on the proximate causes leading to
    Reversion.</I>&#8212;When purely-bred animals or plants reassume
    long-lost characters,&#8212;when the common ass, for instance, is
    born with striped legs, when a pure race of black or white pigeons
    throws a slaty-blue bird, or when a cultivated heartsease with
    large and rounded flowers produces a seedling with small and
    elongated flowers,&#8212;we are quite unable to assign any
    proximate cause. When animals run wild, the tendency to reversion,
    which, though it has been greatly exaggerated, no doubt exists, is
    sometimes to a certain extent intelligible. Thus, with feral pigs,
    exposure to the weather will probably favour the growth of the
    bristles, as is known to be the case with the hair of other
    domesticated animals, and through correlation the tusks will tend
    to be redeveloped. But the reappearance of coloured longitudinal
    stripes on young feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct
    action of external conditions. In this case, and in many others, we
    can only say that any change in the habits of life apparently
    favour a tendency, inherent or latent in the species, to return to
    the primitive state.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It will be shown in a future chapter that the
    position of flowers on the summit of the axis, and the position of
    seeds within the capsule, sometimes determine a tendency towards
    reversion; and this apparently depends on the amount of sap or
    nutriment which the flower-buds and seeds receive. The position,
    also, of buds, either on branches or on roots, sometimes
    determines, as was formerly shown, the transmission of the
    character proper to the variety, or its reversion to a former
    state.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have seen in the last section that when two
    races or species are crossed there is the strongest tendency to the
    reappearance in the offspring of long-lost characters, possessed by
    neither parent nor immediate progenitor. When two white, or red, or
    black pigeons, of well-established breeds, are united, the
    offspring are almost sure to inherit the same colours; but when
    differently-coloured birds are crossed, the opposed forces of
    inheritance apparently counteract each other, and the tendency
    which is inherent in both parents to produce slaty-blue offspring
    becomes predominant. So it is in several other cases. But when, for
    instance, the ass is crossed with <I>E. indicus</I> or with the
    horse&#8212;animals which have not striped legs&#8212;and the
    hybrids have conspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their
    faces, all that can be said is, that an inherent tendency to
    reversion is evolved through some disturbance in the organisation
    caused by the act of crossing.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Another form of reversion is far commoner,
    indeed is almost universal with the offspring from a cross, namely,
    to the characters proper to either pure parent-form. As a general
    rule, crossed offspring in the first generation are nearly
    intermediate between their parents, but the grandchildren and
    succeeding generations continually revert, in a greater or lesser
    degree, to one or both of their progenitors. Several authors have
    maintained that hybrids and mongrels include all the characters of
    both parents, not fused together, but merely mingled in different
    proportions in different parts of the body; or, as Naudin<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> has expressed it, a hybrid is a living
    mosaic-work, in which the eye cannot distinguish the discordant
    elements, so completely are they intermingled. We can hardly doubt
    that, in a certain sense, this is true, as when we behold in a
    hybrid the elements of both species segregating themselves into
    segments in the same flower or fruit, by a process of
    self-attraction or self-affinity; this segregation taking place
    either by seminal or bud-propagation. Naudin further believes that
    the segregation of the two specific elements or essences is
    eminently liable to occur in the male and female reproductive
    matter; and he thus explains the almost universal tendency to
    reversion in successive hybrid generations. For this would be the
    natural result of the union of pollen and ovules, in both of which
    the elements of the same species had been segregated by
    self-affinity. If, on the other hand, pollen which included the
    elements of one species happened to unite with ovules including the
    elements of the other species, the intermediate or hybrid state
    would still be retained, and there would be no reversion. But it
    would, as I suspect, be more correct to say that the elements of
    both parent-species exist in every hybrid in a double state,
    namely, blended together and completely separate. How this is
    possible, and what the term specific essence or element may be
    supposed to express, I shall attempt to show in the chapter on the
    hypothesis of pangenesis.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But Naudin's view, as propounded by him, is not
    applicable to the reappearance of characters lost long ago by
    variation; and it is hardly applicable to races or species which,
    after having been crossed at some former period with a distinct
    form, and having since lost all traces of the cross, nevertheless
    occasionally yield an individual which reverts (as in the case of
    the great-great-grandchild of the pointer Sappho) to the crossing
    form. The most simple case of reversion, namely, of a hybrid or
    mongrel to its grandparents, is connected by an almost perfect
    series with the extreme case of a purely-bred race recovering
    characters which had been lost during many ages; and we are thus
    led to infer that all the cases must be related by some common
    bond.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">G&#228;rtner believed that only highly sterile
    hybrid plants exhibit any tendency to reversion to their
    parent-forms. This erroneous belief may perhaps be accounted for by
    the nature of the genera crossed by him, for he admits that the
    tendency differs in different genera. The statement is also
    directly contradicted by Naudin's observations, and by the
    notorious fact that perfectly fertile mongrels exhibit the tendency
    in a high degree,&#8212;even in a higher degree, according to
    G&#228;rtner himself, than hybrids.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">G&#228;rtner further states that reversions
    rarely occur with hybrid plants raised from species which have not
    been cultivated, whilst, with those which have been long
    cultivated, they are of frequent occurrence. This conclusion
    explains a curious discrepancy: Max Wichura<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> who worked exclusively on willows which
    had not been subjected to culture, never saw an instance of
    reversion; and he goes so far as to suspect that the careful
    Gartner had not sufficiently protected his hybrids from the pollen
    of the parent-species: Naudin, on the other hand, who chiefly
    experimented on cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants, insists
    more strenuously than any other author on the tendency to reversion
    in all hybrids. The conclusion that the condition of the
    parent-species, as affected by culture, is one of the proximate
    causes leading to reversion, agrees well with the converse case of
    domesticated animals and cultivated plants being liable to
    reversion when they become feral; for in both cases the
    organisation or constitution must be disturbed, though in a very
    different way.<A href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, we have seen that characters often
    reappear in purely-bred races without our being able to assign any
    proximate cause; but when they become feral this is either
    indirectly or directly induced by the change in their conditions of
    life. With crossed breeds, the act of crossing in itself certainly
    leads to the recovery of long-lost characters, as well as of those
    derived from either parent-form. Changed conditions, consequent on
    cultivation, and the relative position of buds, flowers, and seeds
    on the plant, all apparently aid in giving this same tendency.
    Reversion may occur either through seminal or bud generation,
    generally at birth, but sometimes only with an advance of age.
    Segments or portions of the individual may alone be thus affected.
    That a being should be born resembling in certain characters an
    ancestor removed by two or three, and in some cases by hundreds or
    even thousands of generations, is assuredly a wonderful fact. In
    these cases the child is commonly said to inherit such characters
    directly from its grandparent, or more remote ancestors. But this
    view is hardly conceivable. If, however, we suppose that every
    character is derived exclusively from the father or mother, but
    that many characters lie latent or dormant in both parents during a
    long succession of generations, the foregoing facts are
    intelligible. In what manner characters may be conceived to lie
    latent, will be considered in a future chapter to which I have
    lately alluded.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Latent Characters.</I>&#8212;But I must
    explain what is meant by characters lying latent. The most obvious
    illustration is afforded by secondary sexual characters. In every
    female all the secondary male characters, and in every male all the
    secondary female characters, apparently exist in a latent state,
    ready to be evolved under certain conditions. It is well known that
    a large number of female birds, such as fowls, various pheasants,
    partridges, peahens, ducks, etc., when old or diseased, or when
    operated on, assume many or all of the secondary male characters of
    their species. In the case of the hen-pheasant this has been
    observed to occur far more frequently during certain years than
    during others.<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> A duck ten years
    old has been known to assume both the perfect winter and summer
    plumage of the drake.<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> Waterton,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> gives a curious case of a hen which
    had ceased laying, and had assumed the plumage, voice, spurs, and
    warlike disposition of the cock; when opposed to an enemy she would
    erect her hackles and show fight. Thus every character, even to the
    instinct and manner of fighting, must have lain dormant in this hen
    as long as her ovaria continued to act. The females of two kinds of
    deer, when old, have been known to acquire horns; and, as Hunter
    has remarked, we see something of an analogous nature in the human
    species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, with male animals, it is
    notorious that the secondary sexual characters are more or less
    completely lost when they are subjected to castration. Thus, if the
    operation be performed on a young cock, he never, as Yarrell
    states, crows again; the comb, wattles, and spurs do not grow to
    their full size, and the hackles assume an intermediate appearance
    between true hackles and the feathers of the hen. Cases are
    recorded of confinement, which often affects the reproductive
    system, causing analogous results. But characters properly confined
    to the female are likewise acquired by the male; the capon takes to
    sitting on eggs, and will bring up chickens; and what is more
    curious, the utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the
    fowl act in the same manner, "their delight being to watch when the
    hens leave their nests, and to take on themselves the office of a
    sitter."<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> That admirable observer
    Reaumur<A href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> asserts that a cock, by
    being long confined in solitude and darkness, can be taught to take
    charge of young chickens; he then utters a peculiar cry, and
    retains during his whole life this newly acquired maternal
    instinct. The many well-ascertained cases of various male mammals
    giving milk shows that their rudimentary mammary glands retain this
    capacity in a latent condition.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We thus see that in many, probably in all cases,
    the secondary characters of each sex lie dormant or latent in the
    opposite sex, ready to be evolved under peculiar circumstances. We
    can thus understand how, for instance, it is possible for a good
    milking cow to transmit her good qualities through her male
    offspring to future generations; for we may confidently believe
    that these qualities are present, though latent, in the males of
    each generation. So it is with the game-cock, who can transmit his
    superiority in courage and vigour through his female to his male
    offspring; and with man it is known<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> that diseases, such as hydrocele,
    necessarily confined to the male sex, can be transmitted through
    the female to the grandson. Such cases as these offer, as was
    remarked at the commencement of this chapter, the simplest possible
    examples of reversion; and they are intelligible on the belief that
    characters common to the grandparent and grandchild of the same sex
    are present, though latent, in the intermediate parent of the
    opposite sex.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The subject of latent characters is so
    important, as we shall see in a future chapter, that I will give
    another illustration. Many animals have the right and left sides of
    their body unequally developed: this is well known to be the case
    with flat-fish, in which the one side differs in thickness and
    colour and in the shape of the fins, from the other, and during the
    growth of the young fish one eye is gradually twisted from the
    lower to the upper surface.<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> In
    most flat-fishes the left is the blind side, but in some it is the
    right; though in both cases reversed or "wrong fishes," are
    occasionally developed; and in <I>Platessa flesus</I> the right or
    left side is indifferently the upper one. With gasteropods or
    shell-fish, the right and left sides are extremely unlike; the far
    greater number of species are dextral, with rare and occasional
    reversals of development; and some few are normally sinistral; but
    certain species of Bulimus, and many Achatinell&#230;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> are as often sinistral as dextral. I
    will give an analogous case in the great articulate kingdom: the
    two sides of Verruca<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> are so
    wonderfully unlike, that without careful dissection it is extremely
    difficult to recognise the corresponding parts on the opposite
    sides of the body; yet it is apparently a mere matter of chance
    whether it be the right or the left side that undergoes so singular
    amount of change. One plant is known to me<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> in which the flower, according as it
    stands on the one or other side of the spike, is unequally
    developed. In all the foregoing cases the two sides are perfectly
    symmetrical at an early period of growth. Now, whenever a species
    is as liable to be unequally developed on the one as on the other
    side, we may infer that the capacity for such development is
    present, though latent, in the undeveloped side. And as a reversal
    of development occasionally occurs in animals of many kinds, this
    latent capacity is probably very common.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The best yet simplest cases of characters lying
    dormant are, perhaps, those previously given, in which chickens and
    young pigeons, raised from a cross between differently coloured
    birds, are at first of one colour, but in a year or two acquire
    feathers of the colour of the other parent; for in this case the
    tendency to a change of plumage is clearly latent in the young
    bird. So it is with hornless breeds of cattle, some of which
    acquire small horns as they grow old. Purely bred black and white
    bantams, and some other fowls, occasionally assume, with advancing
    years, the red feathers of the parent-species. I will here add a
    somewhat different case, as it connects in a striking manner latent
    characters of two classes. Mr. Hewitt<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> possessed an excellent Sebright
    gold-laced bantam hen, which, as she became old, grew diseased in
    her ovaria, and assumed male characters. In this breed the males
    resemble the females in all respects except in their combs,
    wattles, spurs, and instincts; hence it might have been expected
    that the diseased hen would have assumed only those masculine
    characters which are proper to the breed, but she acquired, in
    addition, well-arched tail sickle-feathers quite a foot in length,
    saddle-feathers on the loins, and hackles on the
    neck,&#8212;ornaments which, as Mr. Hewitt remarks, "would be held
    as abominable in this breed." The Sebright bantam is known<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> to have originated about the year 1800
    from a cross between a common bantam and a Polish fowl, recrossed
    by a hen-tailed bantam, and carefully selected; hence there can
    hardly be a doubt that the sickle-feathers and hackles which
    appeared in the old hen were derived from the Polish fowl or common
    bantam; and we thus see that not only certain masculine characters
    proper to the Sebright bantam, but other masculine characters
    derived from the first progenitors of the breed, removed by a
    period of above sixty years, were lying latent in this henbird,
    ready to be evolved as soon as her ovaria became diseased.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From these several facts it must be admitted
    that certain characters, capacities, and instincts, may lie latent
    in an individual, and even in a succession of individuals, without
    our being able to detect the least sign of their presence. When
    fowls, pigeons, or cattle of different colours are crossed, and
    their offspring change colour as they grow old, or when the crossed
    turbit acquired the characteristic frill after its third moult, or
    when rarely-bred bantams partially assume the red plumage of their
    prototype, we cannot doubt that these qualities were from the first
    present, though latent, in the individual animal, like the
    characters of a moth in the caterpillar. Now, if these animals had
    produced offspring before they had acquired with advancing age
    their new characters, nothing is more probable than that they would
    have transmitted them to some of their offspring, who in this case
    would in appearance have received such characters from their
    grand-parents or more distant progenitors. We should then have had
    a case of reversion, that is, of the reappearance in the child of
    an ancestral character, actually present, though during youth
    completely latent, in the parent; and this we may safely conclude
    is what occurs in all reversions to progenitors, however
    remote.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This view of the latency in each generation of
    all the characters which appear through reversion, is also
    supported by their actual presence in some cases during early youth
    alone, or by their more frequent appearance and greater
    distinctness at this age than during maturity. We have seen that
    this is often the case with the stripes on the legs and faces of
    the several species of the horse genus. The Himalayan rabbit, when
    crossed, sometimes produces offspring which revert to the parent
    silver-grey breed, and we have seen that in purely bred animals
    pale-grey fur occasionally reappears during early youth. Black
    cats, we may feel assured, would occasionally produce by reversion
    tabbies; and on young black kittens, with a pedigree<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> known to have been long pure, faint
    traces of stripes may almost always be seen which afterwards
    disappear. Hornless Suffolk cattle occasionally produce by
    reversion horned animals; and Youatt<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> asserts that even in hornless
    individuals "the rudiment of a horn may be often felt at an early
    age."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">No doubt it appears at first sight in the
    highest degree improbable that in every horse of every generation
    there should be a latent capacity and tendency to produce stripes,
    though these may not appear once in a thousand generations; that in
    every white, black, or other coloured pigeon, which may have
    transmitted its proper colour during centuries, there should be a
    latent capacity in the plumage to become blue and to be marked with
    certain characteristic bars; that in every child in a six-fingered
    family there should be the capacity for the production of an
    additional digit; and so in other cases. Nevertheless, there is no
    more inherent improbability in this being the case than in a
    useless and rudimentary organ, or even in only a tendency to the
    production of a rudimentary organ, being inherited during millions
    of generations, as is well known to occur with a multitude of
    organic beings. There is no more inherent improbability in each
    domestic pig, during a thousand generations, retaining the capacity
    and tendency to develop great tusks under fitting conditions, than
    in the young calf having retained, for an indefinite number of
    generations rudimentary incisor teeth, which never protrude through
    the gums.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I shall give at the end of the next chapter a
    summary of the three preceding chapters; but as isolated and
    striking cases of reversion have here been chiefly insisted on, I
    wish to guard the reader against supposing that reversion is due to
    some rare or accidental combination of circumstances. When a
    character, lost during hundreds of generations, suddenly reappears,
    no doubt some such combination must occur; but reversions, to the
    immediately preceding generations may be constantly observed, at
    least, in the offspring of most unions. This has been universally
    recognised in the case of hybrids and mongrels, but it has been
    recognised simply from the difference between the united forms
    rendering the resemblance of the offspring to their grandparents or
    more remote progenitors of easy detection. Reversion is likewise
    almost invariably the rule, as Mr. Sedgwick has shown, with certain
    diseases. Hence we must conclude that a tendency to this peculiar
    form of transmission is an integral part of the general law of
    inheritance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Monstrosities.</I>&#8212;A large number of
    monstrous growths and of lesser anomalies are admitted by every one
    to be due to an arrest of development, that is, to the persistence
    of an embryonic condition. But many monstrosities cannot be thus
    explained; for parts of which no trace can be detected in the
    embryo, but which occur in other members of the same class of
    animals occasionally appear, and these may probably with truth be
    attributed to reversion. As, however, I have treated this subject
    as fully as I could in my 'Descent of Man' (ch. 1 2nd edition), I
    will not here recur to it.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>When flowers which have normally an
    irregular structure become regular or peloric, the change is
    generally looked at by botanists as a return to the primitive
    state. But Dr. Maxwell Masters,<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
    who has ably discussed this subject, remarks that when, for
    instance, all the sepals of a Trop&#230;olum become green and of
    the same shape, instead of being coloured with one prolonged into a
    spur, or when all the petals of a Linaria become simple and
    regular, such cases may be due merely to an arrest of development;
    for in these flowers all the organs during their earliest condition
    are symmetrical, and, if arrested at this stage of growth, they
    would not become irregular. If, moreover, the arrest were to take
    place at a still earlier period of development, the result would be
    a simple tuft of green leaves; and no one probably would call this
    a case of reversion. Dr. Masters designates the cases first alluded
    to as regular peloria; and others, in which all the corresponding
    parts assume a similar form of irregularity, as when all the petals
    in a Linaria become spurred, as irregular peloria. We have no right
    to attribute these latter cases to reversion, until it can be shown
    that the parent-form, for instance, of the genus Linaria had had
    all its petals spurred; for a chance of this nature might result
    from the spreading of an anomalous structure, in accordance with
    the law, to be discussed in a future chapter, of homologous parts
    tending to vary in the same manner. But as both forms of peloria
    frequently occur on the same individual plant of the Linaria,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> they probably stand in some close
    relation to one another. On the doctrine that peloria is simply the
    result of an arrest of development, it is difficult to understand
    how an organ arrested at a very early period of growth should
    acquire its full functional perfection;&#8212;how a petal, supposed
    to be thus arrested, should acquire its brilliant colours, and
    serve as an envelope to the flower, or a stamen produce efficient
    pollen; yet this occurs with many peloric flowers. That pelorism is
    not due to mere chance variability, but either to an arrest of
    development or to reversion, we may infer from an observation made
    by Ch. Morren<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> namely, that
    families which have irregular flowers often "return by these
    monstrous growths to their regular form; whilst we never see a
    regular flower realise the structure of an irregular
    one."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Some flowers have almost certainly become
    more or less completely peloric through reversion, as the following
    interesting case shows. <I>Corydalis tuberosa</I> properly has one
    of its two nectaries colourless, destitute of nectar, only half the
    size of the other, and therefore, to a certain extent, in a
    rudimentary state; the pistil is curved towards the perfect
    nectary, and the hood, formed of the inner petals, slips off the
    pistil and stamen in one direction alone, so that, when a bee sucks
    the perfect nectary, the stigma and stamens are exposed and rubbed
    against the insect's body. In several closely allied genera, as in
    Dielytra, etc., there are two perfect nectaries, the pistil is
    straight, and the hood slips off on either side, according as the
    bee sucks either nectary. Now, I have examined several flowers of
    <I>Corydalis tuberosa,</I> in which both nectaries were equally
    developed and contained nectar; in this we see only the
    redevelopment of a partially aborted organ; but with this
    redevelopment the pistil becomes straight, and the hood slips off
    in either direction, so that these flowers have acquired the
    perfect structure, so well adapted for insect agency, of Dielytra
    and its allies. We cannot attribute these coadapted modifications
    to chance, or to correlated variability; we must attribute them to
    reversion to a primordial condition of the species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The peloric flowers of Pelargonium have
    their five petals in all respects alike, and there is no nectary so
    that they resemble the symmetrical flowers of the closely allied
    genus Geranium; but the alternate stamens are also sometimes
    destitute of anthers, the shortened filaments being left as
    rudiments, and in this respect they resemble the symmetrical
    flowers of the closely allied genus Erodium. Hence we may look at
    the peloric flowers of Pelargonium as having reverted to the state
    of some primordial form, the progenitor of the three closely
    related genera of Pelargonium, Geranium, and Erodium.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the peloric form of <I>Antirrhinum
    majus,</I> appropriately called the "<I>Wonder,</I>" the tubular
    and elongated flowers differ wonderfully from those of the common
    snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the corolla consist of six
    equal lobes, and include six equal instead of four unequal stamens.
    One of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed by the
    development of a microscopically minute papilla, which may be found
    at the base of the upper lip of the flower of the common
    snapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by me. That this
    papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various
    degrees of development in crossed plants between the common and the
    peloric Antirrhinum. Again, a peloric <I>Galeobdolon luteum,</I>
    growing in my garden, had five equal petals, all striped like the
    ordinary lower lip, and included five equal instead of four unequal
    stamens; but Mr. R. Keeley, who sent me this plant, informs me that
    the flowers vary greatly, having from four to six lobes to the
    corolla, and from three to six stamens.<A href=

    families to which the Antirrhinum and Galeobdolon belong are
    properly pentamerous, with some of the parts confluent and others
    suppressed, we ought not to look at the sixth stamen and the sixth
    lobe to the corolla in either case as due to reversion, any more
    than the additional petals in double flowers in these same two
    families. But the case is different with the fifth stamen in the
    peloric Antirrhinum, which is produced by the redevelopment of a
    rudiment always present, and which probably reveals to us the state
    of the flower, as far as the stamens are concerned, at some ancient
    epoch. It is also difficult to believe that the other four stamens
    and the petals, after an arrest of development at a very early
    embryonic age, would have come to full perfection in colour,
    structure, and function, unless these organs had at some former
    period normally passed through a similar course of growth. Hence it
    appears to me probable that the progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum
    must at some remote epoch have included five stamens and borne
    flowers in some degree resembling those now produced by the peloric
    form. The conclusion that peloria is not a mere monstrosity,
    irrespective of any former state of the species, is supported by
    the fact that this structure is often strongly inherited, as in the
    case of the peloric Antirrhinum and Gloxinia and sometimes in that
    of the peloric <I>Corydalis solida.</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Lastly I may add that many instances have
    been recorded of flowers, not generally considered as peloric, in
    which certain organs are abnormally augmented in number. As an
    increase of parts cannot be looked at as an arrest of development,
    nor as due to the redevelopment of rudiments, for no rudiments are
    present, and as these additional parts bring the plant into closer
    relationship with its natural allies, they ought probably to be
    viewed as reversions to a primordial condition.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These several facts show us in an interesting
    manner how intimately certain abnormal states are connected
    together; namely, arrests of development causing parts to become
    rudimentary or to be wholly suppressed,&#8212;the redevelopment of
    parts now in a more or less rudimentary condition,&#8212;the
    reappearance of organs of which not a vestige can be
    detected,&#8212;and to these may be added, in the case of animals,
    the presence during youth, and subsequent disappearance, of certain
    characters which occasionally are retained throughout life. Some
    naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to the
    ideal state of the group to which the affected being belongs; but
    it is difficult to conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this
    expression. Other naturalists maintain, with greater probability
    and distinctness of view, that the common bond of connection
    between the several foregoing cases is an actual, though partial,
    return to the structure of the ancient progenitor of the group. If
    this view be correct, we must believe that a vast number of
    characters, capable of evolution, lie hidden in every organic
    being. But it would be a mistake to suppose that the number is
    equally great in all beings. We know, for instance, that plants of
    many orders occasionally become peloric; but many more cases have
    been observed in the Labiat&#230; and Scrophulariace&#230; than in
    any other order; and in one genus of the Scrophulariace&#230;,
    namely Linaria, no less than thirteen species have been described
    in this condition.<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> On this view
    of the nature of peloric flowers, and bearing in mind certain
    monstrosities in the animal kingdom, we must conclude that the
    progenitors of most plants and animals have left an impression,
    capable of redevelopment, on the germs of their descendants,
    although these have since been profoundly modified.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The fertilised germ of one of the higher
    animals, subjected as it is to so vast a series of changes from the
    germinal cell to old age,&#8212;incessantly agitated by what
    Quatrefages well calls the <I>tourbillon vital,</I>&#8212;is
    perhaps the most wonderful object in nature. It is probable that
    hardly a change of any kind affects either parent, without some
    mark being left on the germ. But on the doctrine of reversion, as
    given in this chapter, the germ becomes a far more marvellous
    object, for, besides the visible changes which it undergoes, we
    must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters, proper
    to both sexes, to both the right and left side of the body, and to
    a long line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or
    even thousands of generations from the present time: and these
    characters, like those written on paper with invisible ink, lie
    ready to be evolved whenever the organisation is disturbed by
    certain known or unknown conditions.</P>

      cock and Silver-pencilled Hamburgh hen, neither of which are

      broods "showed a perfect obstinacy in sitting." The Rev. E. S.
      Dixon ('Ornamental Poultry,' 1848, p. 200) says that chickens
      reared from a cross between Golden and Black Polish fowls, are
      "good and steady birds to sit." Mr. B. P. Brent informs me that
      he raised some good sitting hens by crossing Pencilled Hamburgh
