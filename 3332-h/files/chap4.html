    <P align="JUSTIFY">All naturalists, with, as far as I know, a
    single exception, believe that the several domestic breeds of the
    rabbit are descended from the common wild species; I shall
    therefore describe them more carefully than in the previous cases.
    Professor Gervais<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> states "that the
    true wild rabbit is smaller than the domestic; its proportions are
    not absolutely the same; its tail is smaller; its ears are shorter
    and more thickly clothed with hair; and these characters, without
    speaking of colour, are so many indications opposed to the opinion
    which unites these animals under the same specific denomination."
    Few naturalists will agree with this author that such slight
    differences are sufficient to separate as distinct species the wild
    and domestic rabbit. How extraordinary it would be, if close
    confinement, perfect tameness, unnatural food, and careful
    breeding, all prolonged during many generations, had not produced
    at least some effect! The tame rabbit has been domesticated from an
    ancient period. Confucius ranges rabbits among animals worthy to be
    sacrificed to the gods, and, as he prescribes their multiplication,
    they were probably at this early period domesticated in China. They
    are mentioned by several of the classical writers. In 1631 Gervaise
    Markham writes, "You shall not, as in other cattell, looke to their
    shape, but to their richnesse, onely elect your buckes, the largest
    and goodliest conies you can get; and for the richnesse of the
    skin, that is accounted the richest which hath the equallest
    mixture of blacke and white haire together, yet the blacke rather
    shadowing the white; the furre should be thicke, deepe, smooth, and
    shining; ... they are of body much fatter and larger, and, when
    another skin is worth two or three pence, they are worth two
    shillings." From this full description we see that silver-grey
    rabbits existed in England at this period; and what is far more
    important, we see that the breeding or selection of rabbits was
    then carefully attended to. Aldrovandi, in 1637, describes, on the
    authority of several old writers (as Scaliger, in 1557), rabbits of
    various colours, some "like a hare," and he adds that P. Valerianus
    (who died a very old man in 1558) saw at Verona rabbits four times
    bigger than ours.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the fact of the rabbit having been
    domesticated at an ancient period, we must look to the northern
    hemisphere of the Old World, and to the warmer temperate regions
    alone, for the aboriginal parent-form; for the rabbit cannot live
    without protection in countries as cold as Sweden, and, though it
    has run wild in the tropical island of Jamaica, it has never
    greatly multiplied there. It now exists, and has long existed, in
    the warmer temperate parts of Europe, for fossil remains have been
    found in several countries.<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> The
    domestic rabbit readily becomes feral in these same countries, and
    when variously coloured kinds are turned out they generally revert
    to the ordinary grey colour.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Wild
    rabbits, if taken young, can be domesticated, though the process is
    generally very troublesome.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> The
    various domestic races are often crossed, and are believed to be
    quite fertile together, and a perfect gradation can be shown to
    exist from the largest domestic kinds, having enormously developed
    ears, to the common wild kind. The parent-form must have been a
    burrowing animal, a habit not common, as far as I can discover, to
    any other species in the large genus Lepus. Only one wild species
    is known with certainty to exist in Europe; but the rabbit (if it
    be a true rabbit) from Mount Sinai, and likewise that from Algeria,
    present slight differences; and these forms have been considered by
    some authors as specifically distinct.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> But such slight differences would aid us
    little in explaining the more considerable differences
    characteristic of the several domestic races. If the latter are the
    descendants of two or more closely allied species, these, with the
    exception of the common rabbit, have been exterminated in a wild
    state; and this is very improbable, seeing with what pertinacity
    this animal holds its ground. From these several reasons we may
    infer with safety that all the domestic breeds are the descendants
    of the common wild species. But from what we hear of the marvellous
    success in France in rearing hybrids between the hare and rabbit,
    it is possible, though not probable, from the great difficulty in
    making the first cross, that some of the larger races, which are
    coloured like the hare, may have been modified by crosses with this
    animal. Nevertheless, the chief differences in the skeletons of the
    several domestic breeds cannot, as we shall presently see, have
    been derived from a cross with the hare.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There are many breeds which transmit their
    characters more or less truly. Every one has seen the enormous
    lop-eared rabbits exhibited at our shows; various allied sub-breeds
    are reared on the Continent, such as the so-called Andalusian,
    which is said to have a large head with a round forehead, and to
    attain a greater size than any other kind; another large Paris
    breed is named the Rouennais, and has a square head; the so-called
    Patagonian rabbit has remarkably short ears and a large round head.
    Although I have not seen all these breeds, I feel some doubt about
    there being any marked difference in the shape of their skulls.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> English lop-eared rabbits often
    weigh 8 pounds or 10 pounds, and one has been exhibited weighing 18
    pounds; whereas a full-sized wild rabbit weighs only about 3-1/4
    pounds. The head or skull in all the large lop-eared rabbits
    examined by me is much longer relatively to its breadth than in the
    wild rabbit. Many of them have loose transverse folds of skin or
    dewlaps beneath the throat, which can be pulled out so as to reach
    nearly to the ends of the jaws. Their ears are prodigiously
    developed, and hang down on each side of their faces. A rabbit was
    exhibited in 1867 with its two ears, measured from the tip of one
    to the tip of the other, 22 inches in length, and each ear 5-3/8
    inches in breadth. In 1869 one was exhibited with ears, measured in
    the same manner, 23-1/8 in length and 5-1/2 in breadth; "thus
    exceeding any rabbit ever exhibited at a prize show." In a common
    wild rabbit I found that the length of two ears, from tip to tip,
    was 7-5/8 inches, and the breadth only 1-7/8 inch. The weight of
    body in the larger rabbits, and the development of their ears, are
    the qualities which win prizes, and have been carefully
    selected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The hare-coloured, or, as it is sometimes
    called, the Belgian rabbit, differs in nothing except colour from
    the other large breeds; but Mr. J. Young, of Southampton, a great
    breeder of this kind, informs me that the females, in all the
    specimens examined by him, had only six mamm&#230; and this
    certainly was the case with two females which came into my
    possession. Mr. B. P. Brent, however, assures me that the number is
    variable with other domestic rabbits. The common wild rabbit always
    has ten mamm&#230;. The Angora rabbit is remarkable from the length
    and fineness of its fur, which even on the soles of the feet is of
    considerable length. This breed is the only one which differs in
    its mental qualities, for it is said to be much more sociable than
    other rabbits, and the male shows no wish to destroy its young.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Two live rabbits were brought to me
    from Moscow, of about the size of the wild species, but with long
    soft fur, different from that of the Angora. These Moscow rabbits
    had pink eyes and were snow-white, excepting the ears, two spots
    near the nose, the upper and under surface of the tail, and the
    hinder tarsi, which were blackish-brown. In short, they were
    coloured nearly like the so-called Himalayan rabbits, presently to
    be described, and differed from them only in the character of their
    fur. There are two other breeds which come true to colour, but
    differ in no other respect, namely silver-greys and chinchillas.
    Lastly, the Nicard or Dutch rabbit may be mentioned, which varies
    in colour, and is remarkable from its small size, some specimens
    weighing only 1-1/4 pounds; rabbits of this breed make excellent
    nurses for other and more delicate kinds.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Certain characters are remarkably fluctuating,
    or are very feebly transmitted by domestic rabbits: thus, one
    breeder tells me that with the smaller kinds he has hardly ever
    raised a whole litter of the same colour: with the large lop-eared
    breeds "it is impossible," says a great judge,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> "to breed true to colour, but by
    judicious crossing a great deal may be done towards it. The fancier
    should know how his does are bred, that is, the colour of their
    parents." Nevertheless, certain colours, as we shall presently see,
    are transmitted truly. The dewlap is not strictly inherited.
    Lop-eared rabbits, with their ears hanging down flat on each side
    of the face, do not transmit this character at all truly. Mr.
    Delamer remarks that, "with fancy rabbits, when both the parents
    are perfectly formed, have model ears, and are handsomely marked,
    their progeny do not invariably turn out the same." When one
    parent, or even both, are oar-laps, that is, have their ears
    sticking out at right angles, or when one parent or both are
    half-lops, that is, have only one ear dependent, there is nearly as
    good a chance of the progeny having both ears full-lop, as if both
    parents had been thus characterised. But I am informed, if both
    parents have upright ears, there is hardly a chance of a full-lop.
    In some half-lops the ear that hangs down is broader and longer
    than the upright ear;<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> so that we
    have the unusual case of a want of symmetry on the two sides. This
    difference in the position and size of the two ears probably
    indicates that the lopping results from the great length and weight
    of the ear, favoured no doubt by the weakness of the muscles
    consequent on disuse. Anderson<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
    mentions a breed having only a single ear; and Professor Gervais
    another breed destitute of ears.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We come now to the Himalayan breed, which is
    sometimes called Chinese, Polish, or Russian. These pretty rabbits
    are white, or occasionally yellow, excepting their ears, nose,
    feet, and the upper side of the tail, which are all brownish-black;
    but as they have red eyes, they may be considered as albinoes. I
    have received several accounts of their breeding perfectly true.
    From their symmetrical marks, they were at first ranked as
    specifically distinct, and were provisionally named <I>L.
    nigripes.</I><A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> Some good observers
    thought that they could detect a difference in their habits, and
    stoutly maintained that they formed a new species. The origin of
    this breed is so curious, both in itself and as throwing some light
    on the complex laws of inheritance that it is worth giving in
    detail. But it is first necessary briefly to describe two other
    breeds: silver-greys or silver-sprigs generally have black heads
    and legs, and their fine grey fur is interspersed with numerous
    black and white long hairs. They breed perfectly true, and have
    long been kept in warrens. When they escape and cross with common
    rabbits, the product, as I hear from Mr. Wyrley Birch, of Wretham
    Hall, is not a mixture of the two colours, but about half take
    after the one parent, and the other half after the other parent.
    Secondly, chinchillas or tame silver-greys (I will use the former
    name) have short, paler, mouse or slate-coloured fur, interspersed
    with long, blackish, slate-coloured, and white hairs.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> These rabbits breed perfectly true. A
    writer stated in 1857<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> that he had
    produced Himalayan rabbits in the following manner. He had a breed
    of chinchillas which had been crossed with the common black rabbit,
    and their offspring were either blacks or chinchillas. These latter
    were again crossed with other chinchillas (which had also been
    crossed with silver-greys), and from this complicated cross
    Himalayan rabbits were raised. From these and other similar
    statements, Mr. Bartlett<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> was led
    to make a careful trial in the Zoological Gardens, and he found
    that by simply crossing silver-greys with chinchillas he could
    always produce some few Himalayans; and the latter, notwithstanding
    their sudden origin, if kept separate, bred perfectly true. But I
    have recently been assured the pure silver-greys of any sub-breed
    occasionally produce Himalayans.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The Himalayans, when first born, are quite
    white, and are then true albinoes; but in the course of a few
    months they gradually assume their dark ears, nose, feet, and tail.
    Occasionally, however, as I am informed by Mr. W. A. Wooler and the
    Rev. W. D. Fox, the young are born of a very pale grey colour, and
    specimens of such fur were sent me by the former gentleman. The
    grey tint, however, disappears as the animal comes to maturity. So
    that with these Himalayans there is a tendency, strictly confined
    to early youth, to revert to the colour of the adult silver-grey
    parent-stock. Silver-greys and chinchillas, on the other hand,
    present a remarkable contrast with the Himalayans in their colour
    whilst quite young, for they are born perfectly black, but soon
    assume their characteristic grey or silver tints. The same thing
    occurs with grey horses, which, as long as they are foals, are
    generally of a nearly black colour, but soon become grey, and get
    whiter and whiter as they grow older. Hence the usual rule is that
    Himalayans are born white and afterwards become in certain parts of
    their bodies dark-coloured; whilst silver-greys are born black and
    afterwards become sprinkled with white. Exceptions, however, and of
    a directly opposite nature, occasionally occur in both cases. For
    young silver-greys are sometimes born in warrens, as I hear from
    Mr. W. Birch, of a cream-colour, but these young animals ultimately
    become black. The Himalayans, on the other hand, sometimes produce,
    as is stated by an experienced amateur,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> a single black young one in a litter;
    and this, before two months elapse, becomes perfectly white.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To sum up the whole curious case: wild
    silver-greys may be considered as black rabbits which become grey
    at an early period of life. When they are crossed with common
    rabbits, the offspring are said not to have blended colours, but to
    take after either parent; and in this respect they resemble black
    and albino varieties of most quadrupeds, which often transmit their
    colours in this same manner. When they are crossed with
    chinchillas, that is, with a paler sub-variety, the young are at
    first pure albinoes, but soon become dark-coloured in certain parts
    of their bodies, and are then called Himalayans. The young
    Himalayans, however, are sometimes at first either pale grey or
    completely black, in either case changing after a time to white. In
    a future chapter I shall advance a large body of facts showing
    that, when two varieties are crossed both of which differ in colour
    from their parent-stock, there is a strong tendency in the young to
    revert to the aboriginal colour; and what is very remarkable, this
    reversion occasionally supervenes, not before birth, but during the
    growth of the animal. Hence, if it could be shown that silver-greys
    and chinchillas were the offspring of a cross between a black and
    albino variety with the colours intimately blended&#8212;a
    supposition in itself not improbable, and supported by the
    circumstance of silver-greys in warrens sometimes producing
    creamy-white young, which ultimately become black&#8212;then all
    the above given paradoxical facts on the changes of colour in
    silver-greys and in their descendants the Himalayans would come
    under the law of reversion, supervening at different periods of
    growth and in different degrees, either to the original black or to
    the original albino parent-variety.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is, also, remarkable that Himalayans, though
    produced so suddenly; breed true. But as, whilst young, they are
    albinoes, the case falls under a very general rule; albinism being
    well known to be strongly inherited, for instance with white mice
    and many other quadrupeds, and even white flowers. But why, it may
    be asked, do the ears, tail, nose, and feet, and no other part of
    the body, revert to a black colour? This apparently depends on a
    law, which generally holds good, namely, that characters common to
    many species of a genus&#8212;and this, in fact, implies long
    inheritance from the ancient progenitor of the genus&#8212;are
    found to resist variation, or to reappear if lost, more
    persistently than the characters which are confined to the separate
    species. Now, in the genus Lepus, a large majority of the species
    have their ears and the upper surface of the tail tinted black; but
    the persistence of these marks is best seen in those species which
    in winter become white: thus, in Scotland the <I>L.
    variabilis</I><A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> in its winter
    dress has a shade of colour on its nose, and the tips of its ears
    are black: in the <I>L. tibetanus</I> the ears are black, the upper
    surface of the tail greyish-black, and the soles of the feet brown:
    in <I>L. glacialis</I> the winter fur is pure white, except the
    soles of the feet and the points of the ears. Even in the
    variously-coloured fancy rabbits we may often observe a tendency in
    these same parts to be more darkly tinted than the rest of the
    body. Thus the several coloured marks on the Himalayan rabbits, as
    they grow old, are rendered intelligible. I may add a nearly
    analogous case: fancy rabbits very often have a white star on their
    foreheads; and the common English hare, whilst young, generally
    has, as I have myself observed, a similar white star on its
    forehead.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When variously coloured rabbits are set free in
    Europe, and are thus placed under their natural conditions, they
    generally revert to the aboriginal grey colour; this may be in part
    due to the tendency in all crossed animals, as lately observed, to
    revert to their primordial state. But this tendency does not always
    prevail; thus silver-grey rabbits are kept in warrens, and remain
    true though living almost in a state of nature; but a warren must
    not be stocked with both silver-greys and common rabbits; otherwise
    "in a few years there will be none but common greys surviving."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> When rabbits run wild in foreign
    countries under new conditions of life, they by no means always
    revert to their aboriginal colour. In Jamaica the feral rabbits are
    described as having been "slate-coloured, deeply tinted with
    sprinklings of white on the neck, on the shoulders, and on the
    back; softening off to blue-white under the breast and belly."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> But in this tropical island the
    conditions were not favourable to their increase, and they never
    spread widely, and are now extinct, as I hear from Mr. R. Hill,
    owing to a great fire which occurred in the woods. Rabbits during
    many years have run wild in the Falkland Islands; they are abundant
    in certain parts, but do not spread extensively. Most of them are
    of the common grey colour; a few, as I am informed by Admiral
    Sulivan, are hare-coloured, and many are black, often with nearly
    symmetrical white marks on their faces. Hence, M. Lesson described
    the black variety as a distinct species, under the name of <I>Lepus
    magellanicus,</I> but this, as I have elsewhere shown, is an
    error.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> Within recent times the
    sealers have stocked some of the small outlying islets in the
    Falkland group with rabbits; and on Pebble Islet, as I hear from
    Admiral Sulivan, a large proportion are hare-coloured, whereas on
    Rabbit Islet a large proportion are of a bluish colour, which is
    not elsewhere seen. How the rabbits were coloured which were turned
    out of these islets is not known.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The rabbits which have become feral on the
    island of Porto Santo, near Madeira, deserve a fuller account. In
    1418 or 1419, J. Gonzales Zarco<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
    happened to have a female rabbit on board which had produced young
    during the voyage, and he turned them all out on the island. These
    animals soon increased so rapidly, that they became a nuisance, and
    actually caused the abandonment of the settlement. Thirty-seven
    years subsequently, Cada Mosto describes them as innumerable; nor
    is this surprising, as the island was not inhabited by any beast of
    prey or by any terrestrial mammal. We do not know the character of
    the mother-rabbit; but it was probably the common domesticated
    kind. The Spanish peninsula, whence Zarco sailed, is known to have
    abounded with the common wild species at the most remote historical
    period; and as these rabbits were taken on board for food, it is
    improbable that they should have been of any peculiar breed. That
    the breed was well domesticated is shown by the doe having littered
    during the voyage. Mr. Wollaston, at my request, brought home two
    of these feral rabbits in spirits of wine; and, subsequently, Mr.
    W. Haywood sent to me three more specimens in brine, and two alive.
    These seven specimens, though caught at different periods, closely
    resembled each other. They were full grown, as shown by the state
    of their bones. Although the conditions of life in Porto Santo are
    evidently highly favourable to rabbits, as proved by their
    extraordinarily rapid increase, yet they differ conspicuously in
    their small size from the wild English rabbit. Four English
    rabbits, measured from the incisors to the anus, varied between 17
    and 17-3/4 inches in length; whilst two of the Porto Santo rabbits
    were only 14-1/2 and 15 inches in length. But the decrease in size
    is best shown by weight; four wild English rabbits averaged 3
    pounds 5 ounces, whilst one of the Porto Santo rabbits, which had
    lived for four years in the Zoological Gardens, but had become
    thin, weighed only 1 pound 9 ounces. A fairer test is afforded by
    the comparison of the well-cleaned limb-bones of a Porto Santo
    rabbit killed on the island with the same bones of a wild English
    rabbit of average size, and they differed in the proportion of
    rather less than five to nine. So that the Porto Santo rabbits have
    decreased nearly three inches in length, and almost half in weight
    of body.<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> The head has not
    decreased in length proportionally with the body; and the capacity
    of the brain case is, as we shall hereafter see, singularly
    variable. I prepared four skulls, and these resembled each other
    more closely than do generally the skulls of wild English rabbits;
    but the only difference in structure which they presented was that
    the supra-orbital processes of the frontal bones were narrower.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In colour the Porto Santo rabbit differs
    considerably from the common rabbit; the upper surface is redder,
    and is rarely interspersed with any black or black-tipped hairs.
    The throat and certain parts of the under surface, instead of being
    pure white, are generally pale grey or leaden colour. But the most
    remarkable difference is in the ears and tail; I have examined many
    fresh English rabbits, and the large collection of skins in the
    British Museum from various countries, and all have the upper
    surface of the tail and the tips of the ears clothed with
    blackish-grey fur; and this is given in most works as one of the
    specific characters of the rabbit. Now in the seven Porto Santo
    rabbits the upper surface of the tail was reddish-brown, and the
    tips of the ears had no trace of the black edging. But here we meet
    with a singular circumstance: in June, 1861 I examined two of these
    rabbits recently sent to the Zoological Gardens, and their tails
    and ears were coloured as just described; but when one of their
    dead bodies was sent to me in February, 1865, the ears were plainly
    edged, and the upper surface of the tail was covered with
    blackish-grey fur, and the whole body was much less red; so that
    under the English climate this individual rabbit had recovered the
    proper colour of its fur in rather less than four years!</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The two little Porto Santo rabbits, whilst alive
    in the Zoological Gardens, had a remarkably different appearance
    from the common kind. They were extraordinarily wild and active, so
    that many persons exclaimed on seeing them that they were more like
    large rats than rabbits. They were nocturnal to an unusual degree
    in their habits, and their wildness was never in the least subdued;
    so that the superintendent, Mr. Bartlett, assured me that he had
    never had a wilder animal under his charge. This is a singular
    fact, considering that they are descended from a domesticated
    breed. I was so much surprised at it, that I requested Mr. Haywood
    to make inquiries on the spot, whether they were much hunted by the
    inhabitants, or persecuted by hawks, or cats, or other animals; but
    this is not the case, and no cause can be assigned for their
    wildness. They live both on the central, higher rocky land and near
    the sea-cliffs, and, from being exceedingly shy and timid, seldom
    appear in the lower and cultivated districts. They are said to
    produce from four to six young at a birth, and their breeding
    season is in July and August. Lastly, and this is a highly
    remarkable fact, Mr. Bartlett could never succeed in getting these
    two rabbits, which were both males, to associate or breed with the
    females of several breeds which were repeatedly placed with
    them.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If the history of these Porto Santo rabbits had
    not been known, most naturalists, on observing their much reduced
    size, their colour, reddish above and grey beneath, their tails and
    ears not tipped with black, would have ranked them as a distinct
    species. They would have been strongly confirmed in this view by
    seeing them alive in the Zoological Gardens, and hearing that they
    refused to couple with other rabbits. Yet this rabbit, which there
    can be little doubt would thus have been ranked as a distinct
    species, as certainly originated since the year 1420. Finally, from
    the three cases of the rabbits which have run wild in Porto Santo,
    Jamaica, and the Falkland Islands, we see that these animals do
    not, under new conditions of life, revert to or retain their
    aboriginal character, as is so generally asserted to be the case by
    most authors.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When we remember, on the one hand, how
    frequently it is stated that important parts of the structure never
    vary; and, on the other hand, on what small differences in the
    skeleton fossil species have often been founded, the variability of
    the skull and of some other bones in the domesticated rabbit well
    deserves attention. It must not be supposed that the more important
    differences immediately to be described strictly characterise any
    one breed; all that can be said is, that they are generally present
    in certain breeds. We should bear in mind that selection has not
    been applied to fix any character in the skeleton, and that the
    animals have not had to support themselves under uniform habits of
    life. We cannot account for most of the differences in the
    skeleton; but we shall see that the increased size of the body, due
    to careful nurture and continued selection, has affected the head
    in a particular manner. Even the elongation and lopping of the ears
    have influenced in a small degree the form of the whole skull. The
    want of exercise has apparently modified the proportional length of
    the limbs in comparison with that of the body.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">As a standard of comparison, I
    prepared skeletons of two wild rabbits from Kent, one from the
    Shetland Islands, and one from Antrim in Ireland. As all the bones
    in these four specimens from such distant localities closely
    resembled each other, presenting scarcely any appreciable
    difference, it may be concluded that the bones of the wild rabbit
    are generally uniform in character.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1"><I>Skull.</I>&#8212;I have
    carefully examined skulls of ten large lop-eared rabbits, and of
    five common domestic rabbits, which latter differ from the
    lop-eared only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both
    larger than in the wild rabbit. First for the ten lop-eared
    rabbits: in all these the skull is remarkably elongated in
    comparison with its breadth. In a wild rabbit the length was
    3&#183;15 inches, in a large fancy rabbit 4&#183;3; whilst the
    breadth of the cranium enclosing the brain was in both almost
    exactly the same. Even by taking as the standard of comparison the
    widest part of the zygomatic arch, the skulls of the lop-eared are
    proportionally to their breadth three-quarters of an inch too long.
    The depth of the head has increased almost in the same proportion
    with the length; it is the breadth alone which has not increased.
    The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are less
    arched, both in a longitudinal and transverse line, than in the
    wild rabbit, so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat
    different. The surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the
    lines of sutures are more prominent.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">Although the skulls of the large
    lop-eared rabbits in comparison with those of the wild rabbit are
    much elongated relatively to their breadth, yet, relatively to the
    size of body, they are far from elongated. The lop-eared rabbits
    which I examined were, though not fat, more than twice as heavy as
    the wild specimens; but the skull was very far from being twice as
    long. Even if we take the fairer standard of the length of body,
    from the nose to the anus, the skull is not on an average as long
    as it ought to be by a third of an inch. In the small feral Porto
    Santo rabbit, on the other hand, the head relatively to the length
    of body is about a quarter of an inch too long.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">This elongation of the skull
    relatively to its breadth, I find a universal character, not only
    with the large lop-eared rabbits, but in all the artificial breeds;
    as is well seen in the skull of the Angora. I was at first much
    surprised at the fact, and could not imagine why domestication
    could produce this uniform result; but the explanation seems to lie
    in the circumstance that during a number of generations the
    artificial races have been closely confined, and have had little
    occasion to exert either their senses, or intellect, or voluntary
    muscles; consequently the brain, as we shall presently more fully
    see, has not increased relatively with the size of body. As the
    brain has not increased, the bony case enclosing it has not
    increased, and this has evidently affected through correlation the
    breadth of the entire skull from end to end.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">In all the skulls of the large
    lop-eared rabbits, the supra-orbital plates or processes of the
    frontal bones are much broader than in the wild rabbit, and they
    generally project more upwards. In the zygomatic arch the posterior
    or projecting point of the malar-bone is broader and blunter; and
    in the specimen, fig. 8, it is so in a remarkable degree. This
    point approaches nearer to the auditory meatus than in the wild
    rabbit, as may be best seen in fig. 8; but this circumstance mainly
    depends on the changed direction of the meatus. The inter-parietal
    bone (see fig. 9) differs much in shape in the several skulls;
    generally it is more oval, that is more extended in the line of the
    longitudinal axis of the skull, than in the wild rabbit. The
    posterior margin of "the square raised platform"<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> of the occiput, instead of being
    truncated, or projecting slightly as in the wild rabbit, is in most
    lop-eared rabbits pointed, as in fig. 9, C. The paramastoids
    relatively to the size of the skull are generally much thicker than
    in the wild rabbit.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">The occipital foramen (fig. 10)
    presents some remarkable differences: in the wild rabbit, the lower
    edge between the condyles is considerably and almost angularly
    hollowed out, and the upper edge is deeply and squarely notched;
    hence the longitudinal axis exceeds the transverse axis. In the
    skulls of the lop-eared rabbits the transverse axis exceeds the
    longitudinal; for in none of these skulls was the lower edge
    between the condyles so deeply hollowed out; in five of them there
    was no upper square notch, in three there was a trace of the notch,
    and in two alone it was well developed. These differences in the
    shape of the foramen are remarkable, considering that it gives
    passage to so important a structure as the spinal marrow, though
    apparently the outline of the latter is not affected by the shape
    of the passage.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">In all the skulls of the large
    lop-eared rabbits, the bony auditory meatus is conspicuously larger
    than in the wild rabbit. In a skull 4&#183;3 inches in length, and
    which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a wild rabbit (which
    was 3&#183;15 inches in length), the longer diameter of the meatus
    was exactly twice as great. The orifice is more compressed, and its
    margin on the side nearest the skull stands up higher than the
    outer side. The whole meatus is directed more forwards. As in
    breeding lop-eared rabbits the length of the ears, and their
    consequent lopping and lying flat on the face, are the chief points
    of excellence, there can hardly be a doubt that the great change in
    the size, form, and direction of the bony meatus, relatively to
    this same part in the wild rabbit, is due to the continued
    selection of individuals having larger and larger ears. The
    influence of the external ear on the bony meatus is well shown in
    the skulls (I have examined three) of half-lops (see fig. 5), in
    which one ear stands upright, and the other and longer ear hangs
    down; for in these skulls there was a plain difference in the form
    and direction of the bony meatus on the two sides. But it is a much
    more interesting fact, that the changed direction and increased
    size of the bony meatus have slightly affected on the same side the
    structure of the whole skull. I here give a drawing (fig. 11) of
    the skull of a half-lop; and it may be observed that the suture
    between the parietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at
    right angles to the longitudinal axis of the skull; the left
    frontal bone projects beyond the right one; both the posterior and
    anterior margins of the left zygomatic arch on the side of the
    lopping ear stand a little in advance of the corresponding bones on
    the opposite side. Even the lower jaw is affected, and the condyles
    are not quite symmetrical, that on the left standing a little in
    advance of that on the right. This seems to me a remarkable case of
    correlation of growth. Who would have surmised that by keeping an
    animal during many generations under confinement, and so leading to
    the disuse of the muscles of the ears, and by continually selecting
    individuals with the longest and largest ears, he would thus
    indirectly have affected almost every suture in the skull and the
    form of the lower jaw!</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">In the large lop-eared rabbits
    the only difference in the lower jaw, in comparison with that of
    the wild rabbit, is that the posterior margin of the ascending
    ramus is broader and more inflected. The teeth in neither jaw
    present any difference, except that the small incisors, beneath the
    large ones, are proportionately a little longer. The molar teeth
    have increased in size proportionately with the increased width of
    the skull, measured across the zygomatic arch, and not
    proportionally with its increased length. The inner line of the
    sockets of the molar teeth in the upper jaw of the wild rabbit
    forms a perfectly straight line; but in some of the largest skulls
    of the lop-eared this line was plainly bowed inwards. In one
    specimen there was an additional molar tooth on each side of the
    upper jaw, between the molars and premolars; but these two teeth
    did not correspond in size; and as no rodent has seven molars, this
    is merely a monstrosity, though a curious one.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">The five other skulls of common
    domestic rabbits, some of which approach in size the
    above-described largest skulls, whilst the others exceed but little
    those of the wild rabbit, are only worth notice as presenting a
    perfect gradation in all the above-specified differences between
    the skulls of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. In all,
    however, the supra-orbital plates are rather larger, and in all the
    auditory meatus is larger, in conformity with the increased size of
    the external ears, than in the wild rabbit. The lower notch in the
    occipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild rabbit,
    but in all five skulls the upper notch was well
    developed.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">The skull of the <I>Angora</I>
    rabbit, like the latter five skulls, is intermediate in general
    proportions, and in most other characters, between those of the
    largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. It presents only one singular
    character: though considerably longer than the skull of the wild
    rabbit, the breadth measured within the posterior supra-orbital
    fissures is nearly a third less than in the wild. The skulls of the
    <I>silver-grey,</I> and <I>chinchilla</I> and <I>Himalayan</I>
    rabbits are more elongated than in the wild, with broader
    supra-orbital plates, but differ little in any other respect,
    excepting that the upper and lower notches of the occipital foramen
    are not so deep or so well developed. The skull of the <I>Moscow
    rabbit</I> scarcely differs at all from that of the wild rabbit. In
    the Porto Santo feral rabbits the supra-orbital plates are
    generally narrower and more pointed than in our wild
    rabbits.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">As some of the largest lop-eared
    rabbits of which I prepared skeletons were coloured almost like
    hares, and as these latter animals and rabbits have, as it is
    affirmed, been recently crossed in France, it might be thought that
    some of the above-described characters had been derived from a
    cross at a remote period with the hare. Consequently I examined
    skulls of the hare, but no light could thus be thrown on the
    peculiarities of the skulls of the larger rabbits. It is, however,
    an interesting fact, as illustrating the law that varieties of one
    species often assume the characters of other species of the same
    genus, that I found, on comparing the skulls of ten species of
    hares in the British Museum, that they differed from each other
    chiefly in the very same points in which domestic rabbits
    vary,&#8212;namely, in general proportions, in the form and size of
    the supra-orbital plates, in the form of the free end of the malar
    bone, and in the line of suture separating the occipital and
    frontal bones. Moreover two eminently variable characters in the
    domestic rabbit, namely, the outline of the occipital foramen and
    the shape of the "raised platform" of the occiput, were likewise
    variable in two instances in the same species of hare.</FONT></P>

    two exceptions, namely, in one of the small feral Porto Santo
    rabbits and in one of the largest lop-eared kinds; both of these
    had as usual seven cervical, twelve dorsal with ribs, but, instead
    of seven lumbar, both had eight lumbar vertebr&#230;. This is
    remarkable, as Gervais gives seven as the number for the whole
    genus Lepus. The caudal vertebr&#230; apparently differ by two or
    three, but I did not attend to them, and they are difficult to
    count with certainty.</FONT></P>

    could detect no variation; but the bones of the feet were too
    troublesome to compare with much care.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have now described all the differences in the
    skeletons which I have observed. It is impossible not to be struck
    with the high degree of variability or plasticity of many of the
    bones. We see how erroneous the often-repeated statement is, that
    only the crests of the bones which give attachment to muscles vary
    in shape, and that only parts of slight importance become modified
    under domestication. No one will say, for instance, that the
    occipital foramen, or the atlas, or the third cervical vertebra is
    a part of slight importance. If the several vertebr&#230; of the
    wild and lop-eared rabbits, of which figures have been given, had
    been found fossil, pal&#230;ontologists would have declared without
    hesitation that they had belonged to distinct species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1"><I>The effects of the use and
    disuse of parts.</I>&#8212;In the large lop-eared rabbits the
    relative proportional length of the bones of the same leg, and of
    the front and hind legs compared with each other, have remained
    nearly the same as in the wild rabbit; but in weight, the bones of
    the hind legs apparently have not increased in due proportion with
    the front legs. The weight of the whole body in the large rabbits
    examined by me was from twice to twice and a half as great as that
    of the wild rabbit; and the weight of the bones of the front and
    hind limbs taken together (excluding the feet, on account of the
    difficulty of cleaning so many small bones) has increased in the
    large lop-eared rabbits in nearly the same proportion; consequently
    in due proportion to the weight of body which they have to support.
    If we take the length of the body as the standard of comparison,
    the limbs of the large rabbits have not increased in length in due
    proportion by one inch and a half. Again, if we take as the
    standard of comparison the length of the skull, which, as we have
    before seen, has not increased in length in due proportion to the
    length of body, the limbs will be found to be, proportionally with
    those of the wild rabbit, from half to three-quarters of an inch
    too short. Hence, whatever standard of comparison be taken, the
    limb-bones of the large lop-eared rabbits have not increased in
    length, though they have in weight, in full proportion to the other
    parts of the frame; and this, I presume, may be accounted for by
    the inactive life which during many generations they have spent.
    Nor has the scapula increased in length in due proportion to the
    increased length of the body.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">The capacity of the osseous case
    of the brain is a more interesting point, to which I was led to
    attend by finding, as previously stated, that with all domesticated
    rabbits the length of the skull relatively to its breadth has
    greatly increased in comparison with that of the wild rabbits. If
    we had possessed a large number of domesticated rabbits of nearly
    the same size with the wild rabbits, it would have been a simple
    task to have measured and compared the capacities of their skulls.
    But this is not the case: almost all the domestic breeds have
    larger bodies than wild rabbits, and the lop-eared kinds are more
    than double their weight. As a small animal has to exert its
    senses, intellect, and instincts equally with a large animal, we
    ought not by any means to expect an animal twice or thrice as large
    as another to have a brain of double or treble the size.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> Now, after weighing the bodies of four
    wild rabbits, and of four large but not fattened lop-eared rabbits,
    I find that on an average the wild are to the lop-eared in weight
    as 1 to 2&#183;17; in average length of body as 1 to 1&#183;41;
    whilst in capacity of skull they are as 1 to 1&#183;15. Hence we
    see that the capacity of the skull, and consequently the size of
    the brain, has increased but little, relatively to the increased
    size of the body; and this fact explains the narrowness of the
    skull relatively to its length in all domestic rabbits.</FONT></P>

    </TABLE>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">In the upper half of Table 3 I
    have given the measurements of the skull of ten wild rabbits; and
    in the lower half, of eleven thoroughly domesticated kinds. As
    these rabbits differ so greatly in size, it is necessary to have
    some standard by which to compare the capacities of their skulls. I
    have selected the length of skull as the best standard, for in the
    larger rabbits it has not, as already stated, increased in length
    so much as the body; but as the skull, like every other part,
    varies in length, neither it nor any other part affords a perfect
    standard.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">In the first column of figures
    the extreme length of the skull is given in inches and decimals. I
    am aware that these measurements pretend to greater accuracy than
    is possible; but I have found it the least trouble to record the
    exact length which the compass gave. The second and third columns
    give the length and weight of body, whenever these observations
    were made. The fourth column gives the capacity of the skull by the
    weight of small shot with which the skulls were filled; but it is
    not pretended that these weights are accurate within a few grains.
    In the fifth column the capacity is given which the skull ought to
    have had by calculation, according to the length of skull, in
    comparison with that of the wild rabbit No. 1; in the sixth column
    the difference between the actual and calculated capacities, and in
    the seventh the percentage of increase or decrease, are given. For
    instance, as the wild rabbit No. 5 has a shorter and lighter body
    than the wild rabbit No. 1, we might have expected that its skull
    would have had less capacity; the actual capacity, as expressed by
    the weight of shot, is 875 grains, which is 97 grains less than
    that of the first rabbit. But comparing these two rabbits by the
    length of their skulls, we see that in No. 1 the skull is 3&#183;15
    inches in length, and in No. 5 2&#183;96 inches in length;
    according to this ratio, the brain of No. 5 ought to have had a
    capacity of 913 grains of shot, which is above the actual capacity,
    but only by 38 grains. Or, to put the case in another way (as in
    column vii), the brain of this small rabbit, No. 5, for every 100
    grains of weight is only 4 grains too light,&#8212;that is, it
    ought, according to the standard rabbit No. 1, to have been 4 per
    cent heavier. I have taken the rabbit No. 1 as the standard of
    comparison because, of the skulls having a full average length,
    this has the least capacity; so that it is the least favourable to
    the result which I wish to show, namely, that the brain in all
    long-domesticated rabbits has decreased in size, either actually,
    or relatively to the length of the head and body, in comparison
    with the brain of the wild rabbit. Had I taken the Irish rabbit,
    No. 3, as the standard, the following results would have been
    somewhat more striking.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">Turning to Table 3: the first
    four wild rabbits have skulls of the same length, and these differ
    but little in capacity. The Sandon rabbit (No. 4) is interesting,
    as, though now wild, it is known to be descended from a
    domesticated breed, as is still shown by its peculiar colouring and
    longer body; nevertheless the skull has recovered its normal length
    and full capacity. The next three rabbits are wild, but of small
    size, and they all have skulls with slightly lessened capacities.
    The three Porto Santo feral rabbits (Nos. 8 to 10) offer a
    perplexing case; their bodies are greatly reduced in size, as in a
    lesser degree are their skulls in length and in actual capacity, in
    comparison with the skulls of wild English rabbits. But when we
    compare the capacities of the skull in the three Porto Santo
    rabbits, we observe a surprising difference, which does not stand
    in any relation to the slight difference in the length of their
    skulls, nor, as I believe, to any difference in the size of their
    bodies; but I neglected weighing separately their bodies. I can
    hardly suppose that the medullary matter of the brain in these
    three rabbits, living under similar conditions, can differ as much
    as is indicated by the proportional difference of capacity in their
    skulls; nor do I know whether it is possible that one brain may
    contain considerably more fluid than another. Hence I can throw no
    light on this case.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">Looking to the lower half of
    Table 3, which gives the measurements of domesticated rabbits, we
    see that in all the capacity of the skull is less, but in very
    various degrees, than might have been anticipated according to the
    length of their skulls, relatively to that of the wild rabbit No.
    1. In line 22 the average measurements of seven large lop-eared
    rabbits are given. Now the question arises, has the average
    capacity of the skull in these seven large rabbits increased as
    much as might have been expected from the greatly increased size of
    body. We may endeavour to answer this question in two ways: in the
    upper half of the Table we have measurements of the skulls of six
    small wild rabbits (Nos. 5 to 10), and we find that on an average
    the skulls are &#183;18 of an inch shorter, and in capacity 91
    grains less, than the average length and capacity of the three
    first wild rabbits on the list. The seven large lop-eared rabbits,
    on an average, have skulls 4&#183;11 inches in length, and 1136
    grains in capacity; so that these skulls have increased in length
    more than five times as much as the skulls of the six small wild
    rabbits have decreased in length; hence we might have expected that
    the skulls of the large lop-eared rabbits would have increased in
    capacity five times as much as the skulls of the six small rabbits
    have decreased in capacity; and this would have given an average
    increased capacity of 455 grains, whilst the real average increase
    is only 155 grains. Again, the large lop-eared rabbits have bodies
    of nearly the same weight and size as the common hare, but their
    heads are longer; consequently, if the lop-eared rabbits had been
    wild, it might have been expected that their skulls would have had
    nearly the same capacity as that of the skull of the hare. But this
    is far from being the case; for the average capacity of the two
    hare-skulls (Nos. 23, 24) is so much larger than the average
    capacity of the seven lop-eared skulls, that the latter would have
    to be increased 21 per cent to come up to the standard of the
    hare.<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A></FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">I have previously remarked that,
    if we had possessed many domestic rabbits of the same average size
    with the wild rabbit, it would have been easy to compare the
    capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora
    rabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a little larger in
    body and have skulls only a little longer, than the wild animal,
    and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less than in
    the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation (column 7),
    according to the difference in the length of their skulls. The
    narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be
    plainly seen and proved by external measurement. The Chinchilla
    rabbit (No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the wild
    rabbit, yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of
    the wild rabbit. The Angora rabbit, No. 13, offers the most
    remarkable case; this animal in its pure white colour and length of
    silky fur bears the stamp of long domesticity. It has a
    considerably longer head and body than the wild rabbit, but the
    actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even the little
    wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of skull
    the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have
    been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy
    nor idiotic. This case of the Angora rabbit so much surprised me,
    that I repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have
    also compared the capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of
    the wild rabbit by other standards, namely, by the length and
    weight of the body, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all
    these standards the brain appears to be much too small, though in a
    less degree when the standard of the limb-bones was used; and this
    latter circumstance may probably be accounted for by the limbs of
    this anciently domesticated breed having become much reduced in
    weight, from its long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that
    in the Angora breed, which is said to differ from other breeds in
    being quieter and more social, the capacity of the skull has really
    undergone a remarkable amount of reduction.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the several facts above
    given,&#8212;namely, firstly, that the actual capacity of the skull
    in the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora breeds, is less than in the
    wild rabbit, though they are in all their dimensions rather larger
    animals; secondly, that the capacity of the skull of the large
    lop-eared rabbits has not been increased in nearly the same ratio
    as the capacity of the skull of the smaller wild rabbits has been
    decreased; and thirdly, that the capacity of the skull in these
    same large lop-eared rabbits is very inferior to that of the hare,
    an animal of nearly the same size,&#8212;I conclude,
    notwithstanding the remarkable differences in capacity in the
    skulls of the small Porto Santo rabbits, and likewise in the large
    lop-eared kinds, that in all long-domesticated rabbits the brain
    has either by no means increased in due proportion with the
    increased length of the head and increased size of the body, or
    that it has actually decreased in size, relatively to what would
    have occurred had these animals lived in a state of nature. When we
    remember that rabbits, from having been domesticated and closely
    confined during many generations, cannot have exerted their
    intellect, instincts, senses, and voluntary movements, either in
    escaping from various dangers or in searching for food, we may
    conclude that their brains will have been feebly exercised, and
    consequently have suffered in development. We thus see that the
    most important and complicated organ in the whole organisation is
    subject to the law of decrease in size from disuse.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, let us sum up the more important
    modifications which domestic rabbits have undergone, together with
    their causes as far as we can obscurely see them. By the supply of
    abundant and nutritious food, together with little exercise, and by
    the continued selection of the heaviest individuals, the weight of
    the larger breeds has been more than doubled. The bones of the
    limbs taken together have increased in weight, in due proportion
    with the increased weight of body, but the hind legs have increased
    less than the front legs; but in length they have not increased in
    due proportion, and this may have been caused by the want of proper
    exercise. With the increased size of the body the third cervical
    has assumed characters proper to the fourth cervical vertebra; and
    the eighth and ninth dorsal vertebr&#230; have similarly assumed
    characters proper to the tenth and posterior vertebr&#230;. The
    skull in the larger breeds has increased in length, but not in due
    proportion with the increased length of body; the brain has not
    duly increased in dimensions, or has even actually decreased, and
    consequently the bony case for the brain has remained narrow, and
    by correlation has affected the bones of the face and the entire
    length of the skull. The skull has thus acquired its characteristic
    narrowness. From unknown causes the supra-orbital process of the
    frontal bones and the free end of the malar bones have increased in
    breadth; and in the larger breeds the occipital foramen is
    generally much less deeply notched than in wild rabbits. Certain
    parts of the scapula and the terminal sternal bones have become
    highly variable in shape. The ears have been increased enormously
    in length and breadth through continued selection; their weight,
    conjoined probably with the disuse of their muscles, has caused
    them to lop downwards; and this has affected the position and form
    of the bony auditory meatus; and this again, by correlation, the
    position in a slight degree of almost every bone in the upper part
    of the skull, and even the position of the condyles of the lower
    jaw.</P>

      an excellent observer, Mr. R. Hill. This is the only known case
      in which rabbits have become feral in a hot country. They can be
      kept, however, at Loanda (<I>see</I> Livingstone's 'Travels,' p.
      407). In parts of India, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, they
      breed well.</FONT></LI>

      entitled 'Historia Insulana,' written by a Jesuit, the rabbits
      were turned out in 1420. Some authors believe that the island was
      discovered in 1413.</FONT></LI>

      Lipari, where, according to Spallanzani ('Voyage dans les deux
      Siciles,' quoted by Godron, 'De l'Esp&#232;ce,' p. 364), a
      countryman turned out some rabbits which multiplied prodigiously,
      but, says Spallanzani, "les lapins de l'ile de Lipari sont plus
      petits que ceux qu'on &#233;l&#232;ve en domesticit&#233;."</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">These rabbits have run wild for a considerable time in Sandon
      Park, and in other places in Staffordshire and Shropshire. They
      originated, as I have been informed by the gamekeeper, from
      variously-coloured domestic rabbits which had been turned out.
      They vary in colour; but many are symmetrically coloured, being
      white with a streak along the spine, and with the ears and
      certain marks about the head of a blackish-grey tint. They have
      rather longer bodies than common rabbits.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1"><I>See</I> Prof. Owen's remarks on this subject in his paper
      on the 'Zoological Significance of the Brain, etc., of Man,
      etc.,' read before Brit. Association 1862: with respect to Birds,

      <LI><FONT size="-1">This standard is apparently considerably too low, for Dr.
      Crisp ('Proc. Zoolog. Soc.,' 1861, p. 86) gives 210 grains as the
      actual weight of the brain of a hare which weighed 7 pounds, and
      125 grains as the weight of the brain of a rabbit which weighed 3
      pounds 5 ounces, that is, the same weight as the rabbit No. 1 in
      my list. Now the contents of the skull of rabbit No. 1 in shot is
      in my table 972 grains; and according to Dr. Crisp's ratio of 125
      to 210, the skull of the hare ought to have contained 1632 grains
      of shot, instead of only (in the largest hare in my table) 1455
      grains.</FONT></LI>
