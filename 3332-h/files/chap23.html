    <P align="JUSTIFY">If we ask ourselves why this or that character
    has been modified under domestication, we are, in most cases, lost
    in utter darkness. Many naturalists, especially of the French
    school, attribute every modification to the "monde ambiant," that
    is, to changed climate, with all its diversities of heat and cold,
    dampness and dryness, light and electricity, to the nature of the
    soil, and to varied kinds and amount of food. By the term definite
    action, as used in this chapter, I mean an action of such a nature
    that, when many individuals of the same variety are exposed during
    several generations to any particular change in their conditions of
    life, all, or nearly all the individuals, are modified in the same
    manner. The effects of habit, or of the increased use and disuse of
    various organs, might have been included under this head; but it
    will be convenient to discuss this subject in a separate chapter.
    By the term indefinite action I mean an action which causes one
    individual to vary in one way and another individual in another
    way, as we often see with plants and animals after they have been
    subjected for some generations to changed conditions of life. But
    we know far too little of the causes and laws of variation to make
    a sound classification. The action of changed conditions, whether
    leading to definite or indefinite results, is a totally distinct
    consideration from the effects of selection; for selection depends
    on the preservation by man of certain individuals, or on their
    survival under various and complex natural circumstances, and has
    no relation whatever to the primary cause of each particular
    variation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will first give in detail all the facts which
    I have been able to collect, rendering it probable that climate,
    food, etc., have acted so definitely and powerfully on the
    organisation of our domesticated productions, that new
    sub-varieties or races have been thus formed without the aid of
    selection by man or nature. I will then give the facts and
    considerations opposed to this conclusion, and finally we will
    weigh, as fairly as we can, the evidence on both sides.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When we reflect that distinct races of almost
    all our domesticated animals exist in each kingdom of Europe, and
    formerly even in each district of England, we are at first strongly
    inclined to attribute their origin to the definite action of the
    physical conditions of each country; and this has been the
    conclusion of many authors. But we should bear in mind that man
    annually has to choose which animals shall be preserved for
    breeding, and which shall be slaughtered. We have also seen that
    both methodical and unconscious selection were formerly practised,
    and are now occasionally practised by the most barbarous races, to
    a much greater extent than might have been anticipated. Hence it is
    difficult to judge how far differences in the conditions between,
    for instance, the several districts in England, have sufficed to
    modify the breeds which have been reared in each. It may be argued
    that, as numerous wild animals and plants have ranged during many
    ages throughout Great Britain, and still retain the same character,
    the difference in conditions between the several districts could
    not have modified in a marked manner the various native races of
    cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses. The same difficulty of
    distinguishing between the effects of natural selection and the
    definite action of external conditions is encountered in a still
    higher degree when we compare closely allied species inhabiting two
    countries, such as North America and Europe, which do not differ
    greatly in climate, nature of soil, etc., for in this case natural
    selection will inevitably and rigorously have acted during a long
    succession of ages.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Prof. Weismann has suggested<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> that when a variable species enters a new
    and isolated country, although the variations may be of the same
    general nature as before, yet it is improbable that they should
    occur in the same proportional numbers. After a longer or shorter
    period, the species will tend to become nearly uniform in character
    from the incessant crossing of the varying individuals; but owing
    to the proportion of the individuals varying in different ways not
    being the same in the two cases, the final result will be the
    production of two forms somewhat different from one another. In
    cases of this kind it would falsely appear as if the conditions had
    induced certain definite modifications, whereas they had only
    excited indefinite variability, but with the variations in slightly
    different proportional numbers. This view may throw some light on
    the fact that the domestic animals which formerly inhabited the
    several districts in Great Britain, and the half wild cattle lately
    kept in several British parks, differed slightly from one another;
    for these animals were prevented from wandering over the whole
    country and intercrossing, but would have crossed freely within
    each district or park.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From the difficulty of judging how far
    changed conditions have caused definite modifications of structure,
    it will be advisable to give as large a body of facts as possible,
    showing that extremely slight differences within the same country,
    or during different seasons, certainly produce an appreciable
    effect, at least on varieties which are already in an unstable
    condition. Ornamental flowers are good for this purpose, as they
    are highly variable, and are carefully observed. All
    floriculturists are unanimous that certain varieties are affected
    by very slight differences in the nature of the artificial compost
    in which they are grown, and by the natural soil of the district,
    as well as by the season. Thus, a skilful judge, in writing on
    Carnations and Picotees<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> asks
    "where can Admiral Curzon be seen possessing the colour, size, and
    strength which it has in Derbyshire? Where can Flora's Garland be
    found equal to those at Slough? Where do high-coloured flowers
    revel better than at Woolwich and Birmingham? Yet in no two of
    these districts do the same varieties attain an equal degree of
    excellence, although each may be receiving the attention of the
    most skilful cultivators." The same writer then recommends every
    cultivator to keep five different kinds of soil and manure, "and to
    endeavour to suit the respective appetites of the plants you are
    dealing with, for without such attention all hope of general
    success will be vain." So it is with the Dahlia:<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> the Lady Cooper rarely succeeds near
    London, but does admirably in other districts; the reverse holds
    good with other varieties; and again, there are others which
    succeed equally well in various situations. A skilful gardener<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> states that he procured cuttings of
    an old and well-known variety (pulchella) of Verbena, which from
    having been propagated in a different situation presented a
    slightly different shade of colour; the two varieties were
    afterwards multiplied by cuttings, being carefully kept distinct;
    but in the second year they could hardly be distinguished, and in
    the third year no one could distinguish them.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The nature of the season has an especial
    influence on certain varieties of the Dahlia: in 1841 two varieties
    were pre-eminently good, and the next year these same two were
    pre-eminently bad. A famous amateur<A href="#refer"></A> asserts
    that in 1861 many varieties of the Rose came so untrue in
    character, "that it was hardly possible to recognise them, and the
    thought was not seldom entertained that the grower had lost his
    tally." The same amateur<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> states
    that in 1862 two-thirds of his Auriculas produced central trusses
    of flowers, and such trusses are liable not to keep true; and he
    adds that in some seasons certain varieties of this plant all prove
    good, and the next season all prove bad; whilst exactly the reverse
    happens with other varieties. In 1845 the editor of the 'Gardener's
    Chronicle'<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> remarked how singular
    it was that this year many Calceolarias tended to assume a tubular
    form. With Heartsease<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> the blotched
    sorts do not acquire their proper character until hot weather sets
    in; whilst other varieties lose their beautiful marks as soon as
    this occurs.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Analogous facts have been observed with
    leaves: Mr. Beaton asserts<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> that he
    raised at Shrubland, during six years, twenty thousand seedlings
    from the Punch Pelargonium, and not one had variegated leaves; but
    at Surbiton, in Surrey, one-third, or even a greater proportion, of
    the seedlings from this same variety were more or less variegated.
    The soil of another district in Surrey has a strong tendency to
    cause variegation, as appears from information given me by Sir F.
    Pollock. Verlot<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> states that the
    variegated strawberry retains its character as long as grown in a
    dryish soil, but soon loses it when planted in fresh and humid
    soil. Mr. Salter, who is well known for his success in cultivating
    variegated plants, informs me that rows of strawberries were
    planted in his garden in 1859, in the usual way; and at various
    distances in one row, several plants simultaneously became
    variegated; and what made the case more extraordinary, all were
    variegated in precisely the same manner. These plants were removed,
    but during the three succeeding years other plants in the same row
    became variegated, and in no instance were the plants in any
    adjoining row affected.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The chemical qualities, odours, and
    tissues of plants are often modified by a change which seems to us
    slight. The Hemlock is said not to yield conicine in Scotland. The
    root of the <I>Aconitum napellus</I> becomes innocuous in frigid
    climates. The medicinal properties of the Digitalis are easily
    affected by culture. As the <I>Pistacia lentiscus</I> grows
    abundantly in the South of France, the climate must suit it, but it
    yields no mastic. The Laurus sassafras in Europe loses the odour
    proper to it in North America.<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
    Many similar facts could be given, and they are remarkable because
    it might have been thought that definite chemical compounds would
    have been little liable to change either in quality or
    quantity.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The wood of the American Locust-tree
    (<I>Robinia</I>) when grown in England is nearly worthless, as is
    that of the Oak-tree when grown at the Cape of Good Hope.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> Hemp and flax, as I hear from Dr.
    Falconer, flourish and yield plenty of seed on the plains of India,
    but their fibres are brittle and useless. Hemp, on the other hand,
    fails to produce in England that resinous matter which is so
    largely used in India as an intoxicating drug.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The fruit of the Melon is greatly
    influenced by slight differences in culture and climate. Hence it
    is generally a better plan, according to Naudin, to improve an old
    kind than to introduce a new one into any locality. The seed of the
    Persian Melon produces near Paris fruit inferior to the poorest
    market kinds, but at Bordeaux yields delicious fruit.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> Seed is annually brought from Thibet to
    Kashmir<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> and produces fruit
    weighing from four to ten pounds, but plants raised next year from
    seed saved in Kashmir give fruit weighing only from two to three
    pounds. It is well known that American varieties of the Apple
    produce in their native land magnificent and brightly-coloured
    fruit, but these in England are of poor quality and a dull colour.
    In Hungary there are many varieties of the kidney-bean, remarkable
    for the beauty of their seeds, but the Rev. M.J. Berkeley<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> found that their beauty could hardly
    ever be preserved in England, and in some cases the colour was
    greatly changed. We have seen in the ninth chapter, with respect to
    wheat, what a remarkable effect transportal from the north to the
    south of France, and conversely, produced on the weight of the
    grain.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When man can perceive no change in plants or
    animals which have been exposed to a new climate or to different
    treatment, insects can sometimes perceive a marked change. A cactus
    has been imported into India from Canton, Manilla Mauritius, and
    from the hot-houses of Kew, and there is likewise a so-called
    native kind which was formerly introduced from South America; all
    these plants belong to the same species and are alike in
    appearance, but the cochineal insect flourishes only on the native
    kind, on which it thrives prodigiously.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> Humboldt remarks<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> that white men "born in the torrid zone
    walk barefoot with impunity in the same apartment where a European,
    recently landed, is exposed to the attacks of the <I>Pulex
    penetrans.</I>" This insect, the too well-known chigoe, must
    therefore be able to perceive what the most delicate chemical
    analysis fails to discover, namely, a difference between the blood
    or tissues of a European and those of a white man born in the
    tropics. But the discernment of the chigoe is not so surprising as
    it at first appears; for according to Liebig<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> the blood of men with different
    complexions, though inhabiting the same country, emits a different
    odour.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Diseases peculiar to certain localities,
    heights, or climates, may be here briefly noticed, as showing the
    influence of external circumstances on the human body. Diseases
    confined to certain races of man do not concern us, for the
    constitution of the race may play the more important part, and this
    may have been determined by unknown causes. The Plica Polonica
    stands, in this respect, in a nearly intermediate position; for it
    rarely affects Germans, who inhabit the neighbourhood of the
    Vistula, where so many Poles are grievously affected; neither does
    it affect Russians, who are said to belong to the same original
    stock as the Poles.<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> The elevation
    of a district often governs the appearance of diseases; in Mexico
    the yellow fever does not extend above 924 metres; and in Peru,
    people are affected with the <I>verugas</I> only between 600 and
    1600 metres above the sea; many other such cases could be given. A
    peculiar cutaneous complaint, called the <I>Bouton d'Alep,</I>
    affects in Aleppo and some neighbouring districts almost every
    native infant, and some few strangers; and it seems fairly well
    established that this singular complaint depends on drinking
    certain waters. In the healthy little island of St. Helena the
    scarlet-fever is dreaded like the Plague; analogous facts have been
    observed in Chili and Mexico.<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
    Even in the different departments of France it is found that the
    various infirmities which render the conscript unfit for serving in
    the army, prevail with remarkable inequality, revealing, as Boudin
    observes, that many of them are endemic, which otherwise would
    never have been suspected.<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> Any
    one who will study the distribution of disease will be struck with
    surprise at what slight differences in the surrounding
    circumstances govern the nature and severity of the complaints by
    which man is at least temporarily affected.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The modifications as yet referred to are
    extremely slight, and in most cases have been caused, as far as we
    can judge, by equally slight differences in the conditions. But
    such conditions acting during a series of generations would perhaps
    produce a marked effect.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With plants, a considerable change of
    climate sometimes produces a conspicuous result. I have given in
    the ninth chapter the most remarkable case known to me, namely,
    that of varieties of maize, which were greatly modified in the
    course of only two or three generations when taken from a tropical
    country to a cooler one, or conversely. Dr. Falconer informs me
    that he has seen the English Ribston-pippin apple, a Himalayan oak,
    Prunus and Pyrus, all assume in the hotter parts of India a
    fastigiate or pyramidal habit; and this fact is the more
    interesting, as a Chinese tropical species of Pyrus naturally grows
    thus. Although in these cases the changed manner of growth seems to
    have been directly caused by the great heat, we know that many
    fastigiate trees have originated in their temperate homes. In the
    Botanic Gardens of Ceylon the apple-tree<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> "sends out numerous runners under
    ground, which continually rise into small stems, and form a growth
    around the parent-tree.) The varieties of the cabbage which produce
    heads in Europe fail to do so in certain tropical countries.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> The <I>Rhododendron ciliatum</I>
    produced at Kew flowers so much larger and paler-coloured than
    those which it bears on its native Himalayan mountain, that Dr.
    Hooker<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> would hardly have
    recognised the species by the flowers alone. Many similar facts
    with respect to the colour and size of flowers could be
    given.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The experiments of Vilmorin and Buckman
    on carrots and parsnips prove that abundant nutriment produces a
    definite and inheritable effect on the roots, with scarcely any
    change in other parts of the plant. Alum directly influences the
    colour of the flowers of the Hydrangea.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> Dryness seems generally to favour the
    hairiness or villosity of plants. G&#228;rtner found that hybrid
    Verbascums became extremely woolly when grown in pots. Mr. Masters,
    on the other hand, states that the <I>Opuntia leucotricha</I> "is
    well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in a damp heat,
    but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> Slight variations of many kinds, not
    worth specifying in detail, are retained only as long as plants are
    grown in certain soils, of which Sageret<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> gives some instances from his own
    experience. Odart, who insists strongly on the permanence of the
    varieties of the grape, admits<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
    that some varieties, when grown under a different climate or
    treated differently, vary in a slight degree, as in the tint of the
    fruit and in the period of ripening. Some authors have denied that
    grafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion; but
    there is sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly
    affected in size and flavour, the leaves in duration, and the
    flowers in appearance.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>There can be no doubt, from the facts
    given in the first chapter, that European dogs deteriorate in
    India, not only in their instincts but in structure; but the
    changes which they undergo are of such a nature, that they may be
    partly due to reversion to a primitive form, as in the case of
    feral animals. In parts of India the turkey becomes reduced in
    size, "with the pendulous appendage over the beak enormously
    developed."<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> We have seen how soon
    the wild duck, when domesticated, loses its true character, from
    the effects of abundant or changed food, or from taking little
    exercise. From the direct action of a humid climate and poor
    pasture the horse rapidly decreases in size in the Falkland
    Islands. From information which I have received, this seems
    likewise to be the case to a certain extent with sheep in
    Australia.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Climate definitely influences the hairy
    covering of animals; in the West Indies a great change is produced
    in the fleece of sheep, in about three generations. Dr. Falconer
    states<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> that the Thibet mastiff
    and goat, when brought down from the Himalaya to Kashmir, lose
    their fine wool. At Angora not only goats, but shepherd-dogs and
    cats, have fine fleecy hair, and Mr. Ainsworth<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> attributes the thickness of the fleece
    to the severe winters, and its silky lustre to the hot summers.
    Burnes states positively<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> that the
    Karakool sheep lose their peculiar black curled fleeces when
    removed into any other country. Even within the limits of England,
    I have been assured that the wool of two breeds of sheep was
    slightly changed by the flocks being pastured in different
    localities.<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> It has been asserted
    on good authority<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> that horses
    kept during several years in the deep coal-mines of Belgium become
    covered with velvety hair, almost like that on the mole. These
    cases probably stand in close relation to the natural change of
    coat in winter and summer. Naked varieties of several domestic
    animals have occasionally appeared; but there is no reason to
    believe that this is in any way related to the nature of the
    climate to which they have been exposed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It appears at first sight probable that
    the increased size, the tendency to fatten, the early maturity and
    altered forms of our improved cattle, sheep, and pigs, have
    directly resulted from their abundant supply of food. This is the
    opinion of many competent judges, and probably is to a great extent
    true. But as far as form is concerned, we must not overlook the
    more potent influence of lessened use on the limbs and lungs. We
    see, moreover, as far as size is concerned, that selection is
    apparently a more powerful agent than a large supply of food, for
    we can thus only account for the existence, as remarked to me by
    Mr. Blyth, of the largest and smallest breeds of sheep in the same
    country, of Cochin-China fowls and Bantams, of small Tumbler and
    large Runt pigeons, all kept together and supplied with abundant
    nourishment. Nevertheless there can be little doubt that our
    domesticated animals have been modified, independently of the
    increased or lessened use of parts, by the conditions to which they
    have been subjected, without the aid of selection. For instance,
    Prof. R&#252;timeyer<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> shows that
    the bones of domesticated quadrupeds can be distinguished from
    those of wild animals by the state of their surface and general
    appearance. It is scarcely possible to read Nathusius's excellent
    'Vorstudien'<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> and doubt that, with
    the highly improved races of the pig, abundant food has produced a
    conspicuous effect on the general form of the body, on the breadth
    of the head and face, and even on the teeth. Nathusius rests much
    on the case of a purely bred Berkshire pig, which when two months
    old became diseased in its digestive organs, and was preserved for
    observation until nineteen months old; at this age it had lost
    several characteristic features of the breed, and had acquired a
    long, narrow head, of large size relatively to its small body, and
    elongated legs. But in this case and in some others we ought not to
    assume that, because certain characters are lost, perhaps through
    reversion, under one course of treatment, therefore that they were
    at first directly produced by an opposite treatment.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the case of the rabbit, which has
    become feral on the island of Porto Santo, we are at first strongly
    tempted to attribute the whole change&#8212;the greatly reduced
    size, the altered tints of the fur, and the loss of certain
    characteristic marks&#8212;to the definite action of the new
    conditions to which it has been exposed. But in all such cases we
    have to consider in addition the tendency to reversion to
    progenitors more or less remote, and the natural selection of the
    finest shades of difference.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The nature of the food sometimes either
    definitely induces certain peculiarities, or stands in some close
    relation with them. Pallas long ago asserted that the fat-tailed
    sheep of Siberia degenerate and lose their enormous tails when
    removed from certain saline pastures; and recently Erman<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is well known that hemp-seed causes
    bullfinches and certain other birds to become black. Mr. Wallace
    has communicated to me some much more remarkable facts of the same
    nature. The natives of the Amazonian region feed the common green
    parrot (<I>Chrysotis festiva,</I> Linn.) with the fat of large
    Siluroid fishes, and the birds thus treated become beautifully
    variegated with red and yellow feathers. In the Malayan
    archipelago, the natives of Gilolo alter in an analogous manner the
    colours of another parrot, namely, the <I>Lorius garrulus,</I>
    Linn., and thus produce the <I>Lori rajah</I> or King-Lory. These
    parrots in the Malay Islands and South America, when fed by the
    natives on natural vegetable food, such as rice and plaintains,
    retain their proper colours. Mr. Wallace has, also, recorded<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> a still more singular fact. "The
    Indians (of S. America) have a curious art by which they change the
    colours of the feathers of many birds. They pluck out those from
    the part they wish to paint, and inoculate the fresh wound with the
    milky secretion from the skin of a small toad. The feathers grow of
    a brilliant yellow colour, and on being plucked out, it is said,
    grow again of the same colour without any fresh
    operation."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is well known that the shells of
    land-mollusca are affected by the abundance of lime in different
    districts. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire<A href=

    which has recently been carried from Spain to the South of France
    and to the Rio Plata, and in both countries now presents a distinct
    appearance, but whether this has resulted from food or climate is
    not known. With respect to the common oyster, Mr. F. Buckland
    informs me that he can generally distinguish the shells from
    different districts; young oysters brought from Wales and laid down
    in beds where "<I>natives</I>" are indigenous, in the short space
    of two months begin to assume the "native" character. M. Costa<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> has recorded a much more remarkable
    case of the same nature, namely, that young shells taken from the
    shores of England and placed in the Mediterranean, at once altered
    their manner of growth and formed prominent diverging rays, like
    those on the shells of the proper Mediterranean oyster. The same
    individual shell, showing both forms of growth, was exhibited
    before a society in Paris. Lastly, it is well known that
    caterpillars fed on different food sometimes either themselves

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It would be travelling beyond my proper
    limits here to discuss how far organic beings in a state of nature
    are definitely modified by changed conditions. In my 'Origin of
    Species' I have given a brief abstract of the facts bearing on this
    point, and have shown the influence of light on the colours of
    birds, and of residence near the sea on the lurid tints of insects,
    and on the succulency of plants. Mr. Herbert Spencer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> has recently discussed with much ability
    this whole subject on general grounds. He argues, for instance,
    that with all animals the external and internal tissues are
    differently acted on by the surrounding conditions, and they
    invariably differ in intimate structure. So again the upper and
    lower surfaces of true leaves, as well as of stems and petioles,
    when these assume the function and occupy the position of leaves,
    are differently circumstanced with respect to light, etc., and
    apparently in consequence differ in structure. But, as Mr. Herbert
    Spencer admits, it is most difficult in all such cases to
    distinguish between the effects of the definite action of physical
    conditions and the accumulation through natural selection of
    inherited variations which are serviceable to the organism, and
    which have arisen independently of the definite action of these
    conditions.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although we are not here concerned with the
    definite action of the conditions of life on organisms in a state
    of nature, I may state that much evidence has been gained during
    the last few years on this subject. In the United States, for
    instance, it has been clearly proved, more especially by Mr. J. A.
    Allen, that, with birds, many species differ in tint, size of body
    and of beak, and in length of tail, in proceeding from the North to
    the South; and it appears that these differences must be attributed
    to the direct action of temperature.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> With respect to plants I will give a
    somewhat analogous case: Mr. Meehan,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> has compared twenty-nine kinds of
    American trees with their nearest European allies, all grown in
    close proximity and under as nearly as possible the same
    conditions. In the American species he finds, with the rarest
    exceptions, that the leaves fall earlier in the season, and assume
    before their fall a brighter tint; that they are less deeply
    toothed or serrated; that the buds are smaller; that the trees are
    more diffuse in growth and have fewer branchlets; and, lastly, that
    the seeds are smaller&#8212;all in comparison with the
    corresponding European species. Now considering that these
    corresponding trees belong to several distinct orders, and that
    they are adapted to widely different stations, it can hardly be
    supposed that their differences are of any special service to them
    in the New and Old worlds; and if so such differences cannot have
    been gained through natural selection, and must be attributed to
    the long continued action of a different climate.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Galls.</I>&#8212;Another class of facts, not
    relating to cultivated plants, deserves attention. I allude to the
    production of galls. Every one knows the curious, bright-red, hairy
    productions on the wild rose-tree, and the various different galls
    produced by the oak. Some of the latter resemble fruit, with one
    face as rosy as the rosiest apple. These bright colours can be of
    no service either to the gall-forming insect or to the tree, and
    probably are the direct result of the action of the light, in the
    same manner as the apples of Nova Scotia or Canada are brighter
    coloured than English apples. According to Osten Sacken's latest
    revision, no less than fifty-eight kinds of galls are produced on
    the several species of oak, by Cynips with its sub-genera; and Mr.
    B. D. Walsh<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> states that he can
    add many others to the list. One American species of willow, the
    <I>Salix humilis,</I> bears ten distinct kinds of galls. The leaves
    which spring from the galls of various English willows differ
    completely in shape from the natural leaves. The young shoots of
    junipers and firs, when punctured by certain insects, yield
    monstrous growths resembling flowers and fir-cones; and the flowers
    of some plants become from the same cause wholly changed in
    appearance. Galls are produced in every quarter of the world; of
    several sent to me by Mr. Thwaites from Ceylon, some were as
    symmetrical as a composite flower when in bud, others smooth and
    spherical like a berry; some protected by long spines, others
    clothed with yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs, others with
    regularly tufted hairs. In some galls the internal structure is
    simple, but in others it is highly complex; thus M.
    Lacaze-Duthiers<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> has figured in
    the common ink-gall no less than seven concentric layers, composed
    of distinct tissue, namely, the epidermic, sub-epidermic, spongy,
    intermediate, and the hard protective layer formed of curiously
    thickened woody cells, and, lastly, the central mass, abounding
    with starch-granules on which the larv&#230; feed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Galls are produced by insects of various orders,
    but the greater number by species of Cynips. It is impossible to
    read M. Lacaze-Duthiers' discussion and doubt that the poisonous
    secretion of the insect causes the growth of the gall; and every
    one knows how virulent is the poison secreted by wasps and bees,
    which belong to the same group with Cynips. Galls grow with
    extraordinary rapidity, and it is said that they attain their full
    size in a few days;<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> it is certain
    that they are almost completely developed before the larvae are
    hatched. Considering that many gall-insects are extremely small,
    the drop of secreted poison must be excessively minute; it probably
    acts on one or two cells alone, which, being abnormally stimulated,
    rapidly increase by a process of self-division. Galls, as Mr.
    Walsh<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> remarks, afford good,
    constant, and definite characters, each kind keeping as true to
    form as does any independent organic being. This fact becomes still
    more remarkable when we hear that, for instance, seven out of the
    ten different kinds of galls produced on <I>Salix humilis</I> are
    formed by gall-gnats (<I>Cecidomyid&#230;</I>) which "though
    essentially distinct species, yet resemble one another so closely
    that in almost all cases it is difficult, and in most cases
    impossible, to distinguish the full-grown insects one from the
    other."<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> For in accordance with a
    wide-spread analogy we may safely infer that the poison secreted by
    insects so closely allied would not differ much in nature; yet this
    slight difference is sufficient to induce widely different results.
    In some few cases the same species of gall-gnat produces on
    distinct species of willows galls which cannot be distinguished;
    the <I>Cynips fecundatrix,</I> also, has been known to produce on
    the Turkish oak, to which it is not properly attached, exactly the
    same kind of gall as on the European oak.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> These latter facts apparently prove that
    the nature of the poison is a more powerful agent in determining
    the form of the gall than the specific character of the tree which
    is acted on.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As the poisonous secretion of insects belonging
    to various orders has the special power of affecting the growth of
    various plants; as a slight difference in the nature of the poison
    suffices to produce widely different results; and lastly, as we
    know that the chemical compounds secreted by plants are eminently
    liable to be modified by changed conditions of life, we may believe
    it possible that various parts of a plant might be modified through
    the agency of its own altered secretions. Compare, for instance,
    the mossy and viscid calyx of a moss-rose, which suddenly appears
    through bud-variation on a Provence-rose, with the gall of red moss
    growing from the inoculated leaf of a wild rose, with each filament
    symmetrically branched like a microscopical spruce-fir, bearing a
    glandular tip and secreting odoriferous gummy matter.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> Or compare, on the one hand, the fruit
    of the peach, with its hairy skin, fleshy covering, hard shell and
    kernel, and on the other hand one of the more complex galls with
    its epidermic, spongy, and woody layers, surrounding tissue loaded
    with starch granules. These normal and abnormal structures
    manifestly present a certain degree of resemblance. Or, again,
    reflect on the cases above given of parrots which have had their
    plumage brightly decorated through some change in their blood,
    caused by having been fed on certain fishes, or locally inoculated
    with the poison of a toad. I am far from wishing to maintain that
    the moss-rose or the hard shell of the peach-stone or the bright
    colours of birds are actually due to any chemical change in the sap
    or blood; but these cases of galls and of parrots are excellently
    adapted to show us how powerfully and singularly external agencies
    may affect structure. With such facts before us, we need feel no
    surprise at the appearance of any modification in any organic
    being.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I may, also, here allude to the
    remarkable effects which parasitic fungi sometimes produce on
    plants. Reissek<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> has described a
    Thesium, affected by an &#338;cidium, which was greatly modified,
    and assumed some of the characteristic features of certain allied
    species, or even genera. Suppose, says Reissek, "the condition
    originally caused by the fungus to become constant in the course of
    time, the plant would, if found growing wild, be considered as a
    distinct species or even as belonging to a new genus." I quote this
    remark to show how profoundly, yet in how natural a manner, this
    plant must have been modified by the parasitic fungus. Mr. Meehan<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> also states that three species of
    Euphorbia and <I>Portulaca olereacea,</I> which naturally grow
    prostrate, become erect when they are attacked by the &#338;cidium.
    <I>Euphorbia maculata</I> in this case also becomes nodose, with
    the branchlets comparatively smooth and the leaves modified in
    shape, approaching in these respects to a distinct species, namely,
    the <I>E. hypericifolia.</I></SMALL></P>

      <I>Facts and Considerations opposed to the belief that the
      Conditions of Life act in a potent manner in causing definite
      Modifications of Structure</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have alluded to the slight differences in
    species naturally living in distinct countries under different
    conditions; and such differences we feel at first inclined to
    attribute, probably often with justice, to the definite action of
    the surrounding conditions. But it must be borne in mind that there
    exist many animals and plants which range widely and have been
    exposed to great diversities of climate, yet remain uniform in
    character. Some authors, as previously remarked, account for the
    varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants by the definite
    action of the conditions to which they have been exposed in the
    different parts of Great Britain; but there are about 200 plants<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> which are found in every single
    English county; and these plants must have been exposed for an
    immense period to considerable differences of climate and soil, yet
    do not differ. So, again, some animals and plants range over a
    large portion of the world, yet retain the same character.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Notwithstanding the facts previously
    given on the occurrence of highly peculiar local diseases and on
    the strange modifications of structure in plants caused by the
    inoculated poison of insects, and other analogous cases; still
    there are a multitude of variations&#8212;such as the modified
    skull of the niata ox and bulldog, the long horns of Caffre cattle,
    the conjoined toes of the solid-hoofed swine, the immense crest and
    protuberant skull of Polish fowls, the crop of the pouter-pigeon,
    and a host of other such cases&#8212;which we can hardly attribute
    to the definite action, in the sense before specified, of the
    external conditions of life. No doubt in every case there must have
    been some exciting cause; but as we see innumerable individuals
    exposed to nearly the same conditions, and one alone is affected,
    we may conclude that the constitution of the individual is of far
    higher importance than the conditions to which it has been exposed.
    It seems, indeed, to be a general rule that conspicuous variations
    occur rarely, and in one individual alone out of millions, though
    all may have been exposed, as far as we can judge, to nearly the
    same conditions. As the most strongly marked variations graduate
    insensibly into the most trifling, we are led by the same train of
    thought to attribute each slight variation much more to innate
    differences of constitution, however caused, than to the definite
    action of the surrounding conditions.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We are led to the same conclusion by
    considering the cases, formerly alluded to, of fowls and pigeons,
    which have varied and will no doubt go on varying in directly
    opposite ways, though kept during many generations under nearly the
    same conditions. Some, for instance, are born with their beaks,
    wings, tails, legs, etc., a little longer, and others with these
    same parts a little shorter. By the long-continued selection of
    such slight individual differences which occur in birds kept in the
    same aviary, widely different races could certainly be formed; and
    long-continued selection, important as is the result, does nothing
    but preserve the variations which arise, as it appears to us,
    spontaneously.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In these cases we see that domesticated
    animals vary in an indefinite number of particulars, though treated
    as uniformly as is possible. On the other hand, there are instances
    of animals and plants, which, though they have been exposed to very
    different conditions, both under nature and domestication, have
    varied in nearly the same manner. Mr. Layard informs me that he has
    observed amongst the Caffres of South Africa a dog singularly like
    an arctic Esquimaux dog. Pigeons in India present nearly the same
    wide diversities of colour as in Europe; and I have seen chequered
    and simply barred pigeons, and pigeons with blue and white loins,
    from Sierra Leone, Madeira, England, and India. New varieties of
    flowers are continually raised in different parts of Great Britain,
    but many of these are found by the judges at our exhibitions to be
    almost identical with old varieties. A vast number of new
    fruit-trees and culinary vegetables have been produced in North
    America: these differ from European varieties in the same general
    manner as the several varieties raised in Europe differ from one
    another; and no one has ever pretended that the climate of America
    has given to the many American varieties any general character by
    which they can be recognised. Nevertheless, from the facts
    previously advanced on the authority of Mr. Meehan with respect to
    American and European forest-trees it would be rash to affirm that
    varieties raised in the two countries would not in the course of
    ages assume a distinctive character. Dr. M. Masters has recorded a
    striking fact<A href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> bearing on this
    subject: he raised numerous plants of <I>Hybiscus syriacus</I> from
    seed collected in South Carolina and the Holy Land, where the
    parent-plants must have been exposed to considerably different
    conditions; yet the seedlings from both localities broke into two
    similar strains, one with obtuse leaves and purple or crimson
    flowers, and the other with elongated leaves and more or less pink
    flowers.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We may, also, infer the prepotent
    influence of the constitution of the organism over the definite
    action of the conditions of life, from the several cases given in
    the earlier chapters of parallel series of varieties,&#8212;an
    important subject, hereafter to be more fully discussed.
    Sub-varieties of the several kinds of wheat, gourds, peaches, and
    other plants, and to a limited extent sub-varieties of the fowl,
    pigeon, and dog, have been shown either to resemble or to differ
    from one another in a closely corresponding or parallel manner. In
    other cases, a variety of one species resembles a distinct species;
    or the varieties of two distinct species resemble one another.
    Although these parallel resemblances no doubt often result from
    reversion to the former characters of a common progenitor; yet in
    other cases, when new characters first appear, the resemblance must
    be attributed to the inheritance of a similar constitution, and
    consequently to a tendency to vary in the same manner. We see
    something of a similar kind in the same monstrosity appearing and
    reappearing many times in the same species of animal, and, as Dr.
    Maxwell Masters has remarked to me, in the same species of
    plant.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We may at least conclude, that the amount of
    modification which animals and plants have undergone under
    domestication does not correspond with the degree to which they
    have been subjected to changed circumstances. As we know the
    parentage of domesticated birds far better than of most quadrupeds,
    we will glance through the list. The pigeon has varied in Europe
    more than almost any other bird; yet it is a native species, and
    has not been exposed to any extraordinary change of conditions. The
    fowl has varied equally, or almost equally, with the pigeon, and is
    a native of the hot jungles of India. Neither the peacock, a native
    of the same country, nor the guinea-fowl, an inhabitant of the dry
    deserts of Africa, has varied at all, or only in colour. The
    turkey, from Mexico, has varied but little. The duck, on the other
    hand, a native of Europe, has yielded some well-marked races; and
    as this is an aquatic bird, it must have been subjected to a far
    more serious change in its habits than the pigeon or even the fowl,
    which nevertheless have varied in a much higher degree. The goose,
    a native of Europe and aquatic like the duck, has varied less than
    any other domesticated bird, except the peacock.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Bud-variation is, also, important under our
    present point of view, in some few cases, as when all the eyes on
    the same tuber of the potato, or all the fruit on the same
    plum-tree, or all the flowers on the same plant, have suddenly
    varied in the same manner, it might be argued that the variation
    had been definitely caused by some change in the conditions to
    which the plants had been exposed; yet, in other cases, such an
    admission is extremely difficult. As new characters sometimes
    appear by bud-variation, which do not occur in the parent-species
    or in any allied species, we may reject, at least in these cases,
    the idea that they are due to reversion. Now it is well worth while
    to reflect maturely on some striking case of bud-variation, for
    instance that of the peach. This tree has been cultivated by the
    million in various parts of the world, has been treated
    differently, grown on its own roots and grafted on various stocks,
    planted as a standard, trained against a wall, or under glass; yet
    each bud of each sub-variety keeps true to its kind. But
    occasionally, at long intervals of time, a tree in England, or
    under the widely different climate of Virginia, produces a single
    bud, and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears
    nectarines. Nectarines differ, as every one knows, from peaches in
    their smoothness, size, and flavour; and the difference is so great
    that some botanists have maintained that they are specifically
    distinct. So permanent are the characters thus suddenly acquired,
    that a nectarine produced by bud-variation has propagated itself by
    seed. To guard against the supposition that there is some
    fundamental distinction between bud and seminal variation, it is
    well to bear in mind that nectarines have likewise been produced
    from the stone of the peach; and, reversely, peaches from the stone
    of the nectarine. Now is it possible to conceive external
    conditions more closely alike than those to which the buds on the
    same tree are exposed? Yet one bud alone, out of the many thousands
    borne by the same tree, has suddenly, without any apparent cause,
    produced a nectarine. But the case is even stronger than this, for
    the same flower-bud has yielded a fruit, one-half or one-quarter a
    nectarine, and the other half or three-quarters a peach. Again,
    seven or eight varieties of the peach have yielded by bud-variation
    nectarines: the nectarines thus produced, no doubt, differ a little
    from one another; but still they are nectarines. Of course there
    must be some cause, internal or external, to excite the peach-bud
    to change its nature; but I cannot imagine a class of facts better
    adapted to force on our minds the conviction that what we call the
    external conditions of life are in many cases quite insignificant
    in relation to any particular variation, in comparison with the
    organisation or constitution of the being which varies.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is known from the labours of Geoffroy
    Saint-Hilaire, and recently from those of Dareste and others, that
    eggs of the fowl, if shaken, placed upright, perforated, covered in
    part with varnish, etc., produce monstrous chickens. Now these
    monstrosities may be said to be directly caused by such unnatural
    conditions, but the modifications thus induced are not of a
    definite nature. An excellent observer, M. Camille Dareste,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> remarks "that the various species of
    monstrosities are not determined by specific causes; the external
    agencies which modify the development of the embryo act solely in
    causing a perturbation&#8212;a perversion in the normal course of
    development." He compares the result to what we see in illness: a
    sudden chill, for instance, affects one individual alone out of
    many, causing either a cold, or sore-throat, rheumatism, or
    inflammation of the lungs or pleura. Contagious matter acts in an
    analogous manner.<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> We may take a
    still more specific instance: seven pigeons were struck by
    rattle-snakes:<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> some suffered from
    convulsions; some had their blood coagulated, in others it was
    perfectly fluid; some showed ecchymosed spots on the heart, others
    on the intestines, etc.; others again showed no visible lesion in
    any organ. It is well known that excess in drinking causes
    different diseases in different men; but in the tropics the effects
    of intemperance differ from those caused in a cold climate;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> and in this case we see the definite
    influence of opposite conditions. The foregoing facts apparently
    give us as good an idea as we are likely for a long time to obtain,
    how in many cases external conditions act directly, though not
    definitely, in causing modifications of structure.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Summary.</I>&#8212;There can be no doubt,
    from the facts given in this chapter, that extremely slight changes
    in the conditions of life sometimes, probably often, act in a
    definite manner on our domesticated productions; and, as the action
    of changed conditions in causing indefinite variability is
    accumulative, so it may be with their definite action. Hence
    considerable and definite modifications of structure probably
    follow from altered conditions acting during a long series of
    generations. In some few instances a marked effect has been
    produced quickly on all, or nearly all, the individuals which have
    been exposed to a marked change of climate, food, or other
    circumstance. This has occurred with European men in the United
    States, with European dogs in India, with horses in the Falkland
    Islands, apparently with various animals at Angora, with foreign
    oysters in the Mediterranean, and with maize transported from one
    climate to another. We have seen that the chemical compounds of
    some plants and the state of their tissues are readily affected by
    changed conditions. A relation apparently exists between certain
    characters and certain conditions, so that if the latter be changed
    the character is lost&#8212;as with the colours of flowers, the
    state of some culinary plants, the fruit of the melon, the tail of
    fat-tailed sheep, and the peculiar fleeces of other sheep.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The production of galls, and the change of
    plumage in parrots when fed on peculiar food or when inoculated by
    the poison of a toad, prove to us what great and mysterious changes
    in structure and colour, may be the definite result of chemical
    changes in the nutrient fluids or tissues.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We now almost certainly know that organic beings
    in a state of nature may be modified in various definite ways by
    the conditions to which they have been long exposed, as in the case
    of the birds and other animals in the northern and southern United
    States, and of American trees in comparison with their
    representatives in Europe. But in many cases it is most difficult
    to distinguish between the definite result of changed conditions,
    and the accumulation through natural selection of indefinite
    variations which have proved serviceable. If it profited a plant to
    inhabit a humid instead of an arid station, a fitting change in its
    constitution might possibly result from the direct action of the
    environment, though we have no grounds for believing that
    variations of the right kind would occur more frequently with
    plants inhabiting a station a little more humid than usual, than
    with other plants. Whether the station was unusually dry or humid,
    variations adapting the plant in a slight degree for directly
    opposite habits of life would occasionally arise, as we have good
    reason to believe from what we actually see in other cases.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The organisation or constitution of the being
    which is acted on, is generally a much more important element than
    the nature of the changed conditions, in determining the nature of
    the variation. We have evidence of this in the appearance of nearly
    similar modifications under different conditions, and of different
    modifications under apparently nearly the same conditions. We have
    still better evidence of this in closely parallel varieties being
    frequently produced from distinct races, or even distinct species;
    and in the frequent recurrence of the same monstrosity in the same
    species. We have also seen that the degree to which domesticated
    birds have varied, does not stand in any close relation with the
    amount of change to which they have been subjected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To recur once again to bud-variations. When we
    reflect on the millions of buds which many trees have produced,
    before some one bud has varied, we are lost in wonder as to what
    the precise cause of each variation can be. Let us recall the case
    given by Andrew Knight of the forty-year-old tree of the yellow
    magnum bonum plum, an old variety which has been propagated by
    grafts on various stocks for a very long period throughout Europe
    and North America, and on which a single bud suddenly produced the
    red magnum bonum. We should also bear in mind that distinct
    varieties, and even distinct species,&#8212;as in the case of
    peaches, nectarines, and apricots,&#8212;of certain roses and
    camellias,&#8212;although separated by a vast number of generations
    from any progenitor in common, and although cultivated under
    diversified conditions, have yielded by bud-variation closely
    analogous varieties. When we reflect on these facts we become
    deeply impressed with the conviction that in such cases the nature
    of the variation depends but little on the conditions to which the
    plant has been exposed, and not in any especial manner on its
    individual character, but much more on the inherited nature or
    constitution of the whole group of allied beings to which the plant
    in question belongs. We are thus driven to conclude that in most
    cases the conditions of life play a subordinate part in causing any
    particular modification; like that which a spark plays, when a mass
    of combustibles bursts into flame&#8212;the nature of the flame
    depending on the combustible matter, and not on the spark.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">No doubt each slight variation must have its
    efficient cause; but it is as hopeless an attempt to discover the
    cause of each, as to say why a chill or a poison affects one man
    differently from another. Even with modifications resulting from
    the definite action of the conditions of life, when all or nearly
    all the individuals, which have been similarly exposed, are
    similarly affected, we can rarely see the precise relation between
    cause and effect. In the next chapter it will be shown that the
    increased use or disuse of various organs produces an inherited
    effect. It will further be seen that certain variations are bound
    together by correlation as well as by other laws. Beyond this we
    cannot at present explain either the causes or nature of the
    variability of organic beings.</P>
