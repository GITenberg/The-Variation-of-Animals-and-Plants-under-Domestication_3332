    <P align="JUSTIFY">I shall not enter into so much detail on the
    variability of cultivated plants, as in the case of domesticated
    animals. The subject is involved in much difficulty. Botanists have
    generally neglected cultivated varieties, as beneath their notice.
    In several cases the wild prototype is unknown or doubtfully known;
    and in other cases it is hardly possible to distinguish between
    escaped seedlings and truly wild plants, so that there is no safe
    standard of comparison by which to judge of any supposed amount of
    change. Not a few botanists believe that several of our anciently
    cultivated plants have become so profoundly modified that it is not
    possible now to recognise their aboriginal parent-forms. Equally
    perplexing are the doubts whether some of them are descended from
    one species, or from several inextricably commingled by crossing
    and variation. Variations often pass into, and cannot be
    distinguished from, monstrosities; and monstrosities are of little
    significance for our purpose. Many varieties are propagated solely
    by grafts, buds, layers, bulbs, etc., and frequently it is not
    known how far their peculiarities can be transmitted by seminal
    generation. Nevertheless, some facts of value can be gleaned: and
    other facts will hereafter be incidentally given. One chief object
    in the two following chapters is to show how many characters in our
    cultivated plants have become variable.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Before entering on details a few general remarks
    on the origin of cultivated plants may be introduced. M. Alph. De
    Candolle<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> in an admirable
    discussion on this subject, in which he displays a wonderful amount
    of knowledge, gives a list of 157 of the most useful cultivated
    plants. Of these he believes that 85 are almost certainly known in
    their wild state; but on this head other competent judges<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> entertain great doubts. Of 40 of them,
    the origin is admitted by M. De Candolle to be doubtful, either
    from a certain amount of dissimilarity which they present when
    compared with their nearest allies in a wild state, or from the
    probability of the latter not being truly wild plants, but
    seedlings escaped from culture. Of the entire 157, 32 alone are
    ranked by M. De Candolle as quite unknown in their aboriginal
    condition. But it should be observed that he does not include in
    his list several plants which present ill-defined characters,
    namely, the various forms of pumpkins, millet, sorghum,
    kidney-bean, dolichos, capsicum, and indigo. Nor does he include
    flowers; and several of the more anciently cultivated flowers, such
    as certain roses, the common Imperial lily, the tuberose, and even
    the lilac, are said<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> not to be
    known in the wild state.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the relative numbers above given, and from
    other arguments of much weight, M. De Candolle concludes that
    plants have rarely been so much modified by culture that they
    cannot be identified with their wild prototypes. But on this view,
    considering that savages probably would not have chosen rare plants
    for cultivation, that useful plants are generally conspicuous, and
    that they could not have been the inhabitants of deserts or of
    remote and recently discovered islands, it appears strange to me
    that so many of our cultivated plants should be still unknown or
    only doubtfully known in the wild state. If, on the other hand,
    many of these plants have been profoundly modified by culture, the
    difficulty disappears. The difficulty would also be removed if they
    have been exterminated during the progress of civilisation; but M.
    De Candolle has shown that this probably has seldom occurred. As
    soon as a plant was cultivated in any country, the half-civilised
    inhabitants would no longer have need to search the whole surface
    of the land for it, and thus lead to its extirpation; and even if
    this did occur during a famine, dormant seeds would be left in the
    ground. In tropical countries the wild luxuriance of nature, as was
    long ago remarked by Humboldt, overpowers the feeble efforts of
    man. In anciently civilised temperate countries, where the whole
    face of the land has been greatly changed, it can hardly be doubted
    that some plants have become extinct; nevertheless De Candolle has
    shown that all the plants historically known to have been first
    cultivated in Europe still exist here in the wild state.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">MM. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> and De Candolle have remarked that our
    cultivated plants, more especially the cereals, must originally
    have existed in nearly their present state; for otherwise they
    would not have been noticed and valued as objects of food. But
    these authors apparently have not considered the many accounts
    given by travellers of the wretched food collected by savages. I
    have read an account of the savages of Australia cooking, during a
    dearth, many vegetables in various ways, in the hopes of rendering
    them innocuous and more nutritious. Dr. Hooker found the
    half-starved inhabitants of a village in Sikhim suffering greatly
    from having eaten arum-roots,<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
    which they had pounded and left for several days to ferment, so as
    partially to destroy their poisonous nature; and he adds that they
    cooked and ate many other deleterious plants. Sir Andrew Smith
    informs me that in South Africa a large number of fruits and
    succulent leaves, and especially roots, are used in times of
    scarcity. The natives, indeed, know the properties of a long
    catalogue of plants, some having been found during famines to be
    eatable, others injurious to health, or even destructive to life.
    He met a party of Baquanas who, having been expelled by the
    conquering Zulus, had lived for years on any roots or leaves which
    afforded some little nutriment and distended their stomachs, so as
    to relieve the pangs of hunger. They looked like walking skeletons,
    and suffered fearfully from constipation. Sir Andrew Smith also
    informs me that on such occasions the natives observe as a guide
    for themselves, what the wild animals, especially baboons and
    monkeys, eat.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From innumerable experiments made through dire
    necessity by the savages of every land, with the results handed
    down by tradition, the nutritious, stimulating, and medicinal
    properties of the most unpromising plants were probably first
    discovered. It appears, for instance, at first an inexplicable fact
    that untutored man, in three distant quarters of the world, should
    have discovered, amongst a host of native plants, that the leaves
    of the tea-plant and mattee, and the berries of the coffee, all
    included a stimulating and nutritious essence, now known to be
    chemically the same. We can also see that savages suffering from
    severe constipation would naturally observe whether any of the
    roots which they devoured acted as aperients. We probably owe our
    knowledge of the uses of almost all plants to man having originally
    existed in a barbarous state, and having been often compelled by
    severe want to try as food almost everything which he could chew
    and swallow.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From what we know of the habits of savages in
    many quarters of the world, there is no reason to suppose that our
    cereal plants originally existed in their present state so valuable
    to man. Let us look to one continent alone, namely, Africa: Barth<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> states that the slaves over a large
    part of the central region regularly collect the seeds of a wild
    grass, the <I>Pennisetum distichum</I>; in another district he saw
    women collecting the seeds of a Poa by swinging a sort of basket
    through the rich meadow-land. Near Tete, Livingstone observed the
    natives collecting the seeds of a wild grass, and farther south, as
    Andersson informs me, the natives largely use the seed of a grass
    of about the size of canary-seed, which they boil in water. They
    eat also the roots of certain reeds, and every one has read of the
    Bushmen prowling about and digging up with a fire-hardened stake
    various roots. Similar facts with respect to the collection of
    seeds of wild grasses in other parts of the world could be given.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Accustomed as we are to our excellent vegetables
    and luscious fruits, we can hardly persuade ourselves that the
    stringy roots of the wild carrot and parsnip, or the little shoots
    of the wild asparagus, or crabs, sloes, etc., should ever have been
    valued; yet, from what we know of the habits of Australian and
    South African savages, we need feel no doubt on this head. The
    inhabitants of Switzerland during the Stone-period largely
    collected wild crabs, sloes, bullaces, hips of roses, elderberries,
    beechmast, and other wild berries and fruit.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Jemmy Button, a Fuegian on board the
    'Beagle,' remarked to me that the poor and acid black-currants of
    Tierra del Fuego were too sweet for his taste.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The savage inhabitants of each land, having
    found out by many and hard trials what plants were useful, or could
    be rendered useful by various cooking processes, would after a time
    take the first step in cultivation by planting them near their
    usual abodes. Livingstone<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> states
    that the savage Batokas sometimes left wild fruit-trees standing in
    their gardens, and occasionally even planted them, "a practice seen
    nowhere else amongst the natives." But Du Chaillu saw a palm and
    some other wild fruit-trees which had been planted; and these trees
    were considered private property. The next step in cultivation, and
    this would require but little forethought, would be to sow the
    seeds of useful plants; and as the soil near the hovels of the
    natives<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> would often be in some
    degree manured, improved varieties would sooner or later arise. Or
    a wild and unusually good variety of a native plant might attract
    the attention of some wise old savage; and he would transplant it,
    or sow its seed. That superior varieties of wild fruit-trees
    occasionally are found is certain, as in the case of the American
    species of hawthorns, plums, cherries, grapes, and hickories,
    specified by Professor Asa Gray.<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
    Downing also refers to certain wild varieties of the hickory, as
    being "of much larger size and finer flavour than the common
    species." I have referred to American fruit-trees, because we are
    not in this case troubled with doubts whether or not the varieties
    are seedlings which have escaped from cultivation. Transplanting
    any superior variety, or sowing its seeds, hardly implies more
    forethought than might be expected at an early and rude period of
    civilisation. Even the Australian barbarians "have a law that no
    plant bearing seeds is to be dug up after it has flowered;" and Sir
    G. Grey<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> never saw this law,
    evidently framed for the preservation of the plant, violated. We
    see the same spirit in the superstitious belief of the Fuegians,
    that killing water-fowl whilst very young will be followed by "much
    rain, snow, blow much."<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> I may
    add, as showing forethought in the lowest barbarians, that the
    Fuegians when they find a stranded whale bury large portions in the
    sand, and during the often-recurrent famines travel from great
    distances for the remnants of the half-putrid mass.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has often been remarked<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> that we do not owe a single useful plant
    to Australia or the Cape of Good Hope, countries abounding to an
    unparalleled degree with endemic species,&#8212;or to New Zealand,
    or to America south of the Plata; and, according to some authors,
    not to America northward of Mexico. I do not believe that any
    edible or valuable plant, except the canary-grass, has been derived
    from an oceanic or uninhabited island. If nearly all our useful
    plants, natives of Europe; Asia, and South America, had originally
    existed in their present condition, the complete absence of
    similarly useful plants in the great countries just named would be
    indeed a surprising fact. But if these plants have been so greatly
    modified and improved by culture as no longer closely to resemble
    any natural species, we can understand why the above-named
    countries have given us no useful plants, for they were either
    inhabited by men who did not cultivate the ground at all, as in
    Australia and the Cape of Good Hope, or who cultivated it very
    imperfectly, as in some parts of America. These countries do yield
    plants which are useful to savage man; and Dr. Hooker<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> enumerates no less than 107 such species
    in Australia alone; but these plants have not been improved, and
    consequently cannot compete with those which have been cultivated
    and improved during thousands of years in the civilised world.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The case of New Zealand, to which fine island we
    as yet owe no widely cultivated plant, may seem opposed to this
    view; for, when first discovered, the natives cultivated several
    plants; but all inquirers believe, in accordance with the
    traditions of the natives, that the early Polynesian colonists
    brought with them seeds and roots, as well as the dog, which had
    been wisely preserved during their long voyage. The Polynesians are
    so frequently lost on the ocean that this degree of prudence would
    occur to any wandering party: hence the early colonists of New
    Zealand, like the later European colonists, would not have had any
    strong inducement to cultivate the aboriginal plants. According to
    De Candolle we owe thirty-three useful plants to Mexico, Peru, and
    Chile; nor is this surprising when we remember the civilised state
    of the inhabitants, as shown by the fact of their having practised
    artificial irrigation and made tunnels through hard rocks without
    the use of iron or gunpowder, and who, as we shall see in a future
    chapter, fully recognised, as far as animals were concerned, and
    therefore probably in the case of plants, the important principle
    of selection. We owe some plants to Brazil; and the early voyagers,
    namely, Vespucius and Cabral, describe the country as thickly
    peopled and cultivated. In North America<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> the natives cultivated maize, pumpkins,
    gourds, beans, and peas, "all different from ours," and tobacco;
    and we are hardly justified in assuming that none of our present
    plants are descended from these North American forms. Had North
    America been civilised for as long a period, and as thickly
    peopled, as Asia or Europe, it is probable that the native vines,
    walnuts, mulberries, crabs, and plums, would have given rise, after
    a long course of cultivation, to a multitude of varieties, some
    extremely different from their parent-stocks; and escaped seedlings
    would have caused in the New, as in the Old World, much perplexity
    with respect to their specific distinctness and parentage.'<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Cerealia.</I>&#8212;I will now enter
    on details. The cereals cultivated in Europe consist of four
    genera&#8212;wheat, rye, barley, and oats. Of wheat the best modern
    authorities<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> make four or five, or
    even seven distinct species; of rye, one; of barley, three; and of
    oats, two, three, or four species. So that altogether our cereals
    are ranked by different authors under from ten to fifteen distinct
    species. These have given rise to a multitude of varieties. It is a
    remarkable fact that botanists are not universally agreed on the
    aboriginal parent-form of any one cereal plant. For instance, a
    high authority writes in 1855,<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
    "We ourselves have no hesitation in stating our conviction, as the
    result of all the most reliable evidence, that none of these
    Cerealia exist, or have existed, truly wild in their present state,
    but that all are cultivated varieties of species now growing in
    great abundance in S. Europe or W. Asia." On the other hand, Alph.
    De Candolle<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> has adduced abundant
    evidence that common wheat (<I>Triticum vulgare</I>) has been found
    wild in various parts of Asia, where it is not likely to have
    escaped from cultivation: and there is some force in M. Godron's
    remark, that, supposing these plants to be escaped seedlings,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> as they have propagated themselves
    in a wild state for several generations, their continued
    resemblance to cultivated wheat renders it probable that the latter
    has retained its aboriginal character. But the strong tendency to
    inheritance, which most of the varieties of wheat evince, as we
    shall presently see, is here greatly undervalued. Much weight must
    also be attributed to a remark by Professor Hildebrand<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> that when the seeds or fruit of
    cultivated plants possess qualities disadvantageous to them as a
    means of distribution, we may feel almost sure that they no longer
    retain their aboriginal condition. On the other hand, M. De
    Candolle insists strongly on the frequent occurrence in the
    Austrian dominions of rye and of one kind of oats in an apparently
    wild condition. With the exception of these two cases, which
    however are rather doubtful, and with the exception of two forms of
    wheat and one of barley, which he believes to have been found truly
    wild, M. De Candolle does not seem fully satisfied with the other
    reported discoveries of the parent-forms of our other cereals. With
    respect to oats, according to Mr. Buckmann,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> the wild English <I>Avena fatua</I> can
    be converted by a few years of careful cultivation and selection
    into forms almost identical with two very distinct cultivated
    races. The whole subject of the origin and specific distinctness of
    the various cereal plants is a most difficult one; but we shall
    perhaps be able to judge a little better after considering the
    amount of variation which wheat has undergone.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Metzger describes seven species of wheat,
    Godron refers to five, and De Candolle to only four. It is not
    improbable that, besides the kinds known in Europe, other strongly
    characterised forms exist in the more distant parts of the world;
    for Loiseleur-Deslongchamps<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
    speaks of three new species or varieties, sent to Europe in 1822
    from Chinese Mongolia, which he considers as being there
    indigenous. Moorcroft<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> also speaks
    of Hasora wheat in Ladakh as very peculiar. If those botanists are
    right who believe that at least seven species of wheat originally
    existed, then the amount of variation in any important character
    which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight; but if
    only four or a lesser number of species originally existed, then it
    is evident that varieties have arisen so strongly marked, that they
    have been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct.
    But the impossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as
    species and which as varieties, makes it useless to specify in
    detail the differences between the various kinds of wheat. Speaking
    generally, the organs of vegetation differ little;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> but some kinds grow close and upright,
    whilst others spread and trail along the ground. The straw differs
    in being more or less hollow, and in quality. The ears<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> differ in colour and in shape, being
    quadrangular, compressed, or nearly cylindrical; and the florets
    differ in their approximation to each other, in their pubescence,
    and in being more or less elongated. The presence or absence of
    barbs is a conspicuous difference, and in certain Gramine&#230;
    serves even as a generic character;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> although, as remarked by Godron,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> the presence of barbs is variable in
    certain wild grasses, and especially in those such as <I>Bromus
    secalinus</I> and <I>Lolium temulentum,</I> which habitually grow
    mingled with our cereal crops, and which have thus unintentionally
    been exposed to culture. The grains differ in size, weight, and
    colour; in being more or less downy at one end, in being smooth or
    wrinkled, in being either nearly globular, oval, or elongated; and
    finally in internal texture, being tender or hard, or even almost
    horny, and in the proportion of gluten which they
    contain.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Nearly all the races or species of wheat
    vary, as Godron<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> has remarked, in
    an exactly parallel manner,&#8212;in the seed being downy or
    glabrous, and in colour,&#8212;and in the florets being barbed or
    not barbed, etc. Those who believe that all the kinds are descended
    from a single wild species may account for this parallel variation
    by the inheritance of a similar constitution, and a consequent
    tendency to vary in the same manner; and those who believe in the
    general theory of descent with modification may extend this view to
    the several species of wheat, if such ever existed in a state of
    nature.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although few of the varieties of wheat
    present any conspicuous difference, their number is great. Dalbret
    cultivated during thirty years from 150 to 160 kinds, and excepting
    in the quality of the grain they all kept true; Colonel Le Couteur
    possessed upwards of 150, and Philippar 322 varieties.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> As wheat is an annual, we thus see how
    strictly many trifling differences in character are inherited
    through many generations. Colonel Le Couteur insists strongly on
    this same fact. In his persevering and successful attempts to raise
    new varieties, he found that there was only one "secure mode to
    ensure the growth of pure sorts, namely, to grow them from single
    grains or from single ears, and to follow up the plan by afterwards
    sowing only the produce of the most productive so as to form a
    stock." But Major Hallett<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> has
    gone much farther, and by the continued selection of plants from
    the grains of the same ear, during successive generations, has made
    his 'Pedigree in Wheat' (and other cereals) now famous in many
    quarters of the world. The great amount of variability in the
    plants of the same variety is another interesting point, which
    would never have been detected except by an eye long practised to
    the work; thus Colonel Le Couteur relates<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> that in a field of his own wheat, which
    he considered at least as pure as that of any of his neighbours,
    Professor La Gasca found twenty-three sorts; and Professor Henslow
    has observed similar facts. Besides such individual variations,
    forms sufficiently well marked to be valued and to become widely
    cultivated sometimes suddenly appear: thus Mr. Shirreff has had the
    good fortune to raise in his lifetime seven new varieties, which
    are now extensively grown in many parts of Britain.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As in the case of many other plants, some
    varieties, both old and new, are far more constant in character
    than others. Colonel Le Couteur was forced to reject some of his
    new sub-varieties, which he suspected had been produced from a
    cross, as incorrigibly sportive. On the other hand Major Hallett<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> has shown how wonderfully constant
    some varieties are, although not ancient ones, and although
    cultivated in various countries. With respect to the tendency to
    vary, Metzger<A href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> gives from his own
    experience some interesting facts: he describes three Spanish
    sub-varieties, more especially one known to be constant in Spain,
    which in Germany assumed their proper character only during hot
    summers; another variety kept true only in good land, but after
    having been cultivated for twenty-five years became more constant.
    He mentions two other sub-varieties which were at first inconstant,
    but subsequently became, apparently without any selection,
    accustomed to their new homes, and retained their proper character.
    These facts show what small changes in the conditions of life cause
    variability, and they further show that a variety may become
    habituated to new conditions. One is at first inclined to conclude
    with Loiseleur-Deslongchamps, that wheat cultivated in the same
    country is exposed to remarkably uniform conditions; but manures
    differ, seed is taken from one soil to another, and, what is far
    more important, the plants are exposed as little as possible to
    struggle with other plants, and are thus enabled to exist under
    diversified conditions. In a state of nature each plant is confined
    to that particular station and kind of nutriment which it can seize
    from the other plants by which it is surrounded.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Wheat quickly assumes new habits of life.
    The summer and winter kinds were classed by Linn&#230;us as
    distinct species; but M. Monnier<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
    has proved that the difference between them is only temporary. He
    sowed winter-wheat in spring, and out of one hundred plants four
    alone produced ripe seeds; these were sown and resown, and in three
    years plants were reared which ripened all their seed. Conversely,
    nearly all the plants raised from summer-wheat, which was sown in
    autumn, perished from frost; but a few were saved and produced
    seed, and in three years this summer-variety was converted into a
    winter-variety. Hence it is not surprising that wheat soon becomes
    to a certain extent acclimatised, and that seed brought from
    distant countries and sown in Europe vegetates at first, or even
    for a considerable period,<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
    differently from our European varieties. In Canada the first
    settlers, according to Kalm,<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
    found their winters too severe for winter-wheat brought from
    France, and their summers often too short for summer-wheat; and
    they thought that their country was useless for corn crops until
    they procured summer-wheat from the northern parts of Europe, which
    succeeded well. It is notorious that the proportion of gluten
    differs much under different climates. The weight of the grain is
    also quickly affected by climate: Loiseleur-Deslongchamps<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> sowed near Paris 54 varieties, obtained
    from the South of France and from the Black Sea, and 52 of these
    yielded seed from 10 to 40 per cent heavier than the parent-seed.
    He then sent these heavier grains back to the South of France, but
    there they immediately yielded lighter seed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>All those who have closely attended to
    the subject insist on the close adaptation of numerous varieties of
    wheat to various soils and climates even within the same country;
    thus Colonel Le Couteur<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> says, "It
    is the suitableness of each sort to each soil that will enable the
    farmer to pay his rent by sowing one variety, where he would be
    unable to do so by attempting to grow another of a seemingly better
    sort." This may be in part due to each kind becoming habituated to
    its conditions of life, as Metzger has shown certainly occurs, but
    it is probably in main part due to innate differences between the
    several varieties.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Much has been written on the
    deterioration of wheat; that the quality of the flour, size of
    grain, time of flowering, and hardness, may be modified by climate
    and soil, seems nearly certain; but that the whole body of any one
    sub-variety ever becomes changed into another and distinct
    sub-variety, there is no reason to believe. What apparently does
    take place, according to Le Couteur,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> is, that some one sub-variety out of the
    many which may always be detected in the same field is more
    prolific than the others, and gradually supplants the variety which
    was first sown.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the natural crossing of
    distinct varieties the evidence is conflicting, but preponderates
    against its frequent occurrence. Many authors maintain that
    impregnation takes place in the closed flower, but I am sure from
    my own observation that this is not the case, at least with those
    varieties to which I have attended. But as I shall have to discuss
    this subject in another work, it may be here passed
    over.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, all authors admit that numerous
    varieties of wheat have arisen; but their differences are
    unimportant, unless, indeed, some of the so-called species are
    ranked as varieties. Those who believe that from four to seven wild
    species of Triticum originally existed in nearly the same condition
    as at present, rest their belief chiefly on the great antiquity of
    the several forms.<A href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> It is an
    important fact, which we have recently learnt from the admirable
    researches of Heer,<A href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> that the
    inhabitants of Switzerland, even so early as the Neolithic period,
    cultivated no less than ten cereal plants, namely, five kinds of
    wheat, of which at least four are commonly looked at as distinct
    species, three kinds of barley, a panicum, and a setaria. If it
    could be shown that at the earliest dawn of agriculture five kinds
    of wheat and three of barley had been cultivated, we should of
    course be compelled to look at these forms as distinct species.
    But, as Heer has remarked, agriculture even at the Neolithic
    period, had already made considerable progress; for, besides the
    cereals, peas, poppies, flax, and apparently apples, were
    cultivated. It may also be inferred, from one variety of wheat
    being the so called Egyptian, and from what is known of the native
    country of the panicum and setaria, as well as from the nature of
    the weeds which then grew mingled with the crops, that the
    lake-inhabitants either still kept up commercial intercourse with
    some southern people or had originally proceeded as colonists from
    the South.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Loiseleur-Deslongchamps<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> has argued that, if our cereal plants
    have been greatly modified by cultivation, the weeds which
    habitually grow mingled with them would have been equally modified.
    But this argument shows how completely the principle of selection
    has been overlooked. That such weeds have not varied, or at least
    do not vary now in any extreme degree, is the opinion of Mr. H. C.
    Watson and Professor Asa Gray, as they inform me; but who will
    pretend to say that they do not vary as much as the individual
    plants of the same sub-variety of wheat? We have already seen that
    pure varieties of wheat, cultivated in the same field, offer many
    slight variations, which can be selected and separately propagated;
    and that occasionally more strongly pronounced variations appear,
    which, as Mr. Shirreff has proved, are well worthy of extensive
    cultivation. Not until equal attention be paid to the variability
    and selection of weeds, can the argument from their constancy under
    unintentional culture be of any value. In accordance with the
    principles of selection we can understand how it is that in the
    several cultivated varieties of wheat the organs of vegetation
    differ so little; for if a plant with peculiar leaves appeared, it
    would be neglected unless the grains of corn were at the same time
    superior in quality or size. the selection of seed-corn was
    strongly recommended<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> in ancient
    times by Columella and Celsus; and as Virgil says,&#8212;</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <SMALL>"I've seen the largest seeds, tho' view'd with care,<BR>
      Degenerate, unless th' industrious hand<BR>
      Did yearly cull the largest."</SMALL>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <BR>


    <P align="JUSTIFY">But whether in ancient times selection was
    methodically pursued we may well doubt, when we hear how laborious
    the work has been found by Le Coutour and Hallett. Although the
    principle of selection is so important, yet the little which man
    has effected, by incessant efforts<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> during thousands of years, in rendering
    the plants more productive or the grains more nutritious than they
    were in the time of the old Egyptians, would seem to speak strongly
    against its efficacy. But we must not forget that at each
    successive period the state of agriculture and the quantity of
    manure supplied to the land will have determined the maximum degree
    of productiveness; for it would be impossible to cultivate a highly
    productive variety, unless the land contained a sufficient supply
    of the necessary chemical elements.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We now know that man was sufficiently civilised
    to cultivate the ground at an immensely remote period; so that
    wheat might have been improved long ago up to that standard of
    excellence which was possible under the then existing state of
    agriculture. One small class of facts supports this view of the
    slow and gradual improvement of our cereals. In the most ancient
    lake-habitations of Switzerland, when men employed only
    flint-tools, the most extensively cultivated wheat was a peculiar
    kind, with remarkably small ears and grains.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> "Whilst the grains of the modern forms
    are in section from seven to eight millimetres in length, the
    larger grains from the lake-habitations are six, seldom seven, and
    the smaller ones only four. The ear is thus much narrower, and the
    spikelets stand out more horizontally, than in our present forms."
    So again with barley, the most ancient and most extensively
    cultivated kind had small ears, and the grains were "smaller,
    shorter, and nearer to each other, than in that now grown; without
    the husk they were 2&#189; lines long, and scarcely 1&#189; broad,
    whilst those now grown have a length of three lines, and almost the
    same in breadth."<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> These
    small-grained varieties of wheat and barley are believed by Heer to
    be the parent-forms of certain existing allied varieties, which
    have supplanted their early progenitors.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Heer gives an interesting account of the first
    appearance and final disappearance of the several plants which were
    cultivated in greater or less abundance in Switzerland during
    former successive periods, and which generally differed more or
    less from our existing varieties. The peculiar small-eared and
    small-grained wheat, already alluded to, was the commonest kind
    during the Stone period; it lasted down to the Helvetico-Roman age,
    and then became extinct. A second kind was rare at first, but
    afterwards became more frequent. A third, the Egyptian wheat (<I>T.
    turgidum</I>), does not agree exactly with any existing variety,
    and was rare during the Stone period. A fourth kind (<I>T.
    dicoccum</I>) differs from all known varieties of this form. A
    fifth kind (<I>T. monococcum</I>) is known to have existed during
    the Stone period only by the presence of a single ear. A sixth
    kind, the common <I>T. spelta,</I> was not introduced into
    Switzerland until the Bronze age. Of barley, besides the
    short-eared and small-grained kind, two others were cultivated, one
    of which was very scarce, and resembled our present common <I>H.
    distichum.</I> During the Bronze age rye and oats were introduced;
    the oat-grains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our
    existing varieties. The poppy was largely cultivated during the
    Stone period, probably for its oil; but the variety which then
    existed is not now known. A peculiar pea with small seeds lasted
    from the Stone to the Bronze age, and then became extinct; whilst a
    peculiar bean, likewise having small seeds, came in at the Bronze
    period and lasted to the time of the Romans. These details sound
    like the descriptions given by pal&#230;ontologists of the first
    appearance, the increasing rarity, and final extinction or
    modification of fossil species, embedded in the successive stages
    of a geological formation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, every one must judge for himself
    whether it is more probable that the several forms of wheat,
    barley, rye, and oats are descended from between ten and fifteen
    species, most of which are now either unknown or extinct, or
    whether they are descended from between four and eight species,
    which may have either closely resembled our present cultivated
    forms, or have been so widely different as to escape
    identification. In this latter case we must conclude that man
    cultivated the cereals at an enormously remote period, and that he
    formerly practised some degree of selection, which in itself is not
    improbable. We may, perhaps, further believe that, when wheat was
    first cultivated the ears and grains increased quickly in size, in
    the same manner as the roots of the wild carrot and parsnip are
    known to increase quickly in bulk under cultivation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Maize or Indian Corn: Zea
    mays.</I>&#8212;Botanists are nearly unanimous that all the
    cultivated kinds belong to the same species. It is undoubtedly<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> of American origin, and was grown
    by the aborigines throughout the continent from New England to
    Chili. Its cultivation must have been extremely ancient, for
    Tschudi<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> describes two kinds, now
    extinct or not known in Peru, which were taken from tombs
    apparently prior to the dynasty of the Incas. 'But there is even
    stronger evidence of antiquity, for I found on the coast of Peru<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> heads of maize, together with
    eighteen species of recent sea-shell, embedded in a beach which had
    been upraised at least 85 feet above the level of the sea. In
    accordance with this ancient cultivation, numerous American
    varieties have arisen. The aboriginal form has not as yet been
    discovered in the wild state. A peculiar kind,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> in which the grains, instead of being
    naked, are concealed by husks as much as eleven lines in length,
    has been stated, but on insufficient evidence, to grow wild in
    Brazil. It is almost certain that the aboriginal form would have
    had its grains thus protected;<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
    but the seeds of the Brazilian variety produce, as I hear from
    Professor Asa Gray, and as is stated in two published accounts,
    either common or husked maize; and it is not credible that a wild
    species, when first cultivated, should vary so quickly and in so
    great a degree.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Maize has varied in an extraordinary and
    conspicuous manner. Metzger,<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> who
    paid particular attention to the cultivation of this plant, makes
    twelve races (unter-art) with numerous sub-varieties: of the latter
    some are tolerably constant, others quite inconstant. The different
    races vary in height from 15-18 feet to only 16-18 inches, as in a
    dwarf variety described by Bonafous. The whole ear is variable in
    shape, being long and narrow, or short and thick, or branched. The
    ear in one variety is more than four times as long as in a dwarf
    kind. The seeds are arranged in the ear in from six to even twenty
    rows, or are placed irregularly. The seeds are
    coloured&#8212;white, pale-yellow, orange, red, violet, or
    elegantly streaked with black;<A href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
    and in the same ear there are sometimes seeds of two colours. In a
    small collection I found that a single grain of one variety nearly
    equalled in weight seven grains of another variety. The shape of
    the seed varies greatly, being very flat, or nearly globular, or
    oval; broader than long, or longer than broad; without any point,
    or produced into a sharp tooth, and this tooth is sometimes
    recurved. One variety (the rugosa of Bonafous, and which is
    extensively cultivated in the United States as sweet corn) has its
    seeds curiously wrinkled, giving to the whole ear a singular
    appearance. Another variety (the cymosa of Bon.) carries its ears
    so crowded together that it is called <I>ma&#239;s &#224;
    bouquet.</I> The seeds of some varieties contain much glucose
    instead of starch. Male flowers sometimes appear amongst the female
    flowers, and Mr. J. Scott has lately observed the rarer case of
    female flowers on a true male panicle, and likewise hermaphrodite
    flowers.<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> Azara describes<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> a variety in Paraguay the grains of
    which are very tender, and he states that several varieties are
    fitted for being cooked in various ways. The varieties also differ
    greatly in precocity, and have different powers of resisting
    dryness and the action of violent wind.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> Some of the foregoing differences would
    certainly be considered of specific value with plants in a state of
    nature.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Le Comte R&#233; states that the grains
    of all the varieties which he cultivated ultimately assumed a
    yellow colour. But Bonafous<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> found
    that most of those which he sowed for ten consecutive years kept
    true to their proper tints; and he adds that in the valleys of the
    Pyrenees and on the plains of Piedmont a white maize has been
    cultivated for more than a century, and has undergone no
    change.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The tall kinds grown in southern
    latitudes, and therefore exposed to great heat, require from six to
    seven months to ripen their seed; whereas the dwarf kinds, grown in
    northern and colder climates, require only from three to four
    months.<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> Peter Kalm,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> who particularly attended to this plant,
    says, that in the United States, in proceeding from south to north,
    the plants steadily diminish in bulk. Seeds brought from lat.
    37&#176; in Virginia, and sown in lat. 43&#176;-44&#176; in New
    England, produce plants which will not ripen their seed, or ripen
    them with the utmost difficulty. So it is with seed carried from
    New England to lat. 45&#176;-47&#176; in Canada. By taking great
    care at first, the southern kinds after some years' culture ripen
    their seed perfectly in their northern homes, so that this is an
    analogous case with that of the conversion of summer into winter
    wheat, and conversely. When tall and dwarf maize are planted
    together, the dwarf kinds are in full flower before the others have
    produced a single flower; and in Pennsylvania they ripen their
    seeds six weeks earlier than the tall maize. Metzger also mentions
    a European maize which ripens its seed four weeks earlier than
    another European kind. With these facts, so plainly showing
    inherited acclimatisation, we may readily believe Kalm, who states
    that in North America maize and some other plants have gradually
    been cultivated further and further northward. All writers agree
    that to keep the varieties of maize pure they must be planted
    separately so that they shall not cross.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The effects of the climate of Europe on
    the American varieties is highly remarkable. Metzger obtained seed
    from various parts of America, and cultivated several kinds in
    Germany. I will give an abstract of the changes observed<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> in one case, namely, with a tall kind
    (Breit-korniger mais, <I>Zea altissima</I>) brought from the warmer
    parts of America. During the first year the plants were twelve feet
    high, and a few seeds were perfected; the lower seeds in the ear
    kept true to their proper form, but the upper seeds became slightly
    changed. In the second generation the plants were from nine to ten
    feet in height, and ripened their seed better; the depression on
    the outer side of the seed had almost disappeared, and the original
    beautiful white colour had become duskier. Some of the seeds had
    even become yellow, and in their now rounded form they approached
    common European maize. In the third generation nearly all
    resemblance to the original and very distinct American parent-form
    was lost. In the sixth generation this maize perfectly resembled a
    European variety, described as the second sub-variety of the fifth
    race. When Metzger published his book, this variety was still
    cultivated near Heidelberg, and could be distinguished from the
    common kind only by a somewhat more vigorous growth. Analogous
    results were obtained by the cultivation of another American race,
    the "white-tooth corn," in which the tooth nearly disappeared even
    in the second generation. A third race, the "chicken-corn," did not
    undergo so great a change, but the seeds became less polished and
    pellucid. In the above cases the seeds were carried from a warm to
    a colder climate. But Fritz M&#252;ller informs me that a dwarf
    variety with small rounded seeds (papa-gaien-mais), introduced from
    Germany into S. Brazil, produces plants as tall, with seeds as
    flat, as those of the kind commonly cultivated there.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These facts afford the most remarkable instance
    known to me of the direct and prompt action of climate on a plant.
    It might have been expected that the tallness of the stem, the
    period of vegetation, and the ripening of the seed, would have been
    thus affected; but it is a much more surprising fact that the seeds
    should have undergone so rapid and great a change. As, however,
    flowers, with their product the seed, are formed by the
    metamorphosis of the stem and leaves, any modification in these
    latter organs would be apt to extend, through correlation, to the
    organs of fructification.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Cabbage (Brassica
    oleracea).</I>&#8212;Every one knows how greatly the various kinds
    of cabbage differ in appearance. In the Island of Jersey, from the
    effects of particular culture and of climate a stalk has grown to
    the height of sixteen feet, and "had its spring shoots at the top
    occupied by a magpie's nest:" the woody stems are not unfrequently
    from ten to twelve feet in height, and are there used as rafters<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> and as walking-sticks. We are thus
    reminded that in certain countries plants belonging to the
    generally herbaceous order of the Crucifer&#230; are developed into
    trees. Every one can appreciate the difference between green or red
    cabbages with great single heads; Brussel-sprouts with numerous
    little heads; broccolis and cauliflowers with the greater number of
    their flowers in an aborted condition, incapable of producing seed,
    and borne in a dense corymb instead of an open panicle; savoys with
    their blistered and wrinkled leaves; and borecoles and kails, which
    come nearest to the wild parent-form. There are also various
    frizzled and laciniated kinds, some of such beautiful colours that
    Vilmorin in his Catalogue of 1851 enumerates ten varieties which
    are valued solely for ornament. Some kinds are less commonly known,
    such as the Portuguese Couve Tronchuda, with the ribs of its leaves
    greatly thickened; and the Kohlrabi or choux-raves, with their
    stems enlarged into great turnip-like masses above the ground; and
    the recently formed new race<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> of
    the choux-raves, already including nine sub-varieties, in which the
    enlarged part lies beneath the ground like a turnip.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although we see such great differences in
    the shape, size, colour, arrangement, and manner of growth of the
    leaves and stem, and of the flower-stems in the broccoli and
    cauliflower, it is remarkable that the flowers themselves, the
    seed-pods and seeds, present extremely slight differences or none
    at all.<A href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> I compared the flowers of
    all the principal kinds; those of the Couve Tronchuda are white and
    rather smaller than in common cabbages; those of the Portsmouth
    broccoli have narrower sepals, and smaller, less elongated petals;
    and in no other cabbage could any difference be detected. With
    respect to the seed-pods, in the purple Kohlrabi alone, do they
    differ, being a little longer and narrower than usual. I made a
    collection of the seeds of twenty-eight different kinds, and most
    of them were undistinguishable; when there was any difference it
    was excessively slight; thus, the seeds of various broccolis and
    cauliflowers, when seen in mass, are a little redder; those of the
    early green Ulm savoy are rather smaller; and those of the Breda
    kail slightly larger than usual, but not larger than the seeds of
    the wild cabbage from the coast of Wales. What a contrast in the
    amount of difference is presented if, on the one hand, we compare
    the leaves and stems of the various kinds of cabbage with their
    flowers, pods, and seeds, and on the other hand the corresponding
    parts in the varieties of maize and wheat! The explanation is
    obvious; the seeds alone are valued in our cereals, and their
    variations have been selected; whereas the seeds, seed-pods, and
    flowers, have been utterly neglected in the cabbage, whilst many
    useful variations in their leaves and stems have been noticed and
    preserved from an extremely remote period, for cabbages were
    cultivated by the old Celts.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It would be useless to give a classified

    development of the terminal and lateral leaf-buds. Thus: I. All the
    leaf-buds active and open, as in the wild-cabbage, kail, etc. II.
    All the leaf-buds active, but forming heads, as in Brussel-sprouts,
    etc. III. Terminal leaf-bud alone active, forming a head as in
    common cabbages, savoys, etc. IV. Terminal leaf-bud alone active,
    and open, with most of the flowers abortive and succulent, as in
    the cauliflower and broccoli. V. All the leaf-buds active and open,
    with most of the flowers abortive and succulent, as in the
    sprouting-broccoli. This latter variety is a new one, and bears the
    same relation to common broccoli, as Brussel-sprouts do to common
    cabbages; it suddenly appeared in a bed of common broccoli, and was
    found faithfully to transmit its newly-acquired and remarkable
    characters.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The principal kinds of cabbage existed at
    least as early as the sixteenth century,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> so that numerous modifications of
    structure have been inherited for a long period. This fact is the
    more remarkable as great care must be taken to prevent the crossing
    of the different kinds. To give proof of this: I raised 233
    seedlings from cabbages of different kinds, which had purposely
    been planted near each other, and of the seedlings no less than 155
    were plainly deteriorated and mongrelised; nor were the remaining
    78 all perfectly true. It may be doubted whether many permanent
    varieties have been formed by intentional or accidental crosses;
    for such crossed plants are found to be very inconstant. One kind,
    however, called "Cottager's Kail," has lately been produced by
    crossing common kail and Brussel-sprouts, recrossed with purple
    broccoli,<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> and is said to be true;
    but plants raised by me were not nearly so constant in character as
    any common kind of cabbage.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although most of the kinds keep true if
    carefully preserved from crossing, yet the seed-beds must be yearly
    examined, and a few seedlings are generally found false; but even
    in this case the force of inheritance is shown, for, as Metzger has
    remarked<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> when speaking of
    Brussel-sprouts, the variations generally keep to their "unter
    art," or main race. But in order that any kind may be truly
    propagated there must be no great change in the conditions of life;
    thus cabbages will not form heads in hot countries, and the same
    thing has been observed with an English variety grown during an
    extremely warm and damp autumn near Paris.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> Extremely poor soil also affects the
    characters of certain varieties.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Most authors believe that all the races
    are descended from the wild cabbage found on the western shores of
    Europe; but Alph. De Candolle<A href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A>
    forcibly argues, on historical and other grounds, that it is more
    probable that two or three closely allied forms, generally ranked
    as distinct species, still living in the Mediterranean region, are
    the parents, now all commingled together, of the various cultivated
    kinds. In the same manner as we have often seen with domesticated
    animals, the supposed multiple origin of the cabbage throws no
    light on the characteristic differences between the cultivated
    forms. If our cabbages are the descendants of three or four
    distinct species, every trace of any sterility which may originally
    have existed between them is now lost, for none of the varieties
    can be kept distinct without scrupulous care to prevent
    intercrossing.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The other cultivated forms of the genus
    Brassica are descended, according to the view adopted by Godron and
    Metzger,<A href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> from two species, <I>B.
    napus</I> and <I>rapa</I>; but according to other botanists from
    three species; whilst others again strongly suspect that all these
    forms, both wild and cultivated, ought to be ranked as a single
    species. <I>Brassica napus</I> has given rise to two large groups,
    namely, Swedish turnips (believed to be of hybrid origin)<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> and Colzas, the seeds of which yield
    oil. <I>Brassica rapa</I> (of Koch) has also given rise to two
    races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape. The evidence
    is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so different in
    external appearance, belong to the same species; for the turnip has
    been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in
    uncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they
    cross to such a degree that scarcely a single plant comes true.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> Metzger by culture converted the
    biennial or winter rape into the annual or summer
    rape,&#8212;varieties which have been thought by some authors to be
    specifically distinct.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the production of large, fleshy,
    turnip-like stems, we have a case of analogous variation in three
    forms which are generally considered as distinct species. But
    scarcely any modification seems so easily acquired as a succulent
    enlargement of the stem or root&#8212;that is, a store of nutriment
    laid up for the plant's own future use. We see this in our
    radishes, beet, and in the less generally known "turnip-rooted"
    celery, and in the finocchio, or Italian variety of the common
    fennel. Mr. Buckman has lately proved by his interesting
    experiments bow quickly the roots of the wild parsnip can be
    enlarged, as Vilmorin formerly proved in the case of the carrot.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This latter plant, in its cultivated
    state, differs in scarcely any character from the wild English
    carrot, except in general luxuriance and in the size and quality of
    its roots; but ten varieties, differing in the colour, shape, and
    quality of the root, are cultivated in England and come true by
    seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> Hence with the carrot, as
    in so many other cases, for instance with the numerous varieties
    and sub-varieties of the radish, that part of the plant which is
    valued by man, falsely appears alone to have varied. The truth is
    that variations in this part alone have been selected; and the
    seedlings inheriting a tendency to vary in the same way, analogous
    modifications have been again and again selected, until at last a
    great amount of change has been effected.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the radish, M.
    Carri&#232;re, by sowing the seed of the wild <I>Raphanus
    raphanistrum</I> in rich soil, and by continued selection during
    several generations, raised many varieties, closely like the
    cultivated radish (<I>R. sativus</I>) in their roots, as well as
    the wonderful Chinese variety, <I>R. caudatus</I>: (see 'Journal
    d'Agriculture pratique,' tom. i, 1869, p. 159; also a separate
    essay 'Origine des Plantes Domestiques,' 1869.) <I>Raphanus
    raphanistrum</I> and <I>sativus</I> have often been ranked as
    distinct species, and owing to differences in their fruit even as
    distinct genera; but Professor Hoffman ('Bot. Zeitung,' 1872, p.
    482) has now shown that these differences, remarkable as they are,
    graduate away, the fruit of <I>R. caudatus</I> being intermediate.
    By cultivating <I>R. raphanistrum</I> during several generations
    (ibid., 1873, p. 9), Professor Hoffman also obtained plants bearing
    fruits like those of <I>R. sativus.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Pea (Pisum sativum).</I>&#8212;Most
    botanists look at the garden-pea as specifically distinct from the
    field-pea (<I>P. arvense</I>). The latter exists in a wild state in
    Southern Europe; but the aboriginal parent of the garden-pea has
    been found by one collector alone, as he states, in the Crimea.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> Andrew Knight crossed, as I am
    informed by the Rev. A. Fitch, the field-pea with a well-known
    garden variety, the Prussian pea, and the cross seems to have been
    perfectly fertile. Dr. Alefield has recently studied<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> the genus with care, and, after having
    cultivated about fifty varieties, concludes that certainly they all
    belong to the same species. It is an interesting fact already
    alluded to, that, according to O. Heer,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> the peas found in the lake-habitations
    of Switzerland of the Stone and Bronze ages, belong to an extinct
    variety, with exceedingly small seeds, allied to <I>P. arvense</I>
    or the field-pea. The varieties of the common garden-pea are
    numerous, and differ considerably from one another. For comparison
    I planted at the same time forty-one, English and French varieties.
    They differed greatly in height,&#8212; namely from between 6 and
    12 inches to 8 feet,<A href="#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A>&#8212;in
    manner of growth, and in period of maturity. Some differ in general
    aspect even while only two or three inches in height. The stems of
    the <I>Prussian</I> pea are much branched. The tall kinds have
    larger leaves than the dwarf kinds, but not in strict proportion to
    their height:&#8212;<I>Hair's Dwarf Monmouth</I> has very large
    leaves, and the <I>Pois nain hatif,</I> and the moderately tall <I>
    Blue Prussian,</I> have leaves about two-thirds of the size of the
    tallest kind. In the <I>Danecroft</I> the leaflets are rather small
    and a little pointed; in the <I>Queen of Dwarfs</I> rather rounded;
    and in the <I>Queen of England</I> broad and large. In these three
    peas the slight differences in the shape of the leaves are
    accompanied by slight differences in colour, in the <I>Pois
    g&#233;ant sans parchemin,</I> which bears purple flowers, the
    leaflets in the young plant are edged with red; and in all the peas
    with purple flowers the stipules are marked with red.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the different varieties, one, two, or
    several flowers in a small cluster, are borne on the same peduncle;
    and this is a difference which is considered of specific value in
    some of the Leguminos&#230;. In all the varieties the flowers
    closely resemble each other except in colour and size. They are
    generally white, sometimes purple, but the colour is inconstant
    even in the same variety. In <I>Warner's Emperor,</I> which is a
    tall kind, the flowers are nearly double the size of the <I>Pois
    nain hatif</I>; but <I>Hair's Dwarf Monmouth,</I> which has large
    leaves, likewise has large flowers. The calyx in the <I>Victoria
    Marrow</I> is large, and in <I>Bishop's Long Pod</I> the sepals are
    rather narrow. In no other kind is there any difference in the
    flower.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The pods and seeds, which with natural
    species afford such constant characters, differ greatly in the
    cultivated varieties of the pea; and these are the valuable, and
    consequently the selected parts. <I>Sugar peas,</I> or <I>P</I>,
    are remarkable from their thin pods, which, whilst young, are
    cooked and eaten whole; and in this group, which, according to Mr.
    Gordon includes eleven sub-varieties, it is the pod which differs
    most; thus <I>Lewis's Negro-podded pea</I> has a straight, broad,
    smooth, and dark-purple pod, with the husk not so thin as in the
    other kinds; the pod of another variety is extremely bowed; that of
    the <I>Pois g&#233;ant</I> is much pointed at the extremity; and in
    the variety "&#224; grands cosses" the peas are seen through the
    husk in so conspicuous a manner that the pod, especially when dry,
    can hardly at first be recognised as that of a pea.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the ordinary varieties the pods also
    differ much in size;&#8212;in colour, that of <I>Woodford's Green
    Marrow</I> being bright-green when dry, instead of pale brown, and
    that of the purple-podded pea being expressed by its name;&#8212;in
    smoothness, that of <I>Danecroft</I> being remarkably glossy,
    whereas that of the <I>Ne plus ultra</I> is rugged; in being either
    nearly cylindrical, or broad and flat;&#8212;in being pointed at
    the end, as in <I>Thurston's Reliance,</I> or much truncated, as in
    the <I>American Dwarf.</I> In the <I>Auvergne pea</I> the whole end
    of the pod is bowed upwards. In the <I>Queen of the Dwarfs</I> and
    in <I>Scimitar peas</I> the pod is almost elliptic in shape. I here
    give drawings of the four most distinct pods produced by the plants
    cultivated by me.</SMALL></P>

    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the pea itself we have every tint
    between almost pure white, brown, yellow, and intense green; in the
    varieties of the <I>Sugar peas</I> we have these same tints,
    together with red passing through fine purple into a dark chocolate
    tint. These colours are either uniform or distributed in dots,
    stri&#230;, or moss-like marks; they depend in some cases on the
    colour of the cotyledons seen through the skin, and in other cases
    on the outer coats of the pea itself. In the different varieties,
    the pods contain, according to Mr. Gordon, from eleven or twelve to
    only four or five peas. The largest peas are nearly twice as much
    in diameter as the smallest; and the latter are not always borne by
    the most dwarfed kinds. Peas differ much in shape, being smooth and
    spherical, smooth and oblong, nearly oval in the <I>Queen of the
    Dwarfs,</I> and nearly cubical and crumpled in many of the larger
    kinds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the value of the
    differences between the chief varieties, it cannot be doubted that,
    if one of the tall <I>Sugar-peas,</I> with purple flowers,
    thin-skinned pods of an extraordinary shape, including large,
    dark-purple peas, grew wild by the side of the lowly <I>Queen of
    the Dwarfs,</I> with white flowers, greyish-green, rounded leaves,
    scimitar-like pods, containing oblong, smooth, pale-coloured peas,
    which became mature at a different season: or by the side of one of
    the gigantic sorts, like the <I>Champion of England,</I> with
    leaves of great size, pointed pods, and large, green, crumpled,
    almost cubical peas,&#8212;all three kinds would be ranked as
    distinct species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Andrew Knight<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> has observed that the varieties of peas
    keep very true, because they are not crossed by insects. As far as
    the fact of keeping true is concerned, I hear from Mr. Masters of
    Canterbury, well known as the originator of several new kinds, that
    certain varieties have remained constant for a considerable
    time,&#8212;for instance, <I>Knight's Blue Dwarf,</I> which came
    out about the year 1820.<A href="#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> But the
    greater number of varieties have a singularly short existence: thus
    Loudon remarks<A href="#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A> that "sorts which
    were highly approved in 1821, are now, in 1833, nowhere to be
    found;" and on comparing the lists of 1833 with those of 1855, I
    find that nearly all the varieties have changed. Mr. Masters
    informs me that the nature of the soil causes some varieties to
    lose their character. As with other plants, certain varieties can
    be propagated truly, whilst others show a determined tendency to
    vary; thus two peas differing in shape, one round and the other
    wrinkled, were found by Mr. Masters within the same pod, but the
    plants raised from the wrinkled kind always evinced a strong
    tendency to produce round peas. Mr. Masters also raised from a
    plant of another variety four distinct sub-varieties, which bore
    blue and round, white and round, blue and wrinkled, and white and
    wrinkled peas; and although he sowed these four varieties
    separately during several successive years, each kind always
    reproduced all four kinds mixed together!</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the varieties not
    naturally intercrossing, I have ascertained that the pea, which in
    this respect differs from some other Leguminos&#230;, is perfectly
    fertile without the aid of insects. Yet I have seen humble-bees
    whilst sucking the nectar depress the keel-petals, and become so
    thickly dusted with pollen, that it could hardly fail to be left on
    the stigma of the next flower which was visited. Nevertheless,
    distinct varieties growing closely together rarely cross; and I
    have reason to believe that this is due to their stigmas being
    prematurely fertilised in this country by pollen from the same
    flower. The horticulturists who raise seed-peas are thus enabled to
    plant distinct varieties close together without any bad
    consequences; and it is certain, as I have myself found, that true
    seed may be saved during at least several generations under these
    circumstances.<A href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A> Mr. Fitch raised,
    as he informs me, one variety for twenty years, and it always came
    true, though grown close to other varieties. From the analogy of
    kidney-beans I should have expected<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> that varieties thus circumstanced would
    have occasionally crossed; and I shall give in the eleventh chapter
    two cases of this having occurred, as shown (in a manner hereafter
    to be explained) by the pollen of the one variety having acted
    directly on the seeds of the other. Whether many of the new
    varieties which incessantly appear are due to such occasional and
    accidental crosses, I do not know. Nor do I know whether the short
    existence of almost all the numerous varieties is the result of
    mere change of fashion, or of their having a weak constitution,
    from being the product of long-continued self-fertilisation. It
    may, however, be noticed that several of Andrew Knight's varieties,
    which have endured longer than most kinds, were raised towards the
    close of the last century by artificial crosses; some of them, I
    believe, were still vigorous in 1860; but now, in 1865, a writer,
    speaking<A href="#refer"><SUP>90</SUP></A> of Knight's four kinds
    of marrows, says, they have acquired a famous history, but their
    glory has departed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to Beans (<I>Faba
    vulgaris</I>), I will say but little. Dr. Alefield has given<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> short diagnostic characters of
    forty varieties. Everyone who has seen a collection must have been
    struck with the great difference in shape, thickness, proportional
    length and breadth, colour, and size which beans present. What a
    contrast between a Windsor and Horse-bean! As in the case of the
    pea, our existing varieties were preceded during the Bronze age in
    Switzerland<A href="#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> by a peculiar and now
    extinct variety producing very small beans.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Potato (Solanum
    tuberosum).</I>&#8212;There is little doubt about the parentage of
    this plant; for the cultivated varieties differ extremely little in
    general appearance from the wild species, which can be recognised
    in its native land at the first glance.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>94</SUP></A> The varieties cultivated in Britain are
    numerous; thus Lawson<A href="#refer"><SUP>95</SUP></A> gives a
    description of 175 kinds. I planted eighteen kinds in adjoining
    rows; their stems and leaves differed but little, and in several
    cases there was as great a difference between the individuals of
    the same variety as between the different varieties. The flower
    varied in size, and in colour between white and purple, but in no
    other respect, except that in one kind the sepals were somewhat
    elongated. One strange variety has been described which always
    produces two sorts of flowers, the first double and sterile, the
    second single and fertile.<A href="#refer"><SUP>96</SUP></A> The
    fruit or berries also differ, but only in a slight degree.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>97</SUP></A> The varieties are liable in very
    different degree to the attack of the Colorado potato-beetle.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>98</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The tubers, on the other hand, present a
    wonderful amount of diversity. This fact accords with the principle
    that the valuable and selected parts of all cultivated productions
    present the greatest amount of modification. They differ much in
    size and shape, being globular, oval, flattened, kidney-like, or
    cylindrical. One variety from Peru is described<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>99</SUP></A> as being quite straight, and at least
    six inches in length, though no thicker than a man's finger. The
    eyes or buds differ in form, position, and colour. The manner in
    which the tubers are arranged on the so-called roots or rhizomes is
    different; thus, in the <I>gurken-kartoffeln</I> they form a
    pyramid with the apex downwards, and in another variety they bury
    themselves deep in the ground. The roots themselves run either near
    the surface or deep in the ground. The tubers also differ in
    smoothness and colour, being externally white, red, purple, or
    almost black, and internally white, yellow, or almost black. They
    differ in flavour and quality, being either waxy or mealy; in their
    period of maturity, and in their capacity for long
    preservation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As with many other plants which have been
    long propagated by bulbs, tubers, cuttings, etc., by which means
    the same individual is exposed during a length of time to
    diversified conditions, seedling potatoes generally display
    innumerable slight differences. Several varieties, even when
    propagated by tubers, are far from constant, as will be seen in the
    chapter on Bud-variation. Dr. Anderson<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>100</SUP></A> procured seed from an Irish purple
    potato, which grew far from any other kind, so that it could not at
    least in this generation have been crossed, yet the many seedlings
    varied in almost every possible respect, so that "scarcely two
    plants were exactly alike." Some of the plants which closely
    resembled each other above ground, produced extremely dissimilar
    tubers; and some tubers which externally could hardly be
    distinguished, differed widely in quality when cooked. Even in this
    case of extreme variability, the parent-stock had some influence on
    the progeny, for the greater number of the seedlings resembled in
    some degree the parent Irish potato. Kidney potatoes must be ranked
    amongst the most highly cultivated and artificial races;
    nevertheless their peculiarities can often be strictly propagated
    by seed. A great authority, Mr. Rivers,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>101</SUP></A> states that "seedlings from the
    ash-leaved kidney always bear a strong resemblance to their parent.
    Seedlings from the fluke-kidney are still more remarkable for their
    adherence to their parent stock, for, on closely observing a great
    number during two seasons, I have not been able to observe the
    least difference, either in earliness, productiveness, or in the
    size or shape of their tubers."</SMALL></P>
