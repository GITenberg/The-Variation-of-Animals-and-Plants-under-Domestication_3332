    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Natural Selection, or the Survival of the
    Fittest, as affecting domestic productions.</I>&#8212;We know
    little on this head. But as animals kept by savages have to provide
    throughout the year their own food either entirely or to a large
    extent, it can hardly be doubted that in different countries,
    varieties differing in constitution and in various characters would
    succeed best, and so be naturally selected. Hence perhaps it is
    that the few domesticated animals kept by savages partake, as has
    been remarked by more than one writer, of the wild appearance of
    their masters, and likewise resemble natural species. Even in
    long-civilised countries, at least in the wilder parts, natural
    selection must act on our domestic races. It is obvious that
    varieties having very different habits, constitution, and
    structure, would succeed best on mountains and on rich lowland
    pastures. For example, the improved Leicester sheep were formerly
    taken to the Lammermuir Hills; but an intelligent sheep-master
    reported that "our coarse lean pastures were unequal to the task of
    supporting such heavy-bodied sheep; and they gradually dwindled
    away into less and less bulk: each generation was inferior to the
    preceding one; and when the spring was severe, seldom more than
    two-thirds of the lambs survived the ravages of the storms."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> So with the mountain cattle of North
    Wales and the Hebrides, it has been found that they could not
    withstand being crossed with the larger and more delicate lowland
    breeds. Two French naturalists, in describing the horses of
    Circassia, remark that, subjected as they are to extreme
    vicissitudes of climate, having to search for scanty pasture, and
    exposed to constant danger from wolves, the strongest and most
    vigorous alone survive.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Every one must have been struck with the
    surpassing grace, strength, and vigour of the Game-cock, with its
    bold and confident air, its long, yet firm neck, compact body,
    powerful and closely pressed wings, muscular thighs, strong beak
    massive at the base, dense and sharp spurs set low on the legs for
    delivering the fatal blow, and its compact, glossy, and mail-like
    plumage serving as a defence. Now the English game-cock has not
    only been improved during many years by man's careful selection,
    but in addition, as Mr. Tegetmeier has remarked, by a kind of
    natural selection, for the strongest, most active and courageous
    birds have stricken down their antagonists in the cockpit,
    generation after generation, and have subsequently served as the
    progenitors of their race. The same kind of double selection has
    come into play with the carrier pigeon, for during their training
    the inferior birds fail to return home and are lost, so that even
    without selection by man only the superior birds propagate their
    race.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In Great Britain, in former times, almost every
    district had its own breed of cattle and sheep; "they were
    indigenous to the soil, climate, and pasturage of the locality on
    which they grazed: they seemed to have been formed for it and by
    it."<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> But in this case we are quite
    unable to disentangle the effects of the direct action of the
    conditions of life,&#8212;of use or habit&#8212;of natural
    selection&#8212;and of that kind of selection which we have seen is
    occasionally and unconsciously followed by man even during the
    rudest periods of history.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Let us now look to the action of natural
    selection on special characters. Although nature is difficult to
    resist, yet man often strives against her power, and sometimes with
    success. From the facts to be given, it will also be seen that
    natural selection would powerfully affect many of our domestic
    productions if left unprotected. This is a point of much interest,
    for we thus learn that differences apparently of very slight
    importance would certainly determine the survival of a form when
    forced to struggle for its own existence. It may have occurred to
    some naturalists, as it formerly did to me, that, though selection
    acting under natural conditions would determine the structure of
    all important organs, yet that it could not affect characters which
    are esteemed by us of little importance; but this is an error to
    which we are eminently liable, from our ignorance of what
    characters are of real value to each living creature.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When man attempts to make a breed with some
    serious defect in structure, or in the mutual relation of the
    several parts, he will partly or completely fail, or encounter much
    difficulty; he is in fact resisted by a form of natural selection.
    We have seen that an attempt was once made in Yorkshire to breed
    cattle with enormous buttocks, but the cows perished so often in
    bringing forth their calves, that the attempt had to be given up.
    In rearing short-faced tumblers, Mr. Eaton says,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> "I am convinced that better head and beak
    birds have perished in the shell than ever were hatched; the reason
    being that the amazingly short-faced bird cannot reach and break
    the shell with its beak, and so perishes." Here is a more curious
    case, in which natural selection comes into play only at long
    intervals of time: during ordinary seasons the Niata cattle can
    graze as well as others, but occasionally, as from 1827 to 1830 the
    plains of La Plata suffer from long-continued droughts and the
    pasture is burnt up; at such times common cattle and horses perish
    by the thousand, but many survive by browsing on twigs, reeds,
    etc.; this the Niata cattle cannot so well effect from their
    upturned jaws and the shape of their lips; consequently, if not
    attended to, they perish before the other cattle. In Columbia,
    according to Roulin, there is a breed of nearly hairless cattle,
    called Pelones; these succeed in their native hot district, but are
    found too tender for the Cordillera; in this case, however, natural
    selection determines only the range of the variety. It is obvious
    that a host of artificial races could never survive in a state of
    nature;&#8212;such as Italian greyhounds,&#8212;hairless and almost
    toothless Turkish dogs,&#8212;fantail pigeons, which cannot fly
    well against a strong wind,&#8212;barbs and Polish fowls, with
    their vision impeded by their eye wattles and great
    topknots,&#8212;hornless bulls and rams, which consequently cannot
    cope with other males, and thus have a poor chance of leaving
    offspring,&#8212;seedless plants, and many other such cases.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Colour is generally esteemed by the systematic
    naturalist as unimportant: let us, therefore, see how far it
    indirectly affects our domestic productions, and how far it would
    affect them if they were left exposed to the full force of natural
    selection. In a future chapter I shall have to show that
    constitutional peculiarities of the strangest kind, entailing
    liability to the action of certain poisons, are correlated with the
    colour of the skin. I will here give a single case, on the high
    authority of Professor Wyman; he informs me that, being surprised
    at all the pigs in a part of Virginia being black, he made
    inquiries, and ascertained that these animals feed on the roots of
    the <I>Lachnanthes tinctoria,</I> which colours their bones pink,
    and, excepting in the case of the black varieties, causes the hoofs
    to drop off. Hence, as one of the squatters remarked, "we select
    the black members of the litter for raising, as they alone have a
    good chance of living." So that here we have artificial and natural
    selection working hand in hand. I may add that in the Tarentino the
    inhabitants keep black sheep alone, because the <I>Hypericum
    crispum</I> abounds there; and this plant does not injure black
    sheep, but kills the white ones in about a fortnight's time.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Complexion, and liability to certain diseases,
    are believed to run together in man and the lower animals. Thus
    white terriers suffer more than those of any other colour from the
    fatal distemper.<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> In North America
    plum-trees are liable to a disease which Downing<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> believes is not caused by insects; the
    kinds bearing purple fruit are most affected, "and we have never
    known the green or yellow fruited varieties infected until the
    other sorts had first become filled with the knots." On the other
    hand, peaches in North America suffer much from a disease called
    the <I>yellows,</I> which seems to be peculiar to that continent,
    and more than nine-tenths of the victims, "when the disease first
    appeared, were the yellow-fleshed peaches. The white-fleshed kinds
    are much more rarely attacked; in some parts of the country never."
    In Mauritius, the white sugar-canes have of late years been so
    severely attacked by a disease, that many planters have been
    compelled to give up growing this variety (although fresh plants
    were imported from China for trial), and cultivate only red
    canes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Now, if these plants had
    been forced to struggle with other competing plants and enemies,
    there cannot be a doubt that the colour of the flesh or skin of the
    fruit, unimportant as these characters are considered, would have
    rigorously determined their existence.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Liability to the attacks of parasites is also
    connected with colour. White chickens are certainly more subject
    than dark-coloured chickens to the "gapes," which is caused by a
    parasitic worm in the trachea.<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> On
    the other hand, experience has shown that in France the
    caterpillars which produce white cocoons resist the deadly fungus
    better than those producing yellow cocoons.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Analogous facts have been observed with
    plants: a new and beautiful white onion, imported from France,
    though planted close to other kinds, was alone attacked by a
    parasitic fungus.<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> White verbenas
    are especially liable to mildew.<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
    Near Malaga, during an early period of the vine-disease, the green
    sorts suffered most; "and red and black grapes, even when
    interwoven with the sick plants, suffered not at all." In France
    whole groups of varieties were comparatively free, and others, such
    as the Chasselas, did not afford a single fortunate exception; but
    I do not know whether any correlation between colour and liability
    to disease was here observed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> In
    a former chapter it was shown how curiously liable one variety of
    the strawberry is to mildew.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is certain that insects regulate in many
    cases the range and even the existence of the higher animals,
    whilst living under their natural conditions. Under domestication
    light-coloured animals suffer most: in Thuringia<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> the inhabitants do not like grey, white,
    or pale cattle, because they are much more troubled by various
    kinds of flies than the brown, red, or black cattle. An Albino
    negro, it has been remarked,<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> was
    peculiarly sensitive to the bites of insects. In the West Indies<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> it is said that "the only horned
    cattle fit for work are those which have a good deal of black in
    them. The white are terribly tormented by the insects; and they are
    weak and sluggish in proportion to the white."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In Devonshire there is a prejudice against white
    pigs, because it is believed that the sun blisters them when turned
    out;<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> and I knew a man who would
    not keep white pigs in Kent, for the same reason. The scorching of
    flowers by the sun seems likewise to depend much on colour; thus,
    dark pelargoniums suffer most; and from various accounts it is
    clear that the cloth-of-gold variety will not withstand a degree of
    exposure to sunshine which other varieties enjoy. Another amateur
    asserts that not only all dark-coloured verbenas, but likewise
    scarlets, suffer from the sun: "the paler kinds stand better, and
    pale blue is perhaps the best of all." So again with the heartsease
    (<I>Viola tricolor</I>); hot weather suits the blotched sorts,
    whilst it destroys the beautiful markings of some other kinds.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> During one extremely cold season in
    Holland all red-flowered hyacinths were observed to be very
    inferior in quality. It is believed by many agriculturists that red
    wheat is hardier in northern climates than white wheat.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With animals, white varieties from being
    conspicuous are the most liable to be attacked by beasts and birds
    of prey. In parts of France and Germany where hawks abound, persons
    are advised not to keep white pigeons; for, as Parmentier says, "it
    is certain that in a flock the white always first fall victims to
    the kite." In Belgium, where so many societies have been
    established for the flight of carrier-pigeons, white is the one
    colour which for the same reason is disliked.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> Prof. G. Jaeger<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> whilst fishing found four pigeons which
    had been killed by hawks, and all were white; on another occasion
    he examined the eyrie of a hawk, and the feathers of the pigeons
    which had been caught were all of a white or yellow colour. On the
    other hand, it is said that the sea-eagle (<I>Falco ossifragus,</I>
    Linn.) on the west coast of Ireland picks out the black fowls, so
    that "the villagers avoid as much as possible rearing birds of that
    colour." M. Daudin,<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> speaking of
    white rabbits kept in warrens in Russia, remarks that their colour
    is a great disadvantage, as they are thus more exposed to attack,
    and can be seen during bright nights from a distance. A gentleman
    in Kent, who failed to stock his woods with a nearly white and
    hardy kind of rabbit, accounted in the same manner for their early
    disappearance. Any one who will watch a white cat prowling after
    her prey will soon perceive under what a disadvantage she lies.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The white Tartarian cherry, "owing either to its
    colour being so much like that of the leaves, or to the fruit
    always appearing from a distance unripe," is not so readily
    attacked by birds as other sorts. The yellow-fruited raspberry,
    which generally comes nearly true by seed, "is very little molested
    by birds, who evidently are not fond of it; so that nets may be
    dispensed with in places where nothing else will protect the red
    fruit."<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> This immunity, though a
    benefit to the gardener, would be a disadvantage in a state of
    nature both to the cherry and raspberry, as dissemination depends
    on birds. I noticed during several winters that some trees of the
    yellow-berried holly, which were raised from seed from a tree found
    wild by my father remained covered with fruit, whilst not a scarlet
    berry could be seen on the adjoining trees of the common kind. A
    friend informs me that a mountain-ash (<I>Pyrus aucuparia</I>)
    growing in his garden bears berries which, though not differently
    coloured, are always devoured by birds before those on the other
    trees. This variety of the mountain-ash would thus be more freely
    disseminated, and the yellow-berried variety of the holly less
    freely, than the common varieties of these two trees.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Independently of colour, trifling differences
    are sometimes found to be of importance to plants under
    cultivation, and would be of paramount importance if they had to
    fight their own battle and to struggle with many competitors. The
    thin-shelled peas, called <I>pois sans parchemin,</I> are attacked
    by birds<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> much more commonly than
    ordinary peas. On the other hand, the purple-podded pea, which has
    a hard shell, escaped the attacks of tomtits (<I>Parus major</I>)
    in my garden far better than any other kind. The thin-shelled
    walnut likewise suffers greatly from the tomtit.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> These same birds have been observed to
    pass over and thus favour the filbert, destroying only the other
    kinds of nuts which grew in the same orchard.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Certain varieties of the pear have soft bark,
    and these suffer severely from wood-boring beetles; whilst other
    varieties are known to resist their attacks much better.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> In North America the smoothness, or
    absence of down on the fruit, makes a great difference in the
    attacks of the weevil, "which is the uncompromising foe of all
    smooth stone-fruits;" and the cultivator "has the frequent
    mortification of seeing nearly all, or indeed often the whole crop,
    fall from the trees when half or two-thirds grown." Hence the
    nectarine suffers more than the peach. A particular variety of the
    Morello cherry, raised in North America, is, without any assignable
    cause, more liable to be injured by this same insect than other
    cherry-trees.<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> From some unknown
    cause, certain varieties of the apple enjoy, as we have seen, the
    great advantage in various parts of the world of not being infested
    by the coccus. On the other hand, a particular case has been
    recorded in which aphides confined themselves to the Winter Nelis
    pear and touched no other kind in an extensive orchard.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> The existence of minute glands on the
    leaves of peaches, nectarines, and apricots, would not be esteemed
    by botanists as a character of the least importance for they are
    present or absent in closely-related sub-varieties, descended from
    the same parent-tree; yet there is good evidence<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> that the absence of glands leads to
    mildew, which is highly injurious to these trees.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A difference either in flavour or in the amount
    of nutriment in certain varieties causes them to be more eagerly
    attacked by various enemies than other varieties of the same
    species. Bullfinches (<I>Pyrrhula vulgaris</I>) injure our
    fruit-trees by devouring the flower-buds, and a pair of these birds
    have been seen "to denude a large plum-tree in a couple of days of
    almost every bud;" but certain varieties<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> of the apple and thorn (<I>Crat&#230;gus
    oxyacantha</I>) are more especially liable to be attacked. A
    striking instance of this was observed in Mr. Rivers's garden, in
    which two rows of a particular variety of plum<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> had to be carefully protected, as they
    were usually stripped of all their buds during the winter, whilst
    other sorts growing near them escaped. The root (or enlarged stem)
    of Laing's Swedish turnip is preferred by hares, and therefore
    suffers more than other varieties. Hares and rabbits eat down
    common rye before St. John's-day-rye, when both grow together.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> In the south of France, when an
    orchard of almond-trees is formed, the nuts of the bitter variety
    are sown, "in order that they may not be devoured by field-mice";<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> so we see the use of the bitter
    principle in almonds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Other slight differences, which would be thought
    quite unimportant, are no doubt sometimes of great service both to
    plants and animals. The Whitesmith's gooseberry, as formerly
    stated, produces its leaves later than other varieties, and, as the
    flowers are thus left unprotected, the fruit often fails. In one
    variety of the cherry, according to Mr. Rivers,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> the petals are much curled backwards,
    and in consequence of this the stigmas were observed to be killed
    by a severe frost; whilst at the same time, in another variety with
    incurved petals, the stigmas were not in the least injured. The
    straw of the Fenton wheat is remarkably unequal in height; and a
    competent observer believes that this variety is highly productive,
    partly because the ears from being distributed at various heights
    above the ground are less crowded together. The same observer
    maintains that in the upright varieties the divergent awns are
    serviceable by breaking the shocks when the ears are dashed
    together by the wind.<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> If several
    varieties of a plant are grown together, and the seed is
    indiscriminately harvested, it is clear that the hardier and more
    productive kinds will, by a sort of natural selection, gradually
    prevail over the others; this takes place, as Colonel Le Couteur
    believes,<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> in our wheat-fields,
    for, as formerly shown, no variety is quite uniform in character.
    The same thing, as I am assured by nurserymen, would take place in
    our flower-gardens, if the seed of the different varieties were not
    separately saved. When the eggs of the wild and tame duck are
    hatched together, the young wild ducks almost invariably perish,
    from being of smaller size and not getting their fair share of
    food.<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Facts in sufficient number have now been given
    showing that natural selection often checks, but occasionally
    favours, man's power of selection. These facts teach us, in
    addition, a valuable lesson, namely, that we ought to be extremely
    cautious in judging what characters are of importance in a state of
    nature to animals and plants, which have to struggle for existence
    from the hour of their birth to that of their death,&#8212;their
    existence depending on conditions, about which we are profoundly
    ignorant.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Circumstances favourable to Selection by Man.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The possibility of selection rests on
    variability, and this, as we shall see in the following chapters,
    mainly depends on changed conditions of life, but is governed by
    infinitely complex and unknown laws. Domestication, even when long
    continued, occasionally causes but a small amount of variability,
    as in the case of the goose and turkey. The slight differences,
    however, which characterise each individual animal and plant would
    in most, probably in all, cases suffice for the production of
    distinct races through careful and prolonged selection. We see what
    selection, though acting on mere individual differences, can effect
    when families of cattle, sheep, pigeons, etc., of the same race,
    have been separately bred during a number of years by different men
    without any wish on their part to modify the breed. We see the same
    fact in the difference between hounds bred for hunting in different
    districts,<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> and in many other such
    cases.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In order that selection should produce any
    result, it is manifest that the crossing of distinct races must be
    prevented; hence facility in pairing, as with the pigeon, is highly
    favourable for the work; and difficulty in pairing, as with cats,
    prevents the formation of distinct breeds. On nearly the same
    principle the cattle of the small island of Jersey have been
    improved in their milking qualities "with a rapidity that could not
    have been obtained in a widely extended country like France."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Although free crossing is a danger
    on the one side which every one can see, too close interbreeding is
    a hidden danger on the other side. Unfavourable conditions of life
    overrule the power of selection. Our improved heavy breeds of
    cattle and sheep could not have been formed on mountainous
    pastures; nor could dray-horses have been raised on a barren and
    inhospitable land, such as the Falkland Islands, where even the
    light horses of La Plata rapidly decrease in size. It seems
    impossible to preserve several English breeds of sheep in France;
    for as soon as the lambs are weaned their vigour decays as the heat
    of the summer increases:<A href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> it would
    be impossible to give great length of wool to sheep within the
    tropics; yet selection has kept the Merino breed nearly true under
    diversified and unfavourable conditions. The power of selection is
    so great, that breeds of the dog, sheep, and poultry, of the
    largest and smallest size, long and short beaked pigeons, and other
    breeds with opposite characters, have had their characteristic
    qualities augmented, though treated in every way alike, being
    exposed to the same climate and fed on the same food. Selection,
    however, is either checked or favoured by the effects of use or
    habit. Our wonderfully-improved pigs could never have been formed
    if they had been forced to search for their own food; the English
    racehorse and greyhound could not have been improved up to their
    present high standard of excellence without constant training.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As conspicuous deviations of structure occur
    rarely, the improvement of each breed is generally the result of
    the selection of slight individual differences. Hence the closest
    attention, the sharpest powers of observation, and indomitable
    perseverance, are indispensable. It is, also, highly important that
    many individuals of the breed which is to be improved should be
    raised; for thus there will be a better chance of the appearance of
    variations in the right direction, and individuals varying in an
    unfavourable manner may be freely rejected or destroyed. But that a
    large number of individuals should be raised, it is necessary that
    the conditions of life should favour the propagation of the
    species. Had the peacock been reared as easily as the fowl, we
    should probably ere this have had many distinct races. We see the
    importance of a large number of plants, from the fact of nursery
    gardeners almost always beating amateurs in the exhibition of new
    varieties. In 1845 it was estimated<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> that between 4000 and 5000 pelargoniums
    were annually raised from seed in England, yet a decidedly improved
    variety is rarely obtained. At Messrs. Carter's grounds, in Essex,
    where such flowers as the Lobelia, Nemophila, Mignonette, etc., are
    grown by the acre for seed, "scarcely a season passes without some
    new kinds being raised, or some improvement effected on old
    kinds."<A href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> At Kew, as Mr. Beaton
    remarks, where many seedlings of common plants are raised, "you see
    new forms of Laburnums, Spiraeas, and other shrubs."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> So with animals: Marshall,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> in speaking of the sheep in one part of
    Yorkshire, remarks, "as they belong to poor people, and are mostly
    in small lots, they never can be improved." Lord Rivers, when asked
    how he succeeded in always having first-rate greyhounds, answered,
    "I breed many, and hang many." This, as another man remarks, "was
    the secret of his success; and the same will be found in exhibiting
    fowls,&#8212; successful competitors breed largely, and keep the
    best."<A href="#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It follows from this that the capacity of
    breeding at an early age and at short intervals, as with pigeons,
    rabbits, etc., facilitates selection; for the result is thus soon
    made visible, and perseverance in the work encouraged. It can
    hardly be an accident that the great majority of the culinary and
    agricultural plants which have yielded numerous races are annuals
    or biennials, which therefore are capable of rapid propagation, and
    thus of improvement. Sea-kale, asparagus, common and Jerusalem
    artichokes, potatoes, and onions, must be excepted, as they are
    perennials: but onions are propagated like annuals, and of the
    other plants just specified, none, with the exception of the
    potato, have yielded in this country more than one or two
    varieties. In the Mediterranean region, where artichokes are often
    raised from seed, there are several kinds, as I hear from Mr.
    Bentham. No doubt fruit-trees, which cannot be propagated quickly
    by seed, have yielded a host of varieties, though not permanent
    races; but these, judging from prehistoric remains, have been
    produced at a comparatively late period.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A species may be highly variable, but distinct
    races will not be formed, if from any cause selection be not
    applied. It would be difficult to select slight variations in
    fishes from their place of habitation; and though the carp is
    extremely variable and is much attended to in Germany, only one
    well-marked race has been formed, as I hear from Lord A. Russell,
    namely the <I>spiegel-carpe</I>; and this is carefully secluded
    from the common scaly kind. On the other hand, a closely allied
    species, the gold-fish, from being reared in small vessels, and
    from having been carefully attended to by the Chinese, has yielded
    many races. Neither the bee, which has been semi-domesticated from
    an extremely remote period, nor the cochineal insect, which was
    cultivated by the aboriginal Mexicans,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> has yielded races; and it would be
    impossible to match the queen-bee with any particular drone, and
    most difficult to match cochineal insects. Silk-moths, on the other
    hand, have been subjected to rigorous selection, and have produced
    a host of races. Cats, which from their nocturnal habits cannot be
    selected for breeding, do not, as formerly remarked, yield distinct
    races within the same country. Dogs are held in abomination in the
    East, and their breeding is neglected; consequently, as Prof.
    Moritz Wagner<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> remarks, one kind
    alone exists there. The ass in England varies much in colour and
    size; but as it is an animal of little value and bred by poor
    people, there has been no selection, and distinct races have not
    been formed. We must not attribute the inferiority of our asses to
    climate, for in India they are of even smaller size than in Europe.
    But when selection is brought to bear on the ass, all is changed.
    Near Cordova, as I am informed (Feb. 1860) by Mr. W. E. Webb,
    <SMALL>C.E.</SMALL>, they are carefully bred, as much as
    200<I>l.</I> having been paid for a stallion ass, and they have
    been immensely improved. In Kentucky, asses have been imported (for
    breeding mules) from Spain, Malta, and France; these "seldom
    averaged more than fourteen hands high: but the Kentuckians, by
    great care, have raised them up to fifteen hands, and sometimes
    even to sixteen. The prices paid for these splendid animals, for
    such they really are, will prove how much they are in request. One
    male, of great celebrity, was sold for upwards of one thousand
    pounds sterling." These choice asses are sent to cattle-shows, a
    day being given for their exhibition.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Analogous facts have been observed with plants:
    the nutmeg-tree in the Malay archipelago is highly variable, but
    there has been no selection, and there are no distinct races.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> The common mignonette (<I>Reseda
    odorata</I>), from bearing inconspicuous flowers, valued solely for
    their fragrance, "remains in the same unimproved condition as when
    first introduced."<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> Our common
    forest-trees are very variable, as may be seen in every extensive
    nursery-ground; but as they are not valued like fruit-trees, and as
    they seed late in life, no selection has been applied to them;
    consequently, as Mr. Patrick Matthews remarks,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> they have not yielded distinct races,
    leafing at different periods, growing to different sizes, and
    producing timber fit for different purposes. We have gained only
    some fanciful and semi-monstrous varieties, which no doubt appeared
    suddenly as we now see them.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some botanists have argued that plants cannot
    have so strong a tendency to vary as is generally supposed, because
    many species long grown in botanic gardens, or unintentionally
    cultivated year after year mingled with our corn crops, have not
    produced distinct races; but this is accounted for by slight
    variations not having been selected and propagated. Let a plant
    which is now grown in a botanic garden, or any common weed, be
    cultivated on a large scale, and let a sharp-sighted gardener look
    out for each slight variety and sow the seed, and then, if distinct
    races are not produced, the argument will be valid.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The importance of selection is likewise shown by
    considering special characters. For instance, with most breeds of
    fowls the form of the comb and the colour of the plumage have been
    attended to, and are eminently characteristic of each race; but in
    Dorkings fashion has never demanded uniformity of comb or colour;
    and the utmost diversity in these respects prevails. Rose-combs,
    double-combs, cup-combs, etc., and colours of all kinds, may be
    seen in purely bred and closely related Dorking fowls, whilst other
    points, such as the general form of body, and the presence of an
    additional toe, have been attended to, and are invariably present.
    It has also been ascertained that colour can be fixed in this
    breed, as well as in any other.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">During the formation or improvement of a breed,
    its members will always be found to vary much in those characters
    to which especial attention is directed, and of which each slight
    improvement is eagerly sought and selected. Thus, with short-faced
    tumbler-pigeons, the shortness of the beak, shape of head and
    plumage,&#8212;with carriers, the length of the beak and
    wattle,&#8212;with fantails, the tail and carriage,&#8212;with
    Spanish fowls, the white face and comb,&#8212;with long-eared
    rabbits, the length of ear, are all points which are eminently
    variable. So it is in every case; and the large price paid for
    first-rate animals proves the difficulty of breeding them up to the
    highest standard of excellence. This subject has been discussed by
    fanciers,<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> and the greater prizes
    given for highly improved breeds, in comparison with those given
    for old breeds which are not now undergoing rapid improvement, have
    been fully justified. Nathusius makes<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> a similar remark when discussing the
    less uniform character of improved Shorthorn cattle and of the
    English horse, in comparison, for example, with the unennobled
    cattle of Hungary, or with the horses of the Asiatic steppes. This
    want of uniformity in the parts which at the time are undergoing
    selection chiefly depends on the strength of the principle of
    reversion; but it likewise depends to a certain extent on the
    continued variability of the parts which have recently varied. That
    the same parts do continue varying in the same manner we must
    admit, for if it were not so, there could be no improvement beyond
    an early standard of excellence, and we know that such improvement
    is not only possible, but is of general occurrence.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As a consequence of continued variability, and
    more especially of reversion, all highly improved races, if
    neglected or not subjected to incessant selection, soon degenerate.
    Youatt gives a curious instance of this in some cattle formerly
    kept in Glamorganshire; but in this case the cattle were not fed
    with sufficient care. Mr. Baker, in his memoir on the Horse, sums
    up: "It must have been observed in the preceding pages that,
    whenever there has been neglect, the breed has proportionally
    deteriorated."<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> If a considerable
    number of improved cattle, sheep, or other animals of the same
    race, were allowed to breed freely together, with no selection, but
    with no change in their condition of life, there can be no doubt
    that after a score or hundred generations they would be very far
    from excellent of their kind; but, from what we see of the many
    common races of dogs, cattle, fowls, pigeons, etc., which without
    any particular care have long retained nearly the same character,
    we have no grounds for believing that they would altogether depart
    from their type.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is a general belief amongst breeders that
    characters of all kinds become fixed by long-continued inheritance.
    But I have attempted to show in the fourteenth chapter that this
    belief apparently resolves itself into the following proposition,
    namely, that all characters whatever, whether recently acquired or
    ancient, tend to be transmitted, but that those which have already
    long withstood all counteracting influences, will, as a general
    rule, continue to withstand them, and consequently be faithfully
    transmitted.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Tendency in Man to carry the practice of Selection to an
      extreme point.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is an important principle that in the process
    of selection man almost invariably wishes to go to an extreme
    point. Thus, there is no limit to his desire to breed certain kinds
    of horses and dogs as fleet as possible, and others as strong as
    possible; certain kinds of sheep for extreme fineness, and others
    for extreme length of wool; and he wishes to produce fruit, grain,
    tubers, and other useful parts of plants, as large and excellent as
    possible. With animals bred for amusement, the same principle is
    even more powerful; for fashion, as we see in our dress, always
    runs to extremes. This view has been expressly admitted by
    fanciers. Instances were given in the chapters on the pigeon, but
    here is another: Mr. Eaton, after describing a comparatively new
    variety, namely, the Archangel, remarks, "What fanciers intend
    doing with this bird I am at a loss to know, whether they intend to
    breed it down to the tumbler's head and beak, or carry it out to
    the carrier's head and beak; leaving it as they found it, is not
    progressing." Ferguson, speaking of fowls, says, "their
    peculiarities, whatever they may be, must necessarily be fully
    developed: a little peculiarity forms nought but ugliness, seeing
    it violates the existing laws of symmetry." So Mr. Brent, in
    discussing the merits of the sub-varieties of the Belgian
    canary-bird, remarks, "Fanciers always go to extremes; they do not
    admire indefinite properties."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This principle, which necessarily leads to
    divergence of character, explains the present state of various
    domestic races. We can thus see how it is that racehorses and
    dray-horses, greyhounds and mastiffs, which are opposed to each
    other in every character,&#8212;how varieties so distinct as
    Cochin-china fowls and bantams, or carrier-pigeons with very long
    beaks, and tumblers with excessively short beaks, have been derived
    from the same stock. As each breed is slowly improved, the inferior
    varieties are first neglected and finally lost. In a few cases, by
    the aid of old records, or from intermediate varieties still
    existing in countries where other fashions have prevailed, we are
    enabled partially to trace the graduated changes through which
    certain breeds have passed. Selection, whether methodical or
    unconscious, always tending towards an extreme point, together with
    the neglect and slow extinction of the intermediate and less-valued
    forms, is the key which unlocks the mystery of how man has produced
    such wonderful results.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In a few instances selection, guided by utility
    for a single purpose, has led to convergence of character. All the
    improved and different races of the pig, as Nathusius has well
    shown,<A href="#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> closely approach each
    other in character, in their shortened legs and muzzles, their
    almost hairless, large, rounded bodies, and small tusks. We see
    some degree of convergence in the similar outline of the body in
    well-bred cattle belonging to distinct races.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> I know of no other such cases.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Continued divergence of character depends on,
    and is indeed a clear proof, as previously remarked, of the same
    parts continuing to vary in the same direction. The tendency to
    mere general variability or plasticity of organisation can
    certainly be inherited, even from one parent, as has been shown by
    G&#228;rtner and K&#246;lreuter, in the production of varying
    hybrids from two species, of which one alone was variable. It is in
    itself probable that, when an organ has varied in any manner, it
    will again vary in the same manner, if the conditions which first
    caused the being to vary remain, as far as can be judged, the same.
    This is either tacitly or expressly admitted by all
    horticulturists: if a gardener observes one or two additional
    petals in a flower, he feels confident that in a few generations he
    will be able to raise a double flower, crowded with petals. Some of
    the seedlings from the weeping Moccas oak were so prostrate that
    they only crawled along the ground. A seedling from the fastigiate
    or upright Irish yew is described as differing greatly from the
    parent-form "by the exaggeration of the fastigiate habit of its
    branches."<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> Mr. Shirreff, who has
    been highly successful in raising new kinds of wheat, remarks, "A
    good variety may safely be regarded as the forerunner of a better
    one."<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> A great rose-grower, Mr.
    Rivers, has made the same remark with respect to roses. Sageret,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> who had large experience, in
    speaking of the future progress of fruit-trees, observes that the
    most important principle is "that the more plants have departed
    from their original type, the more they tend to depart from it."
    There is apparently much truth in this remark; for we can in no
    other way understand the surprising amount of difference between
    varieties in the parts or qualities which are valued, whilst other
    parts retain nearly their original character.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The foregoing discussion naturally leads to the
    question, what is the limit to the possible amount of variation in
    any part or quality, and, consequently, is there any limit to what
    selection can effect? Will a racehorse ever be reared fleeter than
    Eclipse? Can our prize-cattle and sheep be still further improved?
    Will a gooseberry ever weigh more than that produced by "London" in
    1852? Will the beet-root in France yield a greater percentage of
    sugar? Will future varieties of wheat and other grain produce
    heavier crops than our present varieties? These questions cannot be
    positively answered; but it is certain that we ought to be cautious
    in answering them by a negative. In some lines of variation the
    limit has probably been reached. Youatt believes that the reduction
    of bone in some of our sheep has already been carried so far that
    it entails great delicacy of constitution.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> But seeing the great improvement within
    recent times in our cattle and sheep, and especially in our pigs;
    seeing the wonderful increase in weight in our poultry of all kinds
    during the last few years; he would be a bold man who would assert
    that perfection has been reached. It has often been said that
    Eclipse never was, and never will be, beaten in speed by any other
    horse; but on making inquiries I find that the best judges believe
    that our present racehorses are fleeter.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> The attempt to raise a new variety of
    wheat more productive than the many old kinds, might have been
    thought until lately quite hopeless; but this has been effected by
    Major Hallett, by careful selection. With respect to almost all our
    animals and plants, those who are best qualified to judge do not
    believe that the extreme point of perfection has yet been reached
    even in the characters which have already been carried to a high
    standard. For instance, the short-faced tumbler-pigeon has been
    greatly modified; nevertheless, according to Mr. Eaton<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> "the field is still as open for fresh
    competitors as it was one hundred years ago." Over and over again
    it has been said that perfection had been attained with our
    flowers, but a higher standard has soon been reached. Hardly any
    fruit has been more improved than the strawberry, yet a great
    authority remarks,<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> "it must not
    be concealed that we are far from the extreme limits at which we
    may arrive."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">No doubt there is a limit beyond which the
    organisation cannot be modified compatibly with health or life. The
    extreme degree of fleetness, for instance, of which a terrestrial
    animal is capable, may have been acquired by our present
    racehorses; but as Mr. Wallace has well remarked,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> the question that interests us, "is not
    whether indefinite and unlimited change in any or all directions is
    possible, but whether such differences as do occur in nature could
    have been produced by the accumulation of varieties by selection."
    And in the case of our domestic productions, there can be no doubt
    that many parts of the organisation, to which man has attended,
    have been thus modified to a greater degree than the corresponding
    parts in the natural species of the same genera or even families.
    We see this in the form and size of our light and heavy dogs or
    horses,&#8212;in the beak and many other characters of our
    pigeons,&#8212;in the size and quality of many fruits,&#8212;in
    comparison with the species belonging to the same natural
    groups.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Time is an important element in the formation of
    our domestic races, as it permits innumerable individuals to be
    born, and these when exposed to diversified conditions are rendered
    variable. Methodical selection has been occasionally practised from
    an ancient period to the present day, even by semi-civilised
    people, and during former times will have produced some effect.
    Unconscious selection will have been still more effective; for
    during a lengthened period the more valuable individual animals
    will occasionally have been saved, and the less valuable neglected.
    In the course of time, different varieties, especially in the less
    civilised countries, will also have been more or less modified
    through natural selection. It is generally believed, though on this
    head we have little or no evidence, that new characters in time
    become fixed; and after having long remained fixed it seems
    possible that under new conditions they might again be rendered
    variable.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">How great the lapse of time has been since man
    first domesticated animals and cultivated plants, we begin dimly to
    see. When the lake-dwellings of Switzerland were inhabited during
    the Neolithic period, several animals were already domesticated and
    various plants cultivated. The science of language tells us that
    the art of ploughing and sowing the land was followed, and the
    chief animals had been already domesticated, at an epoch so
    immensely remote, that the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, Celtic,
    and Sclavonic languages had not as yet diverged from their common
    parent-tongue.<A href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is scarcely possible to overrate the effects
    of selection occasionally carried on in various ways and places
    during thousands of generations. All that we know, and, in a still
    stronger degree, all that we do not know,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> of the history of the great majority of
    our breeds, even of our more modern breeds, agrees with the view
    that their production, through the action of unconscious and
    methodical selection, has been almost insensibly slow. When a man
    attends rather more closely than is usual to the breeding of his
    animals, he is almost sure to improve them to a slight extent. They
    are in consequence valued in his immediate neighbourhood, and are
    bred by others; and their characteristic features, whatever these
    may be, will then slowly but steadily be increased, sometimes by
    methodical and almost always by unconscious selection. At last a
    strain, deserving to be called a sub-variety, becomes a little more
    widely known, receives a local name, and spreads. The spreading
    will have been extremely slow during ancient and less civilised
    times, but now is rapid. By the time that the new breed had assumed
    a somewhat distinct character, its history, hardly noticed at the
    time, will have been completely forgotten; for, as Low remarks,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> "we know how quickly the memory of
    such events is effaced."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As soon as a new breed is thus formed, it is
    liable through the same process to break up into new strains and
    sub-varieties. For different varieties are suited for, and are
    valued under, different circumstances. Fashion changes, but, should
    a fashion last for even a moderate length of time, so strong is the
    principle of inheritance, that some effect will probably be
    impressed on the breed. Thus varieties go on increasing in number,
    and history shows us how wonderfully they have increased since the
    earliest records.<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> As each new
    variety is produced, the earlier, intermediate, and less valuable
    forms will be neglected, and perish. When a breed, from not being
    valued, is kept in small numbers, its extinction almost inevitably
    follows sooner or later, either from accidental causes of
    destruction or from close interbreeding; and this is an event
    which, in the case of well-marked breeds, excites attention. The
    birth or production of a new domestic race is so slow a process
    that it escapes notice; its death or destruction is comparatively
    sudden, is often recorded, and when too late sometimes
    regretted.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Several authors have drawn a wide distinction
    between artificial and natural races. The latter are more uniform
    in character, possessing in a high degree the appearance of natural
    species, and are of ancient origin. They are generally found in
    less civilised countries, and have probably been largely modified
    by natural selection, and only to a small extent by man's
    unconscious and methodical selection. They have, also, during a
    long period, been directly acted on by the physical conditions of
    the countries which they inhabit. The so-called artificial races,
    on the other hand, are not so uniform in character; some have a
    semi-monstrous character, such as "the wry-legged terriers so
    useful in rabbit-shooting,"<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
    turnspit dogs, ancon sheep, niata oxen, Polish fowls,
    fantail-pigeons, etc.; their characteristic features have generally
    been acquired suddenly, though subsequently increased by careful
    selections in many cases. Other races, which certainly must be
    called artificial, for they have been largely modified by
    methodical selection and by crossing, as the English racehorse,
    terrier-dogs, the English game-cock, Antwerp carrier-pigeons, etc.,
    nevertheless cannot be said to have an unnatural appearance; and no
    distinct line, as it seems to me, can be drawn between natural and
    artificial races.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising that domestic races should
    generally present a different aspect from natural species. Man
    selects and propagates modifications solely for his own use or
    fancy, and not for the creature's own good. His attention is struck
    by strongly marked modifications, which have appeared suddenly, due
    to some great disturbing cause in the organisation. He attends
    almost exclusively to external characters; and when he succeeds in
    modifying internal organs,&#8212;when for instance he reduces the
    bones and offal, or loads the viscera with fat, or gives early
    maturity, etc.-the chances are strong that he will at the same time
    weaken the constitution. On the other hand, when an animal has to
    struggle throughout its life with many competitors and enemies,
    under circumstances inconceivably complex and liable to change,
    modifications of the most varied nature in the internal organs as
    well as in external characters, in the functions and mutual
    relations of parts, will be rigorously tested, preserved, or
    rejected. Natural selection often checks man's comparatively feeble
    and capricious attempts at improvement; and if it were not so, the
    result of his work, and of nature's work, would be even still more
    different. Nevertheless, we must not overrate the amount of
    difference between natural species and domestic races; the most
    experienced naturalists have often disputed whether the latter are
    descended from one or from several aboriginal stocks, and this
    clearly shows that there is no palpable difference between species
    and races.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Domestic races propagate their kind far more
    truly, and endure for munch longer periods, than most naturalists
    are willing to admit. Breeders feel no doubt on this head: ask a
    man who has long reared Shorthorn or Hereford cattle, Leicester or
    Southdown sheep, Spanish or Game poultry, tumbler or
    carrier-pigeons, whether these races may not have been derived from
    common progenitors, and he will probably laugh you to scorn. The
    breeder admits that he may hope to produce sheep with finer or
    longer wool and with better carcases, or handsomer fowls, or
    carrier-pigeons with beaks just perceptibly longer to the practised
    eye, and thus be successful at an exhibition. Thus far he will go,
    but no farther. He does not reflect on what follows from adding up
    during a long course of time many slight, successive modifications;
    nor does he reflect on the former existence of numerous varieties,
    connecting the links in each divergent line of descent. He
    concludes, as was shown in the earlier chapters, that all the chief
    breeds to which he has long attended are aboriginal productions.
    The systematic naturalist, on the other hand, who generally knows
    nothing of the art of breeding, who does not pretend to know how
    and when the several domestic races were formed, who cannot have
    seen the intermediate gradations, for they do not now exist,
    nevertheless feels no doubt that these races are sprung from a
    single source. But ask him whether the closely allied natural
    species which he has studied may not have descended from a common
    progenitor, and he in his turn will perhaps reject the notion with
    scorn. Thus the naturalist and breeder may mutually learn a useful
    lesson from each other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Summary on Selection by Man.</I>&#8212;There
    can be no doubt that methodical selection has effected and will
    effect wonderful results. It was occasionally practised in ancient
    times, and is still practised by semi-civilised people. Characters
    of the highest importance, and others of trifling value, have been
    attended to, and modified. I need not here repeat what has been so
    often said on the part which unconscious selection has played: we
    see its power in the difference between flocks which have been
    separately bred, and in the slow changes, as circumstances have
    slowly changed, which many animals have undergone in the same
    country, or when transported into a foreign land. We see the
    combined effects of methodical and unconscious selection, in the
    great amount of difference in those parts or qualities which are
    valued by man in comparison with the parts which are not valued,
    and consequently have not been attended to. Natural selection often
    determines man's power of selection. We sometimes err in imagining
    that characters, which are considered as unimportant by the
    systematic naturalist, could not be affected by the struggle for
    existence, and could not be acted on by natural selection; but
    striking cases have been given, showing how great an error this
    is.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The possibility of selection coming into action
    rests on variability; and this is mainly caused, as we shall
    hereafter see, by changes in the conditions of life. Selection is
    sometimes rendered difficult, or even impossible, by the conditions
    being opposed to the desired character or quality. It is sometimes
    checked by the lessened fertility and weakened constitution which
    follow from long-continued close interbreeding. That methodical
    selection may be successful, the closest attention and discernment,
    combined with unwearied patience, are absolutely necessary; and
    these same qualities, though not indispensable, are highly
    serviceable in the case of unconscious selection. It is almost
    necessary that a large number of individuals should be reared; for
    thus there will be a fair chance of variations of the desired
    nature arising, and of every individual with the slightest blemish
    or in any degree inferior being freely rejected. Hence length of
    time is an important element of success. Thus, also, reproduction
    at an early age and at short intervals favours the work. Facility
    in pairing animals, or their inhabiting a confined area, is
    advantageous as a check to free crossing. Whenever and wherever
    selection is not practised, distinct races are not formed within
    the same country. When any one part of the body or one quality is
    not attended to, it remains either unchanged or varies in a
    fluctuating manner, whilst at the same time other parts and other
    qualities may become permanently and greatly modified. But from the
    tendency to reversion and to continued variability, those parts or
    organs which are now undergoing rapid improvement through
    selection, are likewise found to vary much. Consequently
    highly-bred animals when neglected soon degenerate; but we have no
    reason to believe that the effects of long-continued selection
    would, if the conditions of life remained the same, be soon and
    completely lost.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Man always tends to go to an extreme point in
    the selection, whether methodical or unconscious, of all useful and
    pleasing qualities. This is an important principle, as it leads to
    continued divergence, and in some rare cases to convergence of
    character. The possibility of continued divergence rests on the
    tendency in each part or organ to go on varying in the same manner
    in which it has already varied; and that this occurs, is proved by
    the steady and gradual improvement of many animals and plants
    during lengthened periods. The principle of divergence of
    character, combined with the neglect and final extinction of all
    previous, less-valued, and intermediate varieties, explains the
    amount of difference and the distinctness of our several races.
    Although we may have reached the utmost limit to which certain
    characters can be modified, yet we are far from having reached, as
    we have good reason to believe, the limit in the majority of cases.
    Finally, from the difference between selection as carried on by man
    and by nature, we can understand how it is that domestic races
    often, though by no means always, differ in general aspect from
    closely allied natural species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Throughout this chapter and elsewhere I have
    spoken of selection as the paramount power, yet its action
    absolutely depends on what we in our ignorance call spontaneous or
    accidental variability. Let an architect be compelled to build an
    edifice with uncut stones, fallen from a precipice. The shape of
    each fragment may be called accidental; yet the shape of each has
    been determined by the force of gravity, the nature of the rock,
    and the slope of the precipice,&#8212;events and circumstances, all
    of which depend on natural laws; but there is no relation between
    these laws and the purpose for which each fragment is used by the
    builder. In the same manner the variations of each creature are
    determined by fixed and immutable laws; but these bear no relation
    to the living structure which is slowly built up through the power
    of selection, whether this be natural or artificial selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If our architect succeeded in rearing a noble
    edifice, using the rough wedge-shaped fragments for the arches, the
    longer stones for the lintels, and so forth, we should admire his
    skill even in a higher degree than if he had used stones shaped for
    the purpose. So it is with selection, whether applied by man or by
    nature; for although variability is indispensably necessary, yet,
    when we look at some highly complex and excellently adapted
    organism, variability sinks to a quite subordinate position in
    importance in comparison with selection, in the same manner as the
    shape of each fragment used by our supposed architect is
    unimportant in comparison with his skill.</P>
