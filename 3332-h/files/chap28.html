    <P align="JUSTIFY">As summaries have been added to nearly all the
    chapters, and as, in the chapter on pangenesis, various subjects,
    such as the forms of reproduction, inheritance, reversion, the
    causes and laws of variability, etc., have been recently discussed,
    I will here only make a few general remarks on the more important
    conclusions which may be deduced from the multifarious details
    given throughout this work.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Savages in all parts of the world easily succeed
    in taming wild animals; and those inhabiting any country or island,
    when first visited by man, would probably have been still more
    easily tamed. Complete subjugation generally depends on an animal
    being social in its habits, and on receiving man as the chief of
    the herd or family. In order that an animal should be domesticated
    it must be fertile under changed conditions of life, and this is
    far from being always the case. An animal would not have been worth
    the labour of domestication, at least during early times, unless of
    service to man. From these circumstances the number of domesticated
    animals has never been large. With respect to plants, I have shown
    in the ninth chapter how their varied uses were probably first
    discovered, and the early steps in their cultivation. Man could not
    have known, when he first domesticated an animal or plant, whether
    it would flourish and multiply when transported to other countries,
    therefore he could not have been thus influenced in his choice. We
    see that the close adaptation of the reindeer and camel to
    extremely cold and hot countries has not prevented their
    domestication. Still less could man have foreseen whether his
    animals and plants would vary in succeeding generations and thus
    give birth to new races; and the small capacity of variability in
    the goose has not prevented its domestication from a remote
    epoch.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With extremely few exceptions, all animals and
    plants which have been long domesticated have varied greatly. It
    matters not under what climate, or for what purpose they are kept,
    whether as food for man or beast, for draught or hunting, for
    clothing or mere pleasure,&#8212;under all these circumstances
    races have been produced which differ more from one another than do
    the forms which in a state of nature are ranked as different
    species. Why certain animals and plants have varied more under
    domestication than others we do not know, any more than why some
    are rendered more sterile than others under changed conditions of
    life. But we have to judge of the amount of variation which our
    domestic productions have undergone, chiefly by the number and
    amount of difference between the races which have been formed, and
    we can often clearly see why many and distinct races have not been
    formed, namely, because slight successive variations have not been
    steadily accumulated; and such variations will never be accumulated
    if an animal or plant be not closely observed, much valued, and
    kept in large numbers.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The fluctuating, and, as far as we can judge,
    never-ending variability of our domesticated productions,&#8212;the
    plasticity of almost their whole organisation,--is one of the most
    important lessons which we learn from the numerous details given in
    the earlier chapters of this work. Yet domesticated animals and
    plants can hardly have been exposed to greater changes in their
    conditions of life than have many natural species during the
    incessant geological, geographical, and climatal changes to which
    the world has been subject; but domesticated productions will often
    have been exposed to more sudden changes and to less continuously
    uniform conditions. As man has domesticated so many animals and
    plants belonging to widely different classes, and as he certainly
    did not choose with prophetic instinct those species which would
    vary most, we may infer that all natural species, if exposed to
    analogous conditions, would, on an average, vary to the same
    degree. Few men at the present day will maintain that animals and
    plants were created with a tendency to vary, which long remained
    dormant, in order that fanciers in after ages might rear, for
    instance, curious breeds of the fowl, pigeon, or canary-bird.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From several causes it is difficult to judge of
    the amount of modification which our domestic productions have
    undergone. In some cases the primitive parent-stock has become
    extinct; or it cannot be recognised with certainty, owing to its
    supposed descendants having been so much modified. In other cases
    two or more closely-allied forms, after being domesticated, have
    crossed; and then it is difficult to estimate how much of the
    character of the present descendants ought to be attributed to
    variation, and how much to the influence of the several
    parent-stocks. But the degree to which our domesticated breeds have
    been modified by the crossing of distinct species has probably been
    much exaggerated by some authors. A few individuals of one form
    would seldom permanently affect another form existing in greater
    numbers; for, without careful selection, the stain of the foreign
    blood would soon be obliterated, and during early and barbarous
    times, when our animals were first domesticated, such care would
    seldom have been taken.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is good reason to believe in the case of
    the dog, ox, pig, and of some other animals, that several of our
    races are descended from distinct wild prototypes; nevertheless the
    belief in the multiple origin of our domesticated animals has been
    extended by some few naturalists and by many breeders to an
    unauthorised extent. Breeders refuse to look at the whole subject
    under a single point of view; I have heard it said by a man, who
    maintained that our fowls were descended from at least half-a-dozen
    aboriginal species, that the evidence of the common origin of
    pigeons, ducks and rabbits, was of no avail with respect to fowls.
    Breeders overlook the improbability of many species having been
    domesticated at an early and barbarous period. They do not consider
    the improbability of species having existed in a state of nature
    which, if they resembled our present domestic breeds, would have
    been highly abnormal in comparison with all their congeners. They
    maintain that certain species, which formerly existed, have become
    extinct, or are now unknown, although formerly known. The
    assumption of so much recent extinction is no difficulty in their
    eyes; for they do not judge of its probability by the facility or
    difficulty of the extinction of other closely-allied wild forms.
    Lastly, they often ignore the whole subject of geographical
    distribution as completely as if it were the result of chance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although from the reasons just assigned it is
    often difficult to judge accurately of the amount of change which
    our domesticated productions have undergone, yet this can be
    ascertained in the cases in which all the breeds are known to be
    descended from a single species,&#8212;as with the pigeon, duck,
    rabbit, and almost certainly with the fowl; and by the aid of
    analogy this can be judged of to a certain extent with domesticated
    animals descended from several wild stocks. It is impossible to
    read the details given in the earlier chapters and in many
    published works, or to visit our various exhibitions, without being
    deeply impressed with the extreme variability of our domesticated
    animals and cultivated plants. No part of the organisation escapes
    the tendency to vary. The variations generally affect parts of
    small vital or physiological importance, but so it is with the
    differences which exist between closely-allied species. In these
    unimportant characters there is often a greater difference between
    the breeds of the same species than between the natural species of
    the same genus, as Isidore Geoffroy has shown to be the case with
    size, and as is often the case with the colour, texture, form,
    etc., of the hair, feathers, horns, and other dermal
    appendages.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has often been asserted that important parts
    never vary under domestication, but this is a complete error. Look
    at the skull of the pig in any one of the highly improved breeds,
    with the occipital condyles and other parts greatly modified; or
    look at that of the niata ox. Or, again, in the several breeds of
    the rabbit, observe the elongated skull, with the differently
    shaped occipital foramen, atlas, and other cervical vertebrae. The
    whole shape of the brain, together with the skull, has been
    modified in Polish fowls; in other breeds of the fowl the number of
    the vertebrae and the forms of the cervical vertebrae have been
    changed. In certain pigeons the shape of the lower jaw, the
    relative length of the tongue, the size of the nostrils and
    eyelids, the number and shape of the ribs, the form and size of the
    oesophagus, have all varied. In certain quadrupeds the length of
    the intestines has been much increased or diminished. With plants
    we see wonderful differences in the stones of various fruits. In
    the Cucurbitaceae several highly important characters have varied,
    such as the sessile position of the stigmas on the ovarium, the
    position of the carpels, and the projection of the ovarium out of
    the receptacle. But it would be useless to run through the many
    facts given in the earlier chapters.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is notorious how greatly the mental
    disposition, tastes, habits, consensual movements, loquacity or
    silence, and tone of voice have varied and been inherited in our
    domesticated animals. The dog offers the most striking instance of
    changed mental attributes, and these differences cannot be
    accounted for by descent from distinct wild types.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">New characters may appear and old ones disappear
    at any stage of development, being inherited at a corresponding
    stage. We see this in the difference between the eggs, the down on
    the chickens and the first plumage of the various breeds of the
    fowl; and still more plainly in the differences between the
    caterpillars and cocoons of the various breeds of the silk-moth.
    These facts, simple as they appear, throw light on the differences
    between the larval and adult states of allied natural species, and
    on the whole great subject of embryology. New characters first
    appearing late in life are apt to become attached exclusively to
    that sex in which they first arose, or they may be developed in a
    much higher degree in this than in the other sex; or again, after
    having become attached to one sex, they may be transferred to the
    opposite sex. These facts, and more especially the circumstance
    that new characters seem to be particularly liable, from some
    unknown cause, to become attached to the male sex, have an
    important bearing on the acquirement of secondary sexual characters
    by animals in a state of nature.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has sometimes been said that our domestic
    races do not differ in constitutional peculiarities, but this
    cannot be maintained. In our improved cattle, pigs, etc., the
    period of maturity, including that of the second dentition, has
    been much hastened. The period of gestation varies much, and has
    been modified in a fixed manner in one or two cases. In some breeds
    of poultry and pigeons the period at which the down and the first
    plumage are acquired, differs. The number of moults through which
    the larvae of silk-moths pass, varies. The tendency to fatten, to
    yield much milk, to produce many young or eggs at a birth or during
    life, differs in different breeds. We find different degrees of
    adaptation to climate, and different tendencies to certain
    diseases, to the attacks of parasites, and to the action of certain
    vegetable poisons. With plants, adaptation to certain soils, the
    power of resisting frost, the period of flowering and fruiting, the
    duration of life, the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining
    them throughout the winter, the proportion and nature of certain
    chemical compounds in the tissues or seeds, all vary.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is, however, one important constitutional
    difference between domestic races and species; I refer to the
    sterility which almost invariably follows, in a greater or less
    degree, when species are crossed, and to the perfect fertility of
    the most distinct domestic races, with the exception of a very few
    plants, when similarly crossed. It is certainly a most remarkable
    fact that many closely-allied species, which in appearance differ
    extremely little, should yield when crossed only a few more or less
    sterile offspring, or none at all; whilst domestic races which
    differ conspicuously from each other are, when united, remarkably
    fertile, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. But this fact is
    not in reality so inexplicable as it at first appears. In the first
    place, it was clearly shown in the nineteenth chapter that the
    sterility of crossed species does not depend chiefly on differences
    in their external structure or general constitution, but on
    differences in the reproductive system, analogous to those which
    cause the lessened fertility of the illegitimate unions of
    dimorphic and trimorphic plants. In the second place, the Pallasian
    doctrine, that species after having been long domesticated lose
    their natural tendency to sterility when crossed, has been shown to
    be highly probable or almost certain. We cannot avoid this
    conclusion when we reflect on the parentage and present fertility
    of the several breeds of the dog, of the Indian or humped and
    European cattle, and of the two chief kinds of pigs. Hence it would
    be unreasonable to expect that races formed under domestication
    should acquire sterility when crossed, whilst at the same time we
    admit that domestication eliminates the normal sterility of crossed
    species. Why with closely-allied species their reproductive systems
    should almost invariably have been modified in so peculiar a manner
    as to be mutually incapable of acting on each other&#8212;though in
    unequal degrees in the two sexes, as shown by the difference in
    fertility between reciprocal crosses of the same species&#8212;we
    do not know, but may with much probability infer the cause to be as
    follows. Most natural species have been habituated to nearly
    uniform conditions of life for an incomparably longer time than
    have domestic races; and we positively know that changed conditions
    exert an especial and powerful influence on the reproductive
    system. Hence this difference may well account for the difference
    in the power of reproduction between domestic races when crossed
    and species when crossed. It is probably in chief part owing to the
    same cause that domestic races can be suddenly transported from one
    climate to another, or placed under widely different conditions,
    and yet retain in most cases their fertility unimpaired; whilst a
    multitude of species subjected to lesser changes are rendered
    incapable of breeding.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The offspring of crossed domestic races and of
    crossed species resemble each other in most respects, with the one
    important exception of fertility; they often partake in the same
    unequal degree of the characters of their parents, one of which is
    often prepotent over the other; and they are liable to reversion of
    the same kind. By successive crosses one species may be made to
    absorb completely another, and so it notoriously is with races. The
    latter resemble species in many other ways. They sometimes inherit
    their newly-acquired characters almost or even quite as firmly as
    species. The conditions leading to variability and the laws
    governing its nature appear to be the same in both. Varieties can
    be classed in groups under groups, like species under genera, and
    these under families and orders; and the classification may be
    either artificial,&#8212;that is, founded on any arbitrary
    character,&#8212;or natural. With varieties a natural
    classification is certainly founded, and with species is apparently
    founded, on community of descent, together with the amount of
    modification which the forms have undergone. The characters by
    which domestic varieties differ from one another are more variable
    than those distinguishing species, though hardly more so than with
    certain polymorphic species; but this greater degree of variability
    is not surprising, as varieties have generally been exposed within
    recent times to fluctuating conditions of life, and are much more
    liable to have been crossed; they are also in many cases still
    undergoing, or have recently undergone, modification by man's
    methodical or unconscious selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Domestic varieties as a general rule certainly
    differ from one another in less important parts than do species;
    and when important differences occur, they are seldom firmly fixed;
    but this fact is intelligible, if we consider man's method of
    selection. In the living animal or plant he cannot observe internal
    modifications in the more important organs; nor does he regard them
    as long as they are compatible with health and life. What does the
    breeder care about any slight change in the molar teeth of his
    pigs, or for an additional molar tooth in the dog; or for any
    change in the intestinal canal or other internal organ? The breeder
    cares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with fat, and
    for an accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep, and
    this he has effected. What would the floriculturist care for any
    change in the structure of the ovarium or of the ovules? As
    important internal organs are certainly liable to numerous slight
    variations, and as these would probably be transmitted, for many
    strange monstrosities are inherited, man could undoubtedly effect a
    certain amount of change in these organs. When he has produced any
    modification in an important part, he has generally done so
    unintentionally, in correlation with some other conspicuous part.
    For instance, he has given ridges and protuberances to the skulls
    of fowls, by attending to the form of the comb, or to the plume of
    feathers on the head. By attending to the external form of the
    pouter-pigeon, he has enormously increased the size of the
    oesophagus, and has added to the number of the ribs, and given them
    greater breadth. With the carrier-pigeon, by increasing through
    steady selection the wattles on the upper mandible, he has greatly
    modified the form of the lower mandible; and so in many other
    cases. Natural species, on the other hand, have been modified
    exclusively for their own good, to fit them for infinitely
    diversified conditions of life, to avoid enemies of all kinds, and
    to struggle against a host of competitors. Hence, under such
    complex conditions, it would often happen that modifications of the
    most varied kinds, in important as well as in unimportant parts,
    would be advantageous or even necessary; and they would slowly but
    surely be acquired through the survival of the fittest. Still more
    important is the fact that various indirect modifications would
    likewise arise through the law of correlated variation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Domestic breeds often have an abnormal or
    semi-monstrous character, as amongst dogs, the Italian greyhound,
    bulldog, Blenheim spaniel, and bloodhound,&#8212;some breeds of
    cattle and pigs,&#8212;several breeds of the fowl,&#8212;and the
    chief breeds of the pigeon. In such abnormal breeds, parts which
    differ but slightly or not at all in the allied natural species,
    have been greatly modified. This may be accounted for by man's
    often selecting, especially at first, conspicuous and
    semi-monstrous deviations of structure. We should, however, be
    cautious in deciding what deviations ought to be called monstrous:
    there can hardly be a doubt that, if the brush of horse-like hair
    on the breast of the turkey-cock had first appeared in the
    domesticated bird, it would have been considered as a monstrosity;
    the great plume of feathers on the head of the Polish cock has been
    thus designated, though plumes are common on the heads of many
    kinds of birds; we might call the wattle or corrugated skin round
    the base of the beak of the English carrier-pigeon a monstrosity,
    but we do not thus speak of the globular fleshy excrescence at the
    base of the beak of the <I>Carpophaga oceanica.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some authors have drawn a wide distinction
    between artificial and natural breeds; although in extreme cases
    the distinction is plain, in many other cases it is arbitrary; the
    difference depending chiefly on the kind of selection which has
    been applied. Artificial breeds are those which have been
    intentionally improved by man; they frequently have an unnatural
    appearance, and are especially liable to lose their characters
    through reversion and continued variability. The so-called natural
    breeds, on the other hand, are those which are found in
    semi-civilised countries, and which formerly inhabited separate
    districts in nearly all the European kingdoms. They have been
    rarely acted on by man's intentional selection; more frequently by
    unconscious selection, and partly by natural selection, for animals
    kept in semi-civilised countries have to provide largely for their
    own wants. Such natural breeds will also have been directly acted
    on by the differences, though slight, in the surrounding
    conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is a much more important distinction
    between our several breeds, namely, in some having originated from
    a strongly-marked or semi-monstrous deviation of structure, which,
    however, may subsequently have been augmented by selection; whilst
    others have been formed in so slow and insensible a manner, that if
    we could see their early progenitors we should hardly be able to
    say when or how the breed first arose. From the history of the
    racehorse, greyhound, gamecock, etc., and from their general
    appearance, we may feel nearly confident that they were formed by a
    slow process of improvement; and we know that this has been the
    case with the carrier-pigeon, as well as with some other pigeons.
    On the other hand, it is certain that the ancon and mauchamp breeds
    of sheep, and almost certain that the niata cattle, turnspit, and
    pug-dogs, jumper and frizzled fowls, short-faced tumbler pigeons,
    hook-billed ducks, etc., suddenly appeared in nearly the same state
    as we now see them. So it has been with many cultivated plants. The
    frequency of these cases is likely to lead to the false belief that
    natural species have often originated in the same abrupt manner.
    But we have no evidence of the appearance, or at least of the
    continued procreation, under nature, of abrupt modifications of
    structure; and various general reasons could be assigned against
    such a belief.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, we have abundant evidence of
    the constant occurrence under nature of slight individual
    differences of the most diversified kinds; and we are thus led to
    conclude that species have generally originated by the natural
    selection of extremely slight differences. This process may be
    strictly compared with the slow and gradual improvement of the
    racehorse, greyhound, and gamecock. As every detail of structure in
    each species has to be closely adapted to its habits of life, it
    will rarely happen that one part alone will be modified; but, as
    was formerly shown, the co-adapted modifications need not be
    absolutely simultaneous. Many variations, however, are from the
    first connected by the law of correlation. Hence it follows that
    even closely-allied species rarely or never differ from one another
    by one character alone; and the same remark is to a certain extent
    applicable to domestic races; for these, if they differ much,
    generally differ in many respects.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some naturalists boldly insist<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> that species are absolutely distinct
    productions, never passing by intermediate links into one another;
    whilst they maintain that domestic varieties can always be
    connected either with one another or with their parent-forms. But
    if we could always find the links between the several breeds of the
    dog, horse, cattle, sheep, pigs, etc., there would not have been
    such incessant doubts whether they were descended from one or
    several species. The greyhound genus, if such a term may be used,
    cannot be closely connected with any other breed, unless, perhaps,
    we go back to the ancient Egyptian monuments. Our English bulldog
    also forms a very distinct breed. In all these cases crossed breeds
    must of course be excluded, for distinct natural species can thus
    be likewise connected. By what links can the Cochin fowl be closely
    united with others? By searching for breeds still preserved in
    distant lands, and by going back to historical records,
    tumbler-pigeons, carriers, and barbs can be closely connected with
    the parent rock-pigeon; but we cannot thus connect the turbit or
    the pouter. The degree of distinctness between the various domestic
    breeds depends on the amount of modification which they have
    undergone, and more especially on the neglect and final extinction
    of intermediate and less-valued forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has often been argued that no light is thrown
    on the changes which natural species are believed to undergo from
    the admitted changes of domestic races, as the latter are said to
    be mere temporary productions, always reverting, as soon as they
    become feral, to their pristine form. This argument has been well
    combated by Mr. Wallace<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> and full
    details were given in the thirteenth chapter, showing that the
    tendency to reversion in feral animals and plants has been greatly
    exaggerated, though no doubt it exists to a certain extent. It
    would be opposed to all the principles inculcated in this work, if
    domestic animals, when exposed to new conditions and compelled to
    struggle for their own wants against a host of foreign competitors,
    were not modified in the course of time. It should also be
    remembered that many characters lie latent in all organic beings,
    ready to be evolved under fitting conditions; and in breeds
    modified within recent times, the tendency to reversion is
    particularly strong. But the antiquity of some of our breeds
    clearly proves that they remain nearly constant as long as their
    conditions of life remain the same.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has been boldly maintained by some authors
    that the amount of variation to which our domestic productions are
    liable is strictly limited; but this is an assertion resting on
    little evidence. Whether or not the amount of change in any
    particular direction is limited, the tendency to general
    variability is, as far as we can judge, unlimited. Cattle, sheep,
    and pigs have varied under domestication from the remotest period,
    as shown by the researches of Rutimeyer and others; yet these
    animals have been improved to an unparalleled degree, within quite
    recent times, and this implies continued variability of structure.
    Wheat, as we know from the remains found in the Swiss
    lake-dwellings, is one of the most anciently cultivated plants, yet
    at the present day new and better varieties frequently arise. It
    may be that an ox will never be produced of larger size and finer
    proportions, or a racehorse fleeter, than our present animals, or a
    gooseberry larger than the London variety; but he would be a bold
    man who would assert that the extreme limit in these respects has
    been finally attained. With flowers and fruit it has repeatedly
    been asserted that perfection has been reached, but the standard
    has soon been excelled. A breed of pigeons may never be produced
    with a beak shorter than that of the present short-faced tumbler,
    or with one longer than that of the English carrier, for these
    birds have weak constitutions and are bad breeders; but shortness
    and length of beak are the points which have been steadily improved
    during the last 150 years, and some of the best judges deny that
    the goal has yet been reached. From reasons which could be
    assigned, it is probable that parts which have now reached their
    maximum development, might, after remaining constant during a long
    period, vary again in the direction of increase under new
    conditions of life. But there must be, as Mr. Wallace has remarked
    with much truth,<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> a limit to change
    in certain directions both with natural and domestic productions;
    for instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any
    terrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to
    be overcome, the weight to be carried, and the power of contraction
    in the muscular fibres. The English racehorse may have reached this
    limit; but it already surpasses in fleetness its own wild
    progenitor and all other equine species. The short-faced
    tumbler-pigeon has a beak shorter, and the carrier a beak longer,
    relatively to the size of their bodies, than that of any natural
    species of the family. Our apples, pears and gooseberries bear
    larger fruit than those of any natural species of the same genera;
    and so in many other cases.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising, seeing the great
    difference between many domestic breeds, that some few naturalists
    have concluded that each is descended from a distinct aboriginal
    stock, more especially as the principle of selection has been
    ignored, and the high antiquity of man, as a breeder of animals,
    has only recently become known. Most naturalists, however, freely
    admit that our various breeds, however dissimilar, are descended
    from a single stock, although they do not know much about the art
    of breeding, cannot show the connecting links, nor say where and
    when the breeds arose. Yet these same naturalists declare, with an
    air of philosophical caution, that they will never admit that one
    natural species has given birth to another until they behold all
    the transitional steps. Fanciers use exactly the same language with
    respect to domestic breeds; thus, an author of an excellent
    treatise on pigeons says he will never allow that the carrier and
    fantail are the descendants of the wild rock-pigeon, until the
    transitions have "actually been observed, and can be repeated
    whenever man chooses to set about the task." No doubt it is
    difficult to realise that slight changes added up during long
    centuries can produce such great results; but he who wishes to
    understand the origin of domestic breeds or of natural species must
    overcome this difficulty.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The causes which excite and the laws which
    govern variability have been discussed so lately, that I need here
    only enumerate the leading points. As domesticated organisms are
    much more liable to slight deviations of structure and to
    monstrosities than species living under their natural conditions,
    and as widely-ranging species generally vary more than those which
    inhabit restricted areas, we may infer that variability mainly
    depends on changed conditions of life. We must not overlook the
    effects of the unequal combination of the characters derived from
    both parents, or reversion to former progenitors. Changed
    conditions have an especial tendency to render the reproductive
    organs more or less impotent, as shown in the chapter devoted to
    this subject; and these organs consequently often fail to transmit
    faithfully the parental characters. Changed conditions also act
    directly and definitely on the organisation, so that all or nearly
    all the individuals of the same species thus exposed become
    modified in the same manner; but why this or that part is
    especially affected we can seldom or ever say. In most cases,
    however, a change in the conditions seems to act indefinitely,
    causing diversified variations in nearly the same manner as
    exposure to cold or the absorption of the same poison affects
    different individuals in different ways. We have reason to suspect
    that an habitual excess of highly-nutritious food, or an excess
    relatively to the wear and tear of the organisation from exercise,
    is a powerful exciting cause of variability. When we see the
    symmetrical and complex outgrowths, caused by a minute drop of the
    poison of a gall-insect, we may believe that slight changes in the
    chemical nature of the sap or blood would lead to extraordinary
    modifications of structure.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The increased use of a muscle with its various
    attached parts, and the increased activity of a gland or other
    organ, lead to their increased development. Disuse has a contrary
    effect. With domesticated productions, although their organs
    sometimes become rudimentary through abortion, we have no reason to
    suppose that this has ever followed solely from disuse. With
    natural species, on the contrary, many organs appear to have been
    rendered rudimentary through disuse, aided by the principle of the
    economy of growth together with intercrossing. Complete abortion
    can be accounted for only by the hypothesis given in the last
    chapter, namely, the final destruction of the germs or gemmules of
    useless parts. This difference between species and domestic
    varieties may be partly accounted for by disuse having acted on the
    latter for an insufficient length of time, and partly from their
    exemption from any severe struggle for existence entailing rigid
    economy in the development of each part, to which all species under
    nature are subjected. Nevertheless the law of compensation or
    balancement, which likewise depends on the economy of growth,
    apparently has affected to a certain extent our domesticated
    productions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As almost every part of the organisation becomes
    highly variable under domestication, and as variations are easily
    selected both consciously and unconsciously, it is very difficult
    to distinguish between the effects of the selection of indefinite
    variations and the direct action of the conditions of life. For
    instance, it is possible that the feet of our water-dogs and of the
    American dogs which have to travel much over the snow, may have
    become partially webbed from the stimulus of widely extending their
    toes; but it is more probable that the webbing, like the membrane
    between the toes of certain pigeons, spontaneously appeared and was
    afterwards increased by the best swimmers and the best
    snow-travellers being preserved during many generations. A fancier
    who wished to decrease the size of his bantams or tumbler-pigeons
    would never think of starving them, but would select the smallest
    individuals which spontaneously appeared. Quadrupeds are sometimes
    born destitute of hair and hairless breeds have been formed, but
    there is no reason to believe that this is caused by a hot climate.
    Within the tropics heat often causes sheep to lose their fleeces;
    on the other hand, wet and cold act as a direct stimulus to the
    growth of hair; but who will pretend to decide how far the thick
    fur of arctic animals, or their white colour, is due to the direct
    action of a severe climate, and how far to the preservation of the
    best-protected individuals during a long succession of
    generations?</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Of all the laws governing variability, that of
    correlation is one of the most important. In many cases of slight
    deviations of structure as well as of grave monstrosities, we
    cannot even conjecture what is the nature of the bond of connexion.
    But between homologous parts&#8212;between the fore and hind
    limbs&#8212;between the hair, hoofs, horns, and teeth&#8212;which
    are closely similar during their early development and which are
    exposed to similar conditions, we can see that they would be
    eminently liable to be modified in the same manner. Homologous
    parts, from having the same nature, are apt to blend together, and,
    when many exist, to vary in number.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although every variation is either directly or
    indirectly caused by some change in the surrounding conditions, we
    must never forget that the nature of the organisation which is
    acted on, is by far the more important factor in the result. We see
    this in different organisms, which when placed under similar
    conditions vary in a different manner, whilst closely-allied
    organisms under dissimilar conditions often vary in nearly the same
    manner. We see this, in the same modification frequently
    reappearing in the same variety at long intervals of time, and
    likewise in the several striking cases given of analogous or
    parallel variations. Although some of these latter cases are due to
    reversion, others cannot thus be accounted for.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the indirect action of changed conditions
    on the organisation, owing to the reproductive organs being thus
    affected&#8212;from the direct action of such conditions, and these
    will cause the individuals of the same species either to vary in
    the same manner, or differently in accordance with slight
    differences in their constitution&#8212;from the effects of the
    increased or decreased use of parts&#8212;and from
    correlation,&#8212;the variability of our domesticated productions
    is complicated to an extreme degree. The whole organisation becomes
    slightly plastic. Although each modification must have its own
    exciting cause, and though each is subjected to law, yet we can so
    rarely trace the precise relation between cause and effect, that we
    are tempted to speak of variations as if they arose spontaneously.
    We may even call them accidental, but this must be only in the
    sense in which we say that a fragment of rock dropped from a height
    owes its shape to accident.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It may be worth while briefly to consider the
    result of the exposure to unnatural conditions of a large number of
    animals of the same species and allowed to cross freely with no
    selection of any kind, and afterwards to consider the result when
    selection is brought into play. Let us suppose that 500 wild
    rock-pigeons were confined in their native land in an aviary and
    fed in the same manner as pigeons usually are; and that they were
    not allowed to increase in number. As pigeons propagate so rapidly,
    I suppose that a thousand or fifteen hundred birds would have to be
    annually killed. After several generations had been thus reared, we
    may feel sure that some of the young birds would vary, and the
    variations would tend to be inherited; for at the present day
    slight deviations of structure often occur and are inherited. It
    would be tedious even to enumerate the multitude of points which
    still go on varying or have recently varied. Many variations would
    occur in correlation with one another, as the length of the wing
    and tail feathers&#8212;the number of the primary wing-feathers, as
    well as the number and breadth of the ribs, in correlation with the
    size and form of the body&#8212;the number of the scutellae with
    the size of the feet&#8212;the length of the tongue with the length
    of the beak&#8212;the size of the nostrils and eyelids and the form
    of lower jaw in correlation with the development of
    wattle&#8212;the nakedness of the young with the future colour of
    the plumage&#8212;the size of the feet with that of the beak, and
    other such points. Lastly, as our birds are supposed to be confined
    in an aviary, they would use their wings and legs but little, and
    certain parts of the skeleton, such as the sternum, scapulae and
    feet, would in consequence become slightly reduced in size.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As in our assumed case many birds have to be
    indiscriminately killed every year, the chances are against any new
    variety surviving long enough to breed. And as the variations which
    arise are of an extremely diversified nature, the chances are very
    great against two birds pairing which have varied in the same
    manner; nevertheless, a varying bird even when not thus paired
    would occasionally transmit its character to its young; and these
    would not only be exposed to the same conditions which first caused
    the variation in question to appear, but would in addition inherit
    from their modified parent a tendency again to vary in the same
    manner. So that, if the conditions decidedly tended to induce some
    particular variation, all the birds might in the course of time
    become similarly modified. But a far commoner result would be, that
    one bird would vary in one way and another bird in another way; one
    would be born with a beak a little longer, and another with a
    shorter beak; one would gain some black feathers, another some
    white or red feathers. And as these birds would be continually
    intercrossing, the final result would be a body of individuals
    differing from each other in many ways, but only slightly; yet more
    than did the original rock-pigeons. But there would not be the
    least tendency towards the formation of several distinct
    breeds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If two separate lots of pigeons were treated in
    the manner just described, one in England and the other in a
    tropical country, the two lots being supplied with different kinds
    of food, would they after many generations differ? When we reflect
    on the cases given in the twenty-third chapter, and on such facts
    as the difference in former times between the breeds of cattle,
    sheep, etc., in almost every district of Europe, we are strongly
    inclined to admit that the two lots would be differently modified
    through the influence of climate and food. But the evidence on the
    definite action of changed conditions is in most cases
    insufficient; and, with respect to pigeons, I have had the
    opportunity of examining a large collection of domesticated kinds,
    sent to me by Sir W. Elliot from India, and they varied in a
    remarkably similar manner with our European birds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If two distinct breeds were mingled together in
    equal numbers, there is reason to suspect that they would to a
    certain extent prefer pairing with their own kind; but they would
    often intercross. From the greater vigour and fertility of the
    crossed offspring, the whole body would by this means become
    interblended sooner than would otherwise have occurred. From
    certain breeds being prepotent over others, it does not follow that
    the interblended progeny would be strictly intermediate in
    character. I have, also, proved that the act of crossing in itself
    gives a strong tendency to reversion, so that the crossed offspring
    would tend to revert to the state of the aboriginal rock-pigeon;
    and in the course of time they would probably be not much more
    heterogeneous in character than in our first case, when birds of
    the same breed were confined together.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have just said that the crossed offspring
    would gain in vigour and fertility. From the facts given in the
    seventeenth chapter there can be no doubt of this fact; and there
    can be little doubt, though the evidence on this head is not so
    easily acquired, that long-continued close interbreeding leads to
    evil results. With hermaphrodites of all kinds, if the sexual
    elements of the same individual habitually acted on each other, the
    closest possible interbreeding would be perpetual. But we should
    bear in mind that the structure of all hermaphrodite animals, as
    far as I can learn, permits and frequently necessitates a cross
    with a distinct individual. With hermaphrodite plants we
    incessantly meet with elaborate and perfect contrivances for this
    same end. It is no exaggeration to assert that, if the use of the
    talons and tusks of a carnivorous animal, or of the plumes and
    hooks on a seed, may be safely inferred from their structure, we
    may with equal safety infer that many flowers are constructed for
    the express purpose of ensuring a cross with a distinct plant. From
    these various considerations, not to mention the result of a long
    series of experiments which I have tried, the conclusion arrived at
    in the chapter just referred to&#8212;namely, that great good of
    some kind is derived from the sexual concourse of distinct
    individuals&#8212;must be admitted.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To return to our illustration: we have hitherto
    assumed that the birds were kept down to the same number by
    indiscriminate slaughter; but if the least choice be permitted in
    their preservation, the whole result will be changed. Should the
    owner observe any slight variation in one of his birds, and wish to
    obtain a breed thus characterised, he would succeed in a
    surprisingly short time by careful selection. As any part which has
    once varied generally goes on varying in the same direction, it is
    easy, by continually preserving the most strongly marked
    individuals, to increase the amount of difference up to a high,
    predetermined standard of excellence. This is methodical
    selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If the owner of the aviary, without any thought
    of making a new breed, simply admired, for instance, short-beaked
    more than long-beaked birds, he would, when he had to reduce the
    number, generally kill the latter; and there can be no doubt that
    he would thus in the course of time sensibly modify his stock. It
    is improbable, if two men were to keep pigeons and act in this
    manner, that they would prefer exactly the same characters; they
    would, as we know, often prefer directly opposite characters, and
    the two lots would ultimately come to differ. This has actually
    occurred with strains or families of cattle, sheep, and pigeons,
    which have been long kept and carefully attended to by different
    breeders, without any wish on their part to form new and distinct
    sub-breeds. This unconscious kind of selection will more especially
    come into action with animals which are highly serviceable to man;
    for every one tries to get the best dogs, horses, cows, or sheep,
    without thinking about their future progeny, yet these animals
    would transmit more or less surely their good qualities to their
    offspring. Nor is any one so careless as to breed from his worst
    animals. Even savages, when compelled from extreme want to kill
    some of their animals, would destroy the worst and preserve the
    best. With animals kept for use and not for mere amusement,
    different fashions prevail in different districts, leading to the
    preservation, and consequently to the transmission, of all sorts of
    trifling peculiarities of character. The same process will have
    been pursued with our fruit-trees and vegetables, for the best will
    always have been the most largely cultivated, and will occasionally
    have yielded seedlings better than their parents.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The different strains, just alluded to, which
    have been actually produced by breeders without any wish on their
    part to obtain such a result, afford excellent evidence of the
    power of unconscious selection. This form of selection has probably
    led to far more important results than methodical selection, and is
    likewise more important under a theoretical point of view from
    closely resembling natural selection. For during this process the
    best or most valued individuals are not separated and prevented
    from crossing with others of the same breed, but are simply
    preferred and preserved; yet this inevitably leads to their gradual
    modification and improvement; so that finally they prevail, to the
    exclusion of the old parent-form.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With our domesticated animals natural selection
    checks the production of races with any injurious deviation of
    structure. In the case of animals which, from being kept by savages
    or semi-civilised people, have to provide largely for their own
    wants under different circumstances, natural selection will have
    played a more important part. Hence it probably is that they often
    closely resemble natural species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As there is no limit to man's desire to possess
    animals and plants more and more useful in any respect, and as the
    fancier always wishes, owing to fashions running into extremes, to
    produce each character more and more strongly pronounced, there is,
    through the prolonged action of methodical and unconscious
    selection, a constant tendency in every breed to become more and
    more different from its parent-stock; and when several breeds have
    been produced and are valued for different qualities, to differ
    more and more from each other. This leads to Divergence of
    Character. As improved sub-varieties and races are slowly formed,
    the older and less improved breeds are neglected and decrease in
    number. When few individuals of any breed exist within the same
    locality, close interbreeding, by lessening their vigour and
    fertility, aids in their final extinction. Thus the intermediate
    links are lost, and the remaining breeds gain in Distinctness of
    Character.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the chapters on the Pigeon, it was proved by
    historical evidence and by the existence of connecting
    sub-varieties in distant lands that several breeds have steadily
    diverged in character, and that many old and intermediate
    sub-breeds have been lost. Other cases could be adduced of the
    extinction of domestic breeds, as of the Irish wolf-dog, the old
    English hound, and of two breeds in France, one of which was
    formerly highly valued.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Mr.
    Pickering remarks<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> that "the sheep
    figured on the most ancient Egyptian monuments is unknown at the
    present day; and at least one variety of the bullock, formerly
    known in Egypt, has in like manner become extinct." So it has been
    with some animals and with several plants cultivated by the ancient
    inhabitants of Europe during the neolithic period. In Peru, Von
    Tschudi<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> found in certain tombs,
    apparently prior to the dynasty of the Incas, two kinds of maize
    not now known in the country. With our flowers and culinary
    vegetables, the production of new varieties and their extinction
    has incessantly recurred. At the present time improved breeds
    sometimes displace older breeds at an extraordinarily rapid rate;
    as has recently occurred throughout England with pigs. The Longhorn
    cattle in their native home were "suddenly swept away as if by some
    murderous pestilence," by the introduction of Shorthorns.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">What grand results have followed from the
    long-continued action of methodical and unconscious selection,
    regulated to a certain extent by natural selection, we see on every
    side of us. Compare the many animals and plants which are displayed
    at our exhibitions with their parent-forms when these are known, or
    consult old historical records with respect to their former state.
    Most of our domesticated animals have given rise to numerous and
    distinct races, but those which cannot be easily subjected to
    selection must be excepted&#8212;such as cats, the cochineal
    insect, and the hive-bee. In accordance with what we know of the
    process of selection, the formation of our many races has been slow
    and gradual. The man who first observed and preserved a pigeon with
    its oesophagus a little enlarged, its beak a little longer, or its
    tail a little more expanded than usual, never dreamed that he had
    made the first step in the creation of a pouter, carrier, and
    fantail-pigeon. Man can create not only anomalous breeds, but
    others having their whole structure admirably co-ordinated for
    certain purposes, such as the racehorse and dray-horse, or the
    greyhound and bulldog. It is by no means necessary that each small
    change of structure throughout the body, leading towards
    excellence, should simultaneously arise and be selected. Although
    man seldom attends to differences in organs which are important
    under a physiological point of view, yet he has so profoundly
    modified some breeds, that assuredly, if found wild, they would be
    ranked as distinct genera.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The best proof of what selection has effected is
    perhaps afforded by the fact that whatever part or quality in any
    animal, and more especially in any plant, is most valued by man,
    that part or quality differs most in the several races. This result
    is well seen by comparing the amount of difference between the
    fruits produced by the several varieties of fruit-trees, between
    the flowers of our flower-garden plants, between the seeds, roots,
    or leaves of our culinary and agricultural plants, in comparison
    with the other and not valued parts of the same varieties. Striking
    evidence of a different kind is afforded by the fact ascertained by
    Oswald Heer<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> namely, that the seeds
    of a large number of plants,&#8212;wheat, barley, oats, peas,
    beans, lentils, poppies,&#8212;cultivated for their seed by the
    ancient Lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, were all smaller than the
    seeds of our existing varieties. R&#252;timeyer has shown that the
    sheep and cattle which were kept by the earlier Lake-inhabitants
    were likewise smaller than our present breeds. In the middens of
    Denmark, the earliest dog of which the remains have been found was
    the weakest; this was succeeded during the Bronze age by a stronger
    kind, and this again during the Iron age by one still stronger. The
    sheep of Denmark during the Bronze period had extraordinarily
    slender limbs, and the horse was smaller than our present animal.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> No doubt in most of these cases the
    new and larger breeds were introduced from foreign lands by the
    immigration of new hordes of men. But it is not probable that each
    larger breed, which in the course of time has supplanted a previous
    and smaller breed, was the descendant of a distinct and larger
    species; it is far more probable that the domestic races of our
    various animals were gradually improved in different parts of the
    great Europaeo-Asiatic continent, and thence spread to other
    countries. This fact of the gradual increase in size of our
    domestic animals is all the more striking as certain wild or
    half-wild animals, such as red-deer, aurochs, park-cattle, and
    boars<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> have within nearly the same
    period decreased in size.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The conditions favourable to selection by man
    are,&#8212;the closest attention to every
    character,&#8212;long-continued perseverance,&#8212;facility in
    matching or separating animals,&#8212;and especially a large number
    being kept, so that the inferior individuals may be freely rejected
    or destroyed, and the better ones preserved. When many are kept
    there will also be a greater chance of the occurrence of
    well-marked deviations of structure. Length of time is
    all-important; for as each character, in order to become strongly
    pronounced, has to be augmented by the selection of successive
    variations of the same kind, this can be effected only during a
    long series of generations. Length of time will, also, allow any
    new feature to become fixed by the continued rejection of those
    individuals which revert or vary, and by the preservation of those
    which still inherit the new character. Hence, although some few
    animals have varied rapidly in certain respects under new
    conditions of life, as dogs in India and sheep in the West Indies,
    yet all the animals and plants which have produced strongly marked
    races were domesticated at an extremely remote epoch, often before
    the dawn of history. As a consequence of this, no record has been
    preserved of the origin of our chief domestic breeds. Even at the
    present day new strains or sub-breeds are formed so slowly that
    their first appearance passes unnoticed. A man attends to some
    particular character, or merely matches his animals with unusual
    care, and after a time a slight difference is perceived by his
    neighbours;&#8212;the difference goes on being augmented by
    unconscious and methodical selection, until at last a new sub-breed
    is formed, receives a local name, and spreads; but by this time its
    history is almost forgotten. When the new breed has spread widely,
    it gives rise to new strains and sub-breeds, and the best of these
    succeed and spread, supplanting other and older breeds; and so
    always onwards in the march of improvement.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When a well-marked breed has once been
    established, if not supplanted by still further improved
    sub-breeds, and if not exposed to greatly changed conditions of
    life inducing further variability or reversion to long-lost
    characters, it may apparently last for an enormous period. We may
    infer that this is the case from the high antiquity of certain
    races; but some caution is necessary on this head, for the same
    variation may appear independently after long intervals of time, or
    in distant places. We may safely assume that this has occurred with
    the turnspit-dog, of which one is figured on the ancient Egyptian
    monuments&#8212;with the solid-hoofed swine<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> mentioned by Aristotle&#8212;with
    five-toed fowls described by Columella&#8212;and certainly with the
    nectarine. The dogs represented on the Egyptian monuments, about
    2000 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>, show us that some of the chief breeds
    then existed, but it is extremely doubtful whether any are
    identically the same with our present breeds. A great mastiff
    sculptured on an Assyrian tomb, 640 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>, is said to
    be the same with the dog still imported from Thibet into the same
    region. The true greyhound existed during the Roman classical
    period. Coming down to a later period, we have seen that, though
    most of the chief breeds of the pigeon existed between two and
    three centuries ago, they have not all retained exactly the same
    character to the present day; but this has occurred in certain
    cases in which no improvement was desired, for instance, in the
    case of the Spot and Indian ground-tumbler.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">De Candolle<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
    has fully discussed the antiquity of various races of plants; he
    states that the black seeded poppy was known in the time of Homer,
    the white-seeded sesamum by the ancient Egyptians, and almonds with
    sweet and bitter kernels by the Hebrews; but it does not seem
    improbable that some of these varieties may have been lost and
    reappeared. One variety of barley and apparently one of wheat, both
    of which were cultivated at an immensely remote period by the
    Lake-inhabitants of Switzerland, still exist. It is said<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> that "specimens of a small variety of
    gourd which is still common in the market of Lima were exhumed from
    an ancient cemetery in Peru." De Candolle remarks that, in the
    books and drawings of the sixteenth century, the principal races of
    the cabbage, turnip, and gourd can be recognised: this might have
    been expected at so late a period, but whether any of these plants
    are absolutely identical with our present sub-varieties is not
    certain. It is, however, said that the Brussels sprout, a variety
    which in some places is liable to degeneration, has remained
    genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it is
    believed to have originated.<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In accordance with the views maintained by me in
    this work and elsewhere, not only the various domestic races, but
    the most distinct genera and orders within the same great
    class&#8212;for instance, mammals, birds, reptiles, and
    fishes&#8212;are all the descendants of one common progenitor, and
    we must admit that the whole vast amount of difference between
    these forms has primarily arisen from simple variability. To
    consider the subject under this point of view is enough to strike
    one dumb with amazement. But our amazement ought to be lessened
    when we reflect that beings almost infinite in number, during an
    almost infinite lapse of time, have often had their whole
    organisation rendered in some degree plastic, and that each slight
    modification of structure which was in any way beneficial under
    excessively complex conditions of life has been preserved, whilst
    each which was in any way injurious has been rigorously destroyed.
    And the long-continued accumulation of beneficial variations will
    infallibly have led to structures as diversified, as beautifully
    adapted for various purposes and as excellently co-ordinated, as we
    see in the animals and plants around us. Hence I have spoken of
    selection as the paramount power, whether applied by man to the
    formation of domestic breeds, or by nature to the production of
    species. I may recur to the metaphor given in a former chapter: if
    an architect were to rear a noble and commodious edifice, without
    the use of cut stone, by selecting from the fragments at the base
    of a precipice wedge-formed stones for his arches, elongated stones
    for his lintels, and flat stones for his roof, we should admire his
    skill and regard him as the paramount power. Now, the fragments of
    stone, though indispensable to the architect, bear to the edifice
    built by him the same relation which the fluctuating variations of
    organic beings bear to the varied and admirable structures
    ultimately acquired by their modified descendants.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some authors have declared that natural
    selection explains nothing, unless the precise cause of each slight
    individual difference be made clear. If it were explained to a
    savage utterly ignorant of the art of building, how the edifice had
    been raised stone upon stone, and why wedge-formed fragments were
    used for the arches, flat stones for the roof, etc.; and if the use
    of each part and of the whole building were pointed out, it would
    be unreasonable if he declared that nothing had been made clear to
    him, because the precise cause of the shape of each fragment could
    not be told. But this is a nearly parallel case with the objection
    that selection explains nothing, because we know not the cause of
    each individual difference in the structure of each being.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The shape of the fragments of stone at the base
    of our precipice may be called accidental, but this is not strictly
    correct; for the shape of each depends on a long sequence of
    events, all obeying natural laws; on the nature of the rock, on the
    lines of deposition or cleavage, on the form of the mountain, which
    depends on its upheaval and subsequent denudation, and lastly on
    the storm or earthquake which throws down the fragments. But in
    regard to the use to which the fragments may be put, their shape
    may be strictly said to be accidental. And here we are led to face
    a great difficulty, in alluding to which I am aware that I am
    travelling beyond my proper province. An omniscient Creator must
    have foreseen every consequence which results from the laws imposed
    by Him. But can it be reasonably maintained that the Creator
    intentionally ordered, if we use the words in any ordinary sense,
    that certain fragments of rock should assume certain shapes so that
    the builder might erect his edifice? If the various laws which have
    determined the shape of each fragment were not predetermined for
    the builder's sake, can it be maintained with any greater
    probability that He specially ordained for the sake of the breeder
    each of the innumerable variations in our domestic animals and
    plants;&#8212;many of these variations being of no service to man,
    and not beneficial, far more often injurious, to the creatures
    themselves? Did He ordain that the crop and tail-feathers of the
    pigeon should vary in order that the fancier might make his
    grotesque pouter and fantail breeds? Did He cause the frame and
    mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be
    formed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the
    bull for man's brutal sport? But if we give up the principle in one
    case,&#8212;if we do not admit that the variations of the primeval
    dog were intentionally guided in order that the greyhound, for
    instance, that perfect image of symmetry and vigour, might be
    formed,&#8212;no shadow of reason can be assigned for the belief
    that variations, alike in nature and the result of the same general
    laws, which have been the groundwork through natural selection of
    the formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world,
    man included, were intentionally and specially guided. However much
    we may wish it, we can hardly follow Professor Asa Gray in his
    belief "that variation has been led along certain beneficial
    lines," like a stream "along definite and useful lines of
    irrigation." If we assume that each particular variation was from
    the beginning of all time preordained, then that plasticity of
    organisation, which leads to many injurious deviations of
    structure, as well as the redundant power of reproduction which
    inevitably leads to a struggle for existence, and, as a
    consequence, to the natural selection or survival of the fittest,
    must appear to us superfluous laws of nature. On the other hand, an
    omnipotent and omniscient Creator ordains everything and foresees
    everything. Thus we are brought face to face with a difficulty as
    insoluble as is that of free will and predestination.</P>
