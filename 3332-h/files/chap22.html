    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We will now consider, as far as we can, the
    causes of the almost universal variability of our domesticated
    productions. The subject is an obscure one; but it may be useful to
    probe our ignorance. Some authors, for instance Dr. Prosper Lucas,
    look at variability as a necessary contingent on reproduction, and
    as much an aboriginal law as growth or inheritance. Others have of
    late encouraged, perhaps unintentionally, this view by speaking of
    inheritance and variability as equal and antagonistic principles.
    Pallas maintained, and he has had some followers, that variability
    depends exclusively on the crossing of primordially distinct forms.
    Other authors attribute variability to an excess of food, and with
    animals to an excess relatively to the amount of exercise taken, or
    again to the effects of a more genial climate. That these causes
    are all effective is highly probable. But we must, I think, take a
    broader view, and conclude that organic beings, when subjected
    during several generations to any change whatever in their
    conditions, tend to vary; the kind of variation which ensues
    depending in most cases in a far higher degree on the nature or
    constitution of the being, than on the nature of the changed
    conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Those authors who believe that it is a law of
    nature that each individual should differ in some slight degree
    from every other, may maintain, apparently with truth, that this is
    the fact, not only with all domesticated animals and cultivated
    plants, but likewise with all organic beings in a state of nature.
    The Laplander by long practice knows and gives a name to each
    reindeer, though, as Linn&#230;us remarks, "to distinguish one from
    another among such multitudes was beyond my comprehension, for they
    were like ants on an anthill." In Germany shepherds have won wagers
    by recognising each sheep in a flock of a hundred, which they had
    never seen until the previous fortnight. This power of
    discrimination, however, is as nothing compared to that which some
    florists have acquired. Verlot mentions a gardener who could
    distinguish 150 kinds of camellia, when not in flower; and it has
    been positively asserted that the famous old Dutch florist
    Voorhelm, who kept above 1200 varieties of the hyacinth, was hardly
    ever deceived in knowing each variety by the bulb alone. Hence we
    must conclude that the bulbs of the hyacinth and the branches and
    leaves of the camellia, though appearing to an unpractised eye
    absolutely undistinguishable, yet really differ.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As Linn&#230;us has compared the reindeer in
    number to ants, I may add that each ant knows its fellow of the
    same community. Several times I carried ants of the same species
    (<I>Formica rufa</I>) from one ant-hill to another, inhabited
    apparently by tens of thousands of ants; but the strangers were
    instantly detected and killed. I then put some ants taken from a
    very large nest into a bottle strongly perfumed with
    assaf&#339;tida, and after an interval of twenty-four hours
    returned them to their home; they were at first threatened by their
    fellows, but were soon recognised and allowed to pass. Hence each
    ant certainly recognised, independently of odour, its fellow; and
    if all the ants of the same community have not some countersign or
    watchword, they must present to each other's senses some
    distinguishable character.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The dissimilarity of brothers or sisters of the
    same family, and of seedlings from the same capsule, may be in part
    accounted for by the unequal blending of the characters of the two
    parents, and by the more or less complete recovery through
    reversion of ancestral characters on either side; but we thus only
    push the difficulty further back in time, for what made the parents
    or their progenitors different? Hence the belief<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> that an innate tendency to vary exists,
    independently of external differences, seems at first sight
    probable. But even the seeds nurtured in the same capsule are not
    subjected to absolutely uniform conditions, as they draw their
    nourishment from different points; and we shall see in a future
    chapter that this difference sometimes suffices to affect the
    character of the future plant. The greater dissimilarity of the
    successive children of the same family in comparison with twins,
    which often resemble each other in external appearance, mental
    disposition, and constitution, in so extraordinary a manner,
    apparently proves that the state of the parents at the exact period
    of conception, or the nature of the subsequent embryonic
    development, has a direct and powerful influence on the character
    of the offspring. Nevertheless, when we reflect on the individual
    differences between organic beings in a state of nature, as shown
    by every wild animal knowing its mate; and when we reflect on the
    infinite diversity of the many varieties of our domesticated
    productions, we may well be inclined to exclaim, though falsely as
    I believe, that Variability must be looked at as an ultimate fact,
    necessarily contingent on reproduction.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Those authors who adopt this latter view would
    probably deny that each separate variation has its own proper
    exciting cause. Although we can seldom trace the precise relation
    between cause and effect, yet the considerations presently to be
    given lead to the conclusion that each modification must have its
    own distinct cause, and is not the result of what we blindly call
    accident. The following striking case has been communicated to me
    by Dr. William Ogle. Two girls, born as twins, and in all respects
    extremely alike, had their little fingers on both hands crooked;
    and in both children the second bicuspid tooth of the second
    dentition on the right side in the upper jaw was misplaced; for,
    instead of standing in a line with the others, it grew from the
    roof of the mouth behind the first bicuspid. Neither the parents
    nor any other members of the family were known to have exhibited
    any similar peculiarity; but a son of one of these girls had the
    same tooth similarly misplaced. Now, as both the girls were
    affected in exactly the same manner, the idea of accident is at
    once excluded: and we are compelled to admit that there must have
    existed some precise and sufficient cause which, if it had occurred
    a hundred times, would have given crooked fingers and misplaced
    bicuspid teeth to a hundred children. It is of course possible that
    this case may have been due to reversion to some long-forgotten
    progenitor, and this would much weaken the value of the argument. I
    have been led to think of the probability of reversion, from having
    been told by Mr. Galton of another case of twin girls born with
    their little fingers slightly crooked, which they inherited from
    their maternal grandmother.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We will now consider the general arguments,
    which appear to me to have great weight, in favour of the view that
    variations of all kinds and degrees are directly or indirectly
    caused by the conditions of life to which each being, and more
    especially its ancestors, have been exposed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">No one doubts that domesticated productions are
    more variable than organic beings which have never been removed
    from their natural conditions. Monstrosities graduate so insensibly
    into mere variations that it is impossible to separate them; and
    all those who have studied monstrosities believe that they are far
    commoner with domesticated than with wild animals and plants;<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and in the case of plants,
    monstrosities would be equally noticeable in the natural as in the
    cultivated state. Under nature, the individuals of the same species
    are exposed to nearly uniform conditions, for they are rigorously
    kept to their proper places by a host of competing animals and
    plants; they have, also, long been habituated to their conditions
    of life; but it cannot be said that they are subject to quite
    uniform conditions, and they are liable to a certain amount of
    variation. The circumstances under which our domestic productions
    are reared are widely different: they are protected from
    competition; they have not only been removed from their natural
    conditions and often from their native land, but they are
    frequently carried from district to district, where they are
    treated differently, so that they rarely remain during any
    considerable length of time exposed to closely similar conditions.
    In conformity with this, all our domesticated productions, with the
    rarest exceptions, vary far more than natural species. The
    hive-bee, which feeds itself and follows in most respects its
    natural habits of life, is the least variable of all domesticated
    animals, and probably the goose is the next least variable; but
    even the goose varies more than almost any wild bird, so that it
    cannot be affiliated with perfect certainty to any natural species.
    Hardly a single plant can be named, which has long been cultivated
    and propagated by seed, that is not highly variable; common rye
    (<I>Secale cereale</I>) has afforded fewer and less marked
    varieties than almost any other cultivated plant;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> but it may be doubted whether the
    variations of this, the least valuable of all our cereals, have
    been closely observed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Bud-variation, which was fully discussed in a
    former chapter, shows us that variability may be quite independent
    of seminal reproduction, and likewise of reversion to long-lost
    ancestral characters. No one will maintain that the sudden
    appearance of a moss-rose on a Provence-rose is a return to a
    former state, for mossiness of the calyx has been observed in no
    natural species; the same argument is applicable to variegated and
    laciniated leaves; nor can the appearance of nectarines on
    peach-trees be accounted for on the principle of reversion. But
    bud-variations more immediately concern us, as they occur far more
    frequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a
    length of time, than on other and less highly cultivated plants;
    and very few well-marked instances have been observed with plants
    growing under strictly natural conditions. I have given one
    instance of an ash-tree growing in a gentleman's pleasure-grounds;
    and occasionally there may be seen, on beech and other trees, twigs
    leafing at a different period from the other branches. But our
    forest trees in England can hardly be considered as living under
    strictly natural conditions; the seedlings are raised and protected
    in nursery-grounds, and must often be transplanted into places
    where wild trees of the kind would not naturally grow. It would be
    esteemed a prodigy if a dog-rose growing in a hedge produced by
    bud-variation a moss-rose, or a wild bullace or wild cherry-tree
    yielded a branch bearing fruit of a different shape and colour from
    the ordinary fruit. The prodigy would be enhanced if these varying
    branches were found capable of propagation, not only by grafts, but
    sometimes by seed; yet analogous cases have occurred with many of
    our highly cultivated trees and herbs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These several considerations alone render it
    probable that variability of every kind is directly or indirectly
    caused by changed conditions of life. Or, to put the case under
    another point of view, if it were possible to expose all the
    individuals of a species during many generations to absolutely
    uniform conditions of life, there would be no variability.</P>

      <I>On the Nature of the Changes in the Conditions of Life which
      induce Variability.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From a remote period to the present day, under
    climates and circumstances as different as it is possible to
    conceive, organic beings of all kinds, when domesticated or
    cultivated, have varied. We see this with the many domestic races
    of quadrupeds and birds belonging to different orders, with
    goldfish and silkworms, with plants of many kinds, raised in
    various quarters of the world. In the deserts of northern Africa
    the date-palm has yielded thirty-eight varieties; in the fertile
    plains of India it is notorious how many varieties of rice and of a
    host of other plants exist; in a single Polynesian island,
    twenty-four varieties of the bread-fruit, the same number of the
    banana, and twenty-two varieties of the arum, are cultivated by the
    natives; the mulberry-tree in India and Europe has yielded many
    varieties serving as food for the silkworm; and in China
    sixty-three varieties of the bamboo are used for various domestic
    purposes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> xThese facts, and
    innumerable others which could be added, indicate that a change of
    almost any kind in the conditions of life suffices to cause
    variability&#8212;different changes acting on different
    organisms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Andrew Knight<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
    attributed the variation of both animals and plants to a more
    abundant supply of nourishment, or to a more favourable climate,
    than that natural to the species. A more genial climate, however,
    is far from necessary; the kidney-bean, which is often injured by
    our spring frosts, and peaches, which require the protection of a
    wall, have varied much in England, as has the orange-tree in
    northern Italy, where it is barely able to exist.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Nor can we overlook the fact, though not
    immediately connected with our present subject, that the plants and
    shells of the Arctic regions are eminently variable.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Moreover, it does not appear that a
    change of climate, whether more or less genial, is one of the most
    potent causes of variability; for in regard to plants Alph. De
    Candolle, in his 'G&#233;ographie Botanique' repeatedly shows that
    the native country of a plant, where in most cases it has been
    longest cultivated, is that where it has yielded the greatest
    number of varieties.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is doubtful whether a change in the nature of
    the food is a potent cause of variability. Scarcely any
    domesticated animal has varied more than the pigeon or the fowl,
    but their food, especially that of highly-bred pigeons, is
    generally the same. Nor can our cattle and sheep have been
    subjected to any great change in this respect. But in all these
    cases the food probably is much less varied in kind than that which
    was consumed by the species in its natural state.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Of all the causes which induce variability,
    excess of food, whether or not changed in nature, is probably the
    most powerful. This view was held with regard to plants by Andrew
    Knight, and is now held by Schleiden, more especially in reference
    to the inorganic elements of the food.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> In order to give a plant more food it
    suffices in most cases to grow it separately, and thus prevent
    other plants robbing its roots. It is surprising, as I have often
    seen, how vigorously our common wild species flourish when planted
    by themselves, though not in highly manured land; separate growth
    is, in fact, the first step in cultivation. We see the converse of
    the belief that excess of food induces variability in the following
    statement by a great raiser of seeds of all kinds:<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> "It is a rule invariably with us, when
    we desire to keep a true stock of any one kind of seed, to grow it
    on poor land without dung; but when we grow for quantity, we act
    contrary, and sometimes have dearly to repent of it." According
    also to Carri&#232;re, who has had great experience with
    flower-garden seeds, "On remarque en g&#233;n&#233;ral les plantes
    de vigeur moyenne sont celles qui conservent le mieux leurs
    caract&#232;res."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the case of animals the want of a proper
    amount of exercise, as Bechstein remarked, has perhaps played,
    independently of the direct effects of the disuse of any particular
    organ, an important part in causing variability. We can see in a
    vague manner that, when the organised and nutrient fluids of the
    body are not used during growth, or by the wear and tear of the
    tissues, they will be in excess; and as growth, nutrition, and
    reproduction are intimately allied processes, this superfluity
    might disturb the due and proper action of the reproductive organs,
    and consequently affect the character of the future offspring. But
    it may be argued that neither an excess of food nor a superfluity
    in the organised fluids of the body necessarily induces
    variability. The goose and the turkey have been well fed for many
    generations, yet have varied very little. Our fruit-trees and
    culinary plants, which are so variable, have been cultivated from
    an ancient period, and, though they probably still receive more
    nutriment than in their natural state, yet they must have received
    during many generations nearly the same amount; and it might be
    thought that they would have become habituated to the excess.
    Nevertheless, on the whole, Knight's view, that excess of food is
    one of the most potent causes of variability, appears, as far as I
    can judge, probable.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not our various cultivated plants
    have received nutriment in excess, all have been exposed to changes
    of various kinds. Fruit-trees are grafted on different stocks, and
    grown in various soils. The seeds of culinary and agricultural
    plants are carried from place to place; and during the last century
    the rotation of our crops and the manures used have been greatly
    changed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Slight changes of treatment often suffice to
    induce variability. The simple fact of almost all our cultivated
    plants and domesticated animals having varied in all places and at
    all times, leads to this conclusion. Seeds taken from common
    English forest-trees, grown under their native climate, not highly
    manured or otherwise artificially treated, yield seedlings which
    vary much, as may be seen in every extensive seed-bed. I have shown
    in a former chapter what a number of well-marked and singular
    varieties the thorn (<I>Crat&#230;gus oxycantha</I>) has produced:
    yet this tree has been subjected to hardly any cultivation. In
    Staffordshire I carefully examined a large number of two British
    plants, namely <I>Geranium ph&#230;um</I> and <I>pyrenaicum,</I>
    which have never been highly cultivated. These plants had spread
    spontaneously by seed from a common garden into an open plantation;
    and the seedlings varied in almost every single character, both in
    their flower and foliage, to a degree which I have never seen
    exceeded; yet they could not have been exposed to any great change
    in their conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to animals, Azara has remarked with
    much surprise<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> that, whilst the
    feral horses on the Pampas are always of one of three colours, and
    the cattle always of a uniform colour, yet these animals, when bred
    on the unenclosed estancias, though kept in a state which can
    hardly be called domesticated, and apparently exposed to almost
    identically the same conditions as when they are feral,
    nevertheless display a great diversity of colour. So again in India
    several species of fresh-water fish are only so far treated
    artificially, that they are reared in great tanks; but this small
    change is sufficient to induce much variability.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some facts on the effects of grafting, in regard
    to the variability of trees, deserve attention. Cabanis asserts
    that when certain pears are grafted on the quince, their seeds
    yield a greater number of varieties than do the seeds of the same
    variety of pear when grafted on the wild pear.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> But as the pear and quince are distinct
    species, though so closely related that the one can be readily
    grafted and succeeds admirably on the other, the fact of
    variability being thus caused is not surprising; as we are here
    enabled to see the cause, namely, the very different nature of the
    stock and graft. Several North American varieties of the plum and
    peach are well known to reproduce themselves truly by seed; but
    Downing asserts,<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> "that when a
    graft is taken from one of these trees and placed upon another
    stock, this grafted tree is found to lose its singular property of
    producing the same variety by seed, and becomes like all other
    worked trees;"&#8212;that is, its seedlings become highly variable.
    Another case is worth giving: the Lalande variety of the
    walnut-tree leafs between April 20th and May 15th, and its
    seedlings invariably inherit the same habit; whilst several other
    varieties of the walnut leaf in June. Now, if seedlings are raised
    from the May-leafing Lalande variety, grafted on another
    May-leafing variety, though both stock and graft have the same
    early habit of leafing, yet the seedlings leaf at various times,
    even as late as the 5th of June.<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
    Such facts as these are well fitted to show on what obscure and
    slight causes variability depends.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I may here just allude to the appearance
    of new and valuable varieties of fruit-trees and of wheat in woods
    and waste places, which at first sight seems a most anomalous
    circumstance. In France a considerable number of the best pears
    have been discovered in woods; and this has occurred so frequently,
    that Poiteau asserts that "improved varieties of our cultivated
    fruits rarely originate with nurserymen."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> In England, on the other hand, no
    instance of a good pear having been found wild has been recorded;
    and Mr. Rivers informs me that he knows of only one instance with
    apples, namely, the Bess Poole, which was discovered in a wood in
    Nottinghamshire. This difference between the two countries may be
    in part accounted for by the more favourable climate of France, but
    chiefly from the great number of seedlings which spring up there in
    the woods. I infer that this is the case from a remark made by a
    French gardener,<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> who regards it
    as a national calamity that such a number of pear-trees are
    periodically cut down for firewood, before they have borne fruit.
    The new varieties which thus spring up in the woods, though they
    cannot have received any excess of nutriment, will have been
    exposed to abruptly changed conditions, but whether this is the
    cause of their production is very doubtful. These varieties,
    however, are probably all descended<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> from old cultivated kinds growing in
    adjoining orchards&#8212; a circumstance which will account for
    their variability; and out of a vast number of varying trees there
    will always be a good chance of the appearance of a valuable kind.
    In North America, where fruit-trees frequently spring up in waste
    places, the Washington pear was found in a hedge, and the Emperor
    peach in a wood.<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to wheat, some writers have
    spoken<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> as if it were an ordinary
    event for new varieties to be found in waste places; the Fenton
    wheat was certainly discovered growing on a pile of basaltic
    detritus in a quarry, but in such a situation the plant would
    probably receive a sufficient amount of nutriment. The Chidham
    wheat was raised from an ear found <I>on</I> a hedge; and Hunter's
    wheat was discovered <I>by</I> the roadside in Scotland, but it is
    not said that this latter variety grew where it was found.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whether our domestic productions would ever
    become so completely habituated to the conditions under which they
    now live, as to cease varying, we have no sufficient means for
    judging. But, in fact, our domestic productions are never exposed
    for a great length of time to uniform conditions, and it is certain
    that our most anciently cultivated plants, as well as animals,
    still go on varying, for all have recently undergone marked
    improvement. In some few cases, however, plants have become
    habituated to new conditions. Thus, Metzger, who cultivated in
    Germany during many years numerous varieties of wheat, brought from
    different countries,<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> states that
    some kinds were at first extremely variable, but gradually, in one
    instance after an interval of twenty-five years, became constant;
    and it does not appear that this resulted from the selection of the
    more constant forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the Accumulative Action of changed
    Conditions of Life.</I>&#8212;We have good grounds for believing
    that the influence of changed conditions accumulates, so that no
    effect is produced on a species until it has been exposed during
    several generations to continued cultivation or domestication.
    Universal experience shows us that when new flowers are first
    introduced into our gardens they do not vary; but ultimately all,
    with the rarest exceptions, vary to a greater or less extent. In a
    few cases the requisite number of generations, as well as the
    successive steps in the progress of variation, have been recorded,
    as in the often quoted instance of the Dahlia.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> After several years' culture the Zinnia
    has only lately (1860) begun to vary in any great degree. "In the
    first seven or eight years of high cultivation, the Swan River
    daisy (<I>Brachycome iberidifolia</I>) kept to its original colour;
    it then varied into lilac and purple and other minor shades."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> Analogous facts have been recorded
    with the Scotch rose. In discussing the variability of plants
    several experienced horticulturists have spoken to the same general
    effect. Mr. Salter<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> remarks,
    "Every one knows that the chief difficulty is in breaking through
    the original form and colour of the species, and every one will be
    on the look-out for any natural sport, either from seed or branch;
    that being once obtained, however trifling the change may be, the
    result depends upon himself." M. de Jonghe, who has had so much
    success in raising new varieties of pears and strawberries,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> remarks with respect to the former,
    "There is another principle, namely, that the more a type has
    entered into a state of variation, the greater is its tendency to
    continue doing so; and the more it has varied from the original
    type, the more it is disposed to vary still farther." We have,
    indeed, already discussed this latter point when treating of the
    power which man possesses, through selection, of continually
    augmenting in the same direction each modification; for this power
    depends on continued variability of the same general kind. The most
    celebrated horticulturist in France, namely, Vilmorin,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> even maintains that, when any particular
    variation is desired, the first step is to get the plant to vary in
    any manner whatever, and to go on selecting the most variable
    individuals, even though they vary in the wrong direction; for the
    fixed character of the species being once broken, the desired
    variation will sooner or later appear.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As nearly all our animals were domesticated at
    an extremely remote epoch, we cannot, of course, say whether they
    varied quickly or slowly when first subjected to new conditions.
    But Dr. Bachman<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> states that he
    has seen turkeys raised from the eggs of the wild species lose
    their metallic tints and become spotted with white in the third
    generation. Mr. Yarrell many years ago informed me that the wild
    ducks bred on the ponds in St. James's Park, which had never been
    crossed, as it is believed, with domestic ducks, lost their true
    plumage after a few generations. An excellent observer,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> who has often reared ducks from the eggs
    of the wild bird, and who took precautions that there should be no
    crossing with domestic breeds, has given, as previously stated,
    full details on the changes which they gradually undergo. He found
    that he could not breed these wild ducks true for more than five or
    six generations, "as they then proved so much less beautiful. The
    white collar round the neck of the mallard became much broader and
    more irregular, and white feathers appeared in the ducklings'
    wings." They increased also in size of body; their legs became less
    fine, and they lost their elegant carriage. Fresh eggs were then
    procured from wild birds; but again the same result followed. In
    these cases of the duck and turkey we see that animals, like
    plants, do not depart from their primitive type until they have
    been subjected during several generations to domestication. On the
    other hand, Mr. Yarrell informed me that the Australian dingos,
    bred in the Zoological Gardens, almost invariably produced in the
    first generation puppies marked with white and other colours; but,
    these introduced dingos had probably been procured from the
    natives, who keep them in a semi-domesticated state. It is
    certainly a remarkable fact that changed conditions should at first
    produce, as far as we can see, absolutely no effect; but that they
    should subsequently cause the character of the species to change.
    In the chapter on pangenesis I shall attempt to throw a little
    light on this fact.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Returning now to the causes which are supposed
    to induce variability. Some authors<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> believe that close interbreeding gives
    this tendency, and leads to the production of monstrosities. In the
    seventeenth chapter some few facts were advanced, showing that
    monstrosities are, as it appears, occasionally thus induced; and
    there can be no doubt that close interbreeding causes lessened
    fertility and a weakened constitution; hence it may lead to
    variability: but I have not sufficient evidence on this head. On
    the other hand, close interbreeding, if not carried to an injurious
    extreme, far from causing variability, tends to fix the character
    of each breed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It was formerly a common belief, still held by
    some persons, that the imagination of the mother affects the child
    in the womb.<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> This view is
    evidently not applicable to the lower animals, which lay
    unimpregnated eggs, or to plants. Dr. William Hunter, in the last
    century, told my father that during many years every woman in a
    large London Lying-in Hospital was asked before her confinement
    whether anything had specially affected her mind, and the answer
    was written down; and it so happened that in no one instance could
    a coincidence be detected between the woman's answer and any
    abnormal structure; but when she knew the nature of the structure,
    she frequently suggested some fresh cause. The belief in the power
    of the mother's imagination may perhaps have arisen from the
    children of a second marriage resembling the previous father, as
    certainly sometimes occurs, in accordance with the facts given in
    the eleventh chapter.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Crossing as a Cause of
    Variability.</I>&#8212;In an early part of this chapter it was
    stated that Pallas<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> and a few
    other naturalists maintain that variability is wholly due to
    crossing. If this means that new characters never spontaneously
    appear in our domestic races, but that they are all directly
    derived from certain aboriginal species, the doctrine is little
    less than absurd; for it implies that animals like Italian
    greyhounds, pug-dogs, bull-dogs, pouter and fantail pigeons, etc.,
    were able to exist in a state of nature. But the doctrine may mean
    something widely different, namely, that the crossing of distinct
    species is the sole cause of the first appearance of new
    characters, and that without this aid man could not have formed his
    various breeds. As, however, new characters have appeared in
    certain cases by bud-variation, we may conclude with certainty that
    crossing is not necessary for variability. It is, moreover, certain
    that the breeds of various animals, such as of the rabbit, pigeon,
    duck, etc., and the varieties of several plants, are the modified
    descendants of a single wild species. Nevertheless, it is probable
    that the crossing of two forms, when one or both have long been
    domesticated or cultivated, adds to the variability of the
    offspring, independently of the commingling of the characters
    derived from the two parent-forms; and this implies that new
    characters actually arise. But we must not forget the facts
    advanced in the thirteenth chapter, which clearly prove that the
    act of crossing often leads to the reappearance or reversion of
    long-lost characters; and in most cases it would be impossible to
    distinguish between the reappearance of ancient characters and the
    first appearance of absolutely new characters. Practically, whether
    new or old, they would be new to the breed in which they
    reappeared.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>G&#228;rtner declares,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> and his experience is of the highest
    value on such a point, that, when he crossed native plants which
    had not been cultivated, he never once saw in the offspring any new
    character; but that from the odd manner in which the characters
    derived from the parents were combined, they sometimes appeared as
    if new. When, on the other hand, he crossed cultivated plants, he
    admits that new characters occasionally appeared, but he is
    strongly inclined to attribute their appearance to ordinary
    variability, not in any way to the cross. An opposite conclusion,
    however, appears to me the more probable. According to
    K&#246;lreuter, hybrids in the genus Mirabilis vary almost
    infinitely, and he describes new and singular characters in the
    form of the seeds, in the colour of the anthers, in the cotyledons
    being of immense size, in new and highly peculiar odours, in the
    flowers expanding early in the season, and in their closing at
    night. With respect to one lot of these hybrids, he remarks that
    they presented characters exactly the reverse of what might have
    been expected from their parentage.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Prof. Lecoq<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> speaks strongly to the same effect in
    regard to this same genus, and asserts that many of the hybrids
    from <I>Mirabilis jalapa</I> and <I>multiflora</I> might easily be
    mistaken for distinct species, and adds that they differed in a
    greater degree than the other species of the genus, from <I>M.
    jalapa.</I> Herbert, also, has described<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> certain hybrid Rhododendrons as being
    "as <I>unlike all others</I> in foliage, as if they had been a
    separate species." The common experience of floriculturists proves
    that the crossing and recrossing of distinct but allied plants,
    such as the species of Petunia, Calceolaria, Fuchsia, Verbena,
    etc., induces excessive variability; hence the appearance of quite
    new characters is probable. M. Carri&#232;re<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> has lately discussed this subject: he
    states that <I>Erythrina cristagalli</I> had been multiplied by
    seed for many years, but had not yielded any varieties: it was then
    crossed with the allied <I>E. herbacea,</I> and "the resistance was
    now overcome, and varieties were produced with flowers of extremely
    different size, form, and colour."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From the general and apparently
    well-founded belief that the crossing of distinct species, besides
    commingling their characters, adds greatly to their variability, it
    has probably arisen that some botanists have gone so far as to
    maintain<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> that, when a genus
    includes only a single species, this when cultivated never varies.
    The proposition made so broadly cannot be admitted; but it is
    probably true that the variability of monotypic genera when
    cultivated is generally less than that of genera including numerous
    species, and this quite independently of the effects of crossing. I
    have shown in my 'Origin of Species' that the species belonging to
    small genera generally yield a less number of varieties in a state
    of nature than those belonging to large genera. Hence the species
    of small genera would, it is probable, produce fewer varieties
    under cultivation than the already variable species of larger
    genera.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although we have not at present
    sufficient evidence that the crossing of species, which have never
    been cultivated, leads to the appearance of new characters, this
    apparently does occur with species which have been already rendered
    in some degree variable through cultivation. Hence crossing, like
    any other change in the conditions of life, seems to be an element,
    probably a potent one, in causing variability. But we seldom have
    the means of distinguishing, as previously remarked, between the
    appearance of really new characters and the reappearance of
    long-lost characters, evoked through the act of crossing. I will
    give an instance of the difficulty in distinguishing such cases.
    The species of Datura may be divided into two sections, those
    having white flowers with green stems, and those having purple
    flowers with brown stems: now Naudin<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> crossed <I>Datura l&#230;vis</I> and <I>
    ferox,</I> both of which belong to the white section, and raised
    from them 205 hybrids. Of these hybrids, every one had brown stems
    and bore purple flowers; so that they resembled the species of the
    other section of the genus, and not their own two parents. Naudin
    was so much astonished at this fact, that he was led carefully to
    observe both parent-species, and he discovered that the pure
    seedlings of <I>D. ferox,</I> immediately after germination, had
    dark purple stems, extending from the young roots up to the
    cotyledons, and that this tint remained ever afterwards as a ring
    round the base of the stem of the plant when old. Now I have shown
    in the thirteenth chapter that the retention or exaggeration of an
    early character is so intimately related to reversion, that it
    evidently comes under the same principle. Hence probably we ought
    to look at the purple flowers and brown stems of these hybrids, not
    as new characters due to variability, but as a return to the former
    state of some ancient progenitor.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Independently of the appearance of new
    characters from crossing, a few words may be added to what has been
    said in former chapters on the unequal combination and transmission
    of the characters proper to the two parent-forms. When two species
    or races are crossed, the offspring of the first generation are
    generally uniform, but those subsequently produced display an
    almost infinite diversity of character. He who wishes, says
    K&#246;lreuter,<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> to obtain an
    endless number of varieties from hybrids should cross and recross
    them. There is also much variability when hybrids or mongrels are
    reduced or absorbed by repeated crosses with either pure
    parent-form: and a still higher degree of variability when three
    distinct species, and most of all when four species, are blended
    together by successive crosses. Beyond this point G&#228;rtner,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> on whose authority the foregoing
    statements are made, never succeeded in effecting a union; but Max
    Wichura<A href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> united six distinct
    species of willows into a single hybrid. The sex of the parent
    species affects in an inexplicable manner the degree of variability
    of hybrids; for G&#228;rtner<A href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
    repeatedly found that when a hybrid was used as a father and either
    one of the pure parent-species, or a third species, was used as the
    mother, the offspring were more variable than when the same hybrid
    was used as the mother, and either pure parent or the same third
    species as the father: thus seedlings from <I>Dianthus barbatus</I>
    crossed by the hybrid <I>D. chinensi-barbatus</I> were more
    variable than those raised from this latter hybrid fertilised by
    the pure <I>D. barbatus.</I> Max Wichura<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> insists strongly on an analogous result
    with his hybrid willows. Again G&#228;rtner<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> asserts that the degree of variability
    sometimes differs in hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses between
    the same two species; and here the sole difference is, that the one
    species is first used as the father and then as the mother. On the
    whole we see that, independently of the appearance of new
    characters, the variability of successive crossed generations is
    extremely complex, partly from the offspring partaking unequally of
    the characters of the two parent-forms, and more especially from
    their unequal tendency to revert to such characters or to those of
    more ancient progenitors.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the Manner and on the Period of Action of
    the Causes which induce Variability.</I>&#8212;This is an extremely
    obscure subject, and we need here only consider, whether inherited
    variations are due to certain parts being acted on after they have
    been formed, or through the reproductive system being affected
    before their formation; and in the former case at what period of
    growth or development the effect is produced. We shall see in the
    two following chapters that various agencies, such as an abundant
    supply of food, exposure to a different climate, increased use or
    disuse of parts, etc., prolonged during several generations,
    certainly modify either the whole organisation or certain organs;
    and it is clear at least in the case of bud-variation that the
    action cannot have been through the reproductive system.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the part which the
    reproductive system takes in causing variability, we have seen in
    the eighteenth chapter that even slight changes in the conditions
    of life have a remarkable power in causing a greater or less degree
    of sterility. Hence it seems not improbable that beings generated
    through a system so easily affected should themselves be affected,
    or should fail to inherit, or inherit in excess, characters proper
    to their parents. We know that certain groups of organic beings,
    but with exceptions in each group, have their reproductive systems
    much more easily affected by changed conditions than other groups;
    for instance, carnivorous birds, more readily than carnivorous
    mammals, and parrots more readily than pigeons; and this fact
    harmonises with the apparently capricious manner and degree in
    which various groups of animals and plants vary under
    domestication.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>K&#246;lreuter<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> was struck with the parallelism between
    the excessive variability of hybrids when crossed and recrossed in
    various ways,&#8212;these hybrids having their reproductive powers
    more or less affected,&#8212;and the variability of anciently
    cultivated plants. Max Wichura<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
    has gone one step farther, and shows that with many of our highly
    cultivated plants, such as the hyacinth, tulip, auricula,
    snapdragon, potato, cabbage, etc., which there is no reason to
    believe have been hybridised, the anthers contain many irregular
    pollen-grains in the same state as in hybrids. He finds also in
    certain wild forms, the same coincidence between the state of the
    pollen and a high degree of variability, as in many species of
    Rubus; but in R. caesius and idaeus, which are not highly variable
    species, the pollen is sound. It is also notorious that many
    cultivated plants, such as the banana, pineapple, bread-fruit, and
    others previously mentioned, have their reproductive organs so
    seriously affected as to be generally quite sterile; and when they
    do yield seed, the seedlings, judging from the large number of
    cultivated races which exist, must be variable in an extreme
    degree. These facts indicate that there is some relation between
    the state of the reproductive organs and a tendency to variability;
    but we must not conclude that the relation is strict. Although many
    of our highly cultivated plants may have their pollen in a
    deteriorated condition, yet, as we have previously seen, they yield
    more seeds, and our anciently domesticated animals are more
    prolific, than the corresponding species in a state of nature. The
    peacock is almost the only bird which is believed to be less
    fertile under domestication than in its native state, and it has
    varied in a remarkably small degree. From these considerations it
    would seem that changes in the conditions of life lead either to
    sterility or to variability, or to both; and not that sterility
    induces variability. On the whole it is probable that any cause
    affecting the organs of reproduction would likewise affect their
    product,&#8212;that is, the offspring thus generated.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The period of life at which the causes
    that induce variability act, is likewise an obscure subject, which
    has been discussed by various authors.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> In some of the cases, to be given in the
    following chapter, of modifications from the direct action of
    changed conditions, which are inherited, there can be no doubt that
    the causes have acted on the mature or nearly mature animal. On the
    other hand, monstrosities, which cannot be distinctly separated
    from lesser variations, are often caused by the embryo being
    injured whilst in the mother's womb or in the egg. Thus I. Geoffroy
    Saint-Hilaire<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> asserts that poor
    women who work hard during their pregnancy, and the mothers of
    illegitimate children troubled in their minds and forced to conceal
    their state, are far more liable to give birth to monsters than
    women in easy circumstances. The eggs of the fowl when placed
    upright or otherwise treated unnaturally frequently produce
    monstrous chickens. It would, however, appear that complex
    monstrosities are induced more frequently during a rather late than
    during a very early period of embryonic life; but this may partly
    result from some one part, which has been injured during an early
    period, affecting by its abnormal growth other parts subsequently
    developed; and this would be less likely to occur with parts
    injured at a later period.<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> When
    any part or organ becomes monstrous through abortion, a rudiment is
    generally left, and this likewise indicates that its development
    had already commenced.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Insects sometimes have their antennae or
    legs in a monstrous condition, the larvae of which do not possess
    either antennae or legs; and in these cases, as Quatrefages<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> believes, we are enabled to see the
    precise period at which the normal progress of development was
    troubled. But the nature of the food given to a caterpillar
    sometimes affects the colours of the moth, without the caterpillar
    itself being affected; therefore it seems possible that other
    characters in the mature insect might be indirectly modified
    through the larvae. There is no reason to suppose that organs which
    have been rendered monstrous have always been acted on during their
    development; the cause may have acted on the organisation at a much
    earlier stage. It is even probable that either the male or female
    sexual elements, or both, before their union, may be affected in
    such a manner as to lead to modifications in organs developed at a
    late period of life; in nearly the same manner as a child may
    inherit from his father a disease which does not appear until old
    age.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In accordance with the facts above given,
    which prove that in many cases a close relation exists between
    variability and the sterility following from changed conditions, we
    may conclude that the exciting cause often acts at the earliest
    possible period, namely, on the sexual elements, before
    impregnation has taken place. That an affection of the female
    sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as
    probable from the occurrence of bud-variations; for a bud seems to
    be the analogue of an ovule. But the male element is apparently
    much oftener affected by changed conditions, at least in a visible
    manner, than the female element or ovule and we know from
    G&#228;rtner's and Wichura's statements that a hybrid used as the
    father and crossed with a pure species gives a greater degree of
    variability to the offspring, than does the same hybrid when used
    as the mother. Lastly, it is certain that variability may be
    transmitted through either sexual element, whether or not
    originally excited in them, for K&#246;lreuter and G&#228;rtner<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> found that when two species were
    crossed, if either one was variable, the offspring were rendered
    variable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Summary.</I>&#8212;From the facts given in
    this chapter, we may conclude that the variability of organic
    beings under domestication, although so general, is not an
    inevitable contingent on life, but results from the conditions to
    which the parents have been exposed. Changes of any kind in the
    conditions of life, even extremely slight changes, often suffice to
    cause variability. Excess of nutriment is perhaps the most
    efficient single exciting cause. Animals and plants continue to be
    variable for an immense period after their first domestication; but
    the conditions to which they are exposed never long remain quite
    constant. In the course of time they can be habituated to certain
    changes, so as to become less variable; and it is possible that
    when first domesticated they may have been even more variable than
    at present. There is good evidence that the power of changed
    conditions accumulates; so that two, three, or more generations
    must be exposed to new conditions before any effect is visible. The
    crossing of distinct forms, which have already become variable,
    increases in the offspring the tendency to further variability, by
    the unequal commingling of the characters of the two parents, by
    the reappearance of long-lost characters, and by the appearance of
    absolutely new characters. Some variations are induced by the
    direct action of the surrounding conditions on the whole
    organisation, or on certain parts alone; other variations appear to
    be induced indirectly through the reproductive system being
    affected, as we know is often the case with various beings, which
    when removed from their natural conditions become sterile. The
    causes which induce variability act on the mature organism, on the
    embryo, and, probably, on the sexual elements before impregnation
    has been effected.</P>

      1662. With respect to the similarity of twins in constitution,
      Dr. William Ogle has given me the following extract from
      Professor Trousseau's Lectures ('Clinique M&#233;dicale,' tom.
      i.1 p. 523), in which a curious case is recorded:&#8212;"J'ai
      donn&#233; mes soins &#224; deux fr&#232;res jumeaux, tous deux
      si extraordinairement ressemblants qu'il m'&#233;tait impossible
      de les reconnaitre, &#224; moin de les voir l'un &#224;
      c&#244;t&#233; de l'autre. Cette ressemblance physique
      s'&#233;tendait plus loin: ils avaient, permettez-moi
      l'expression, une similitude pathologique plus remarquable
      encore. Ainsi l'un d'eux que je voyais aux n&#233;othermes &#224;
      Paris malade d'une ophthalmie rhumatismale me disait, 'En ce
      moment mon frere doit avoir une ophthalmie comme la mienne;' et
      comme je m'etais recrie, il me montrait quelques jours apres une
      lettre qu'il venait de recevoir de ce fr&#232;re alors &#224;
      Vienne, et qui lui &#233;crivait en effet&#8212;'J'ai mon
      ophthalmie, tu dois avoir la tienne.' Quelque singulier que ceci
      puisse para&#238;tre, le fait n'en est pas moins exact: on ne me
      l'a pas racont&#233;, je l'ai vu, et j'en ai vu d'autres
      analogues dans ma pratique. Ces deux jumeaux &#233;taient aussi
      tous deux asthmatiques, et asthmatiques a un effroyable
      degr&#233;. Originaires de Marseille, ils n'ont jamais pu
      demeurer dans cette ville, ou leurs int&#233;r&#234;ts les
      appelaient souvent, sans etre pris de leurs acces; jamais ils
      n'en eprouvaient a Paris. Bien mieux, il leur suffisait de gagner
      Toulon pour &#234;tre gu&#233;ris de leurs attaques de Marseille.
      Voyageant sans cesse et dans tous pays pour leurs affaires, ils
      avaient remarque que certaines localit&#233;s leur &#233;taient
      funestes, que dans d'autres ils etaient exempts de tout
      ph&#233;nom&#232;ne d'oppression."</FONT></LI>
