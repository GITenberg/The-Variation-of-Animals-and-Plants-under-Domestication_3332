    <P align="JUSTIFY">The history of the Horse is lost in antiquity.
    Remains of this animal in a domesticated condition have been found
    in the Swiss lake-dwellings, belonging to the Neolithic period.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> At the present time the number of
    breeds is great, as may be seen by consulting any treatise on the
    Horse.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Looking only to the native
    ponies of Great Britain, those of the Shetland Isles, Wales, the
    New Forest, and Devonshire are distinguishable; and so it is,
    amongst other instances, with each separate island in the great
    Malay archipelago.<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> Some of the
    breeds present great differences in size, shape of ears, length of
    mane, proportions of the body, form of the withers and hind
    quarters, and especially in the head. Compare the race-horse,
    dray-horse, and a Shetland pony in size, configuration, and
    disposition; and see how much greater the difference is than
    between the seven or eight other living species of the genus
    Equus.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Of individual variations not known to
    characterise particular breeds, and not great or injurious enough
    to be called monstrosities, I have not collected many cases. Mr. G.
    Brown, of the Cirencester Agricultural College, who has
    particularly attended to the dentition of our domestic animals,
    writes to me that he has "several times noticed eight permanent
    incisors instead of six in the jaw." Male horses only should have
    canines, but they are occasionally found in the mare, though a
    small size.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> The number of ribs on
    each side is properly eighteen, but Youatt<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> asserts that not unfrequently there are
    nineteen, the additional one being always the posterior rib. It is
    a remarkable fact that the ancient Indian horse is said in the
    Rig-V&#234;da to have only seventeen ribs; and M.
    Pi&#233;trement,<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> who has called
    attention to this subject, gives various reasons for placing full
    trust in this statement, more especially as during former times the
    Hindoos carefully counted the bones of animals. I have seen several
    notices of variations in the bones of the leg; thus Mr. Price<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> speaks of an additional bone in the
    hock, and of certain abnormal appearances between the tibia and
    astragalus, as quite common in Irish horses, and not due to
    disease. Horses have often been observed, according to M. Gaudry,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> to possess a trapezium and a
    rudiment of a fifth metacarpal bone, so that "one sees appearing by
    monstrosity, in the foot of the horse, structures which normally
    exist in the foot of the Hipparion,"&#8212;an allied and extinct
    animal. In various countries horn-like projections have been
    observed on the frontal bones of the horse: in one case described
    by Mr. Percival they arose about two inches above the orbital
    processes, and were "very like those in a calf from five to six
    months old," being from half to three-quarters of an inch in
    length.<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Azara has described two
    cases in South America in which the projections were between three
    and four inches in length: other instances have occurred in
    Spain.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That there has been much inherited variation in
    the horse cannot be doubted, when we reflect on the number of the
    breeds existing throughout the world or even within the same
    country, and when we know that they have largely increased in
    number since the earliest known records.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Even in so fleeting a character as
    colour, Hofacker<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> found that, out
    of 216 cases in which horses of the same colour were paired, only
    eleven pairs produced foals of a quite different colour. As
    Professor Low<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> has remarked, the
    English race-horse offers the best possible evidence of
    inheritance. The pedigree of a race-horse is of more value in
    judging of its probable success than its appearance: "King Herod"
    gained in prizes 201,505 pounds sterling, and begot 497 winners;
    "Eclipse" begot 334 winners.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whether the whole amount of difference between
    the various breeds has arisen under domestication is doubtful. From
    the fertility of the most distinct breeds<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> when crossed, naturalists have generally
    looked at all the breeds as having descended from a single species.
    Few will agree with Colonel H. Smith, who believes that they have
    descended from no less than five primitive and differently coloured
    stocks.<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> But as several species
    and varieties of the horse existed<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> during the later tertiary periods, and
    as Rutimeyer found differences in the size and form of the skull in
    the earliest known domesticated horses,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> we ought not to feel sure that all our
    breeds are descended from a single species. The savages of North
    and South America easily reclaim the feral horses, so that there is
    no improbability in savages in various quarters of the world having
    domesticated more than one native species or natural race. M.
    Sanson<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> thinks that he has proved
    that two distinct species have been domesticated, one in the East,
    and one in North Africa; and that these differed in the number of
    their lumbar vertebra and in various other parts; but M. Sanson
    seems to believe that osteological characters are subject to very
    little variation, which is certainly a mistake. At present no
    aboriginal or truly wild horse is positively known to exist; for it
    is commonly believed that the wild horses of the East are escaped
    domestic animals.<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> If therefore
    our domestic breeds are descended from several species or natural
    races, all have become extinct in the wild state.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the causes of the modifications
    which horses have undergone, the conditions of life seem to produce
    a considerable direct effect. Mr. D. Forbes, who has had excellent
    opportunities of comparing the horses of Spain with those of South
    America, informs me that the horses of Chile, which have lived
    under nearly the same conditions as their progenitors in Andalusia,
    remain unaltered, whilst the Pampas horses and the Puno horses are
    considerably modified. There can be no doubt that horses become
    greatly reduced in size and altered in appearance by living on
    mountains and islands; and this apparently is due to want of
    nutritious or varied food. Every one knows how small and rugged the
    ponies are on the Northern islands and on the mountains of Europe.
    Corsica and Sardinia have their native ponies; and there were,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> or still are, on some islands on
    the coast of Virginia, ponies like those of the Shetland Islands,
    which are believed to have originated through exposure to
    unfavourable conditions. The Puno ponies, which inhabit the lofty
    regions of the Cordillera, are, as I hear from Mr. D. Forbes,
    strange little creatures, very unlike their Spanish progenitors.
    Further south, in the Falkland Islands, the offspring of the horses
    imported in 1764 have already so much deteriorated in size<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> and strength that they are unfitted for
    catching wild cattle with the lasso; so that fresh horses have to
    be brought for this purpose from La Plata at a great expense. The
    reduced size of the horses bred on both southern and northern
    islands, and on several mountain-chains, can hardly have been
    caused by the cold, as a similar reduction has occurred on the
    Virginian and Mediterranean islands. The horse can withstand
    intense cold, for wild troops live on the plains of Siberia under
    lat. 56&#176;,<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> and aboriginally
    the horses must have inhabited countries annually covered with
    snow, for he long retains the instinct of scraping it away to get
    at the herbage beneath. The wild tarpans in the East have this
    instinct; and so it is, as I am informed by Admiral Sulivan, with
    the horses recently and formerly introduced into the Falkland
    Islands from La Plata, some of which have run wild; this latter
    fact is remarkable, as the progenitors of these horses could not
    have followed this instinct during many generations in La Plata. On
    the other hand, the wild cattle of the Falklands never scrape away
    the snow, and perish when the ground is long covered. In the
    northern parts of America the horses descended from those
    introduced by the Spanish conquerors of Mexico, have the same
    habit, as have the native bisons, but not so the cattle introduced
    from Europe.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The horse can flourish under intense heat as
    well as under intense cold, for he is known to come to the highest
    perfection, though not attaining a large size, in Arabia and
    northern Africa. Much humidity is apparently more injurious to the
    horse than heat or cold. In the Falkland Islands, horses suffer
    much from the dampness; and this circumstance may perhaps partly
    account for the singular fact that to the eastward of the Bay of
    Bengal,<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> over an enormous and
    humid area, in Ava, Pegu, Siam, the Malayan archipelago, the Loo
    Choo Islands, and a large part of China, no full-sized horse is
    found. When we advance as far eastward as Japan, the horse
    reacquires his full size.<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With most of our domesticated animals, some
    breeds are kept on account of their curiosity or beauty; but the
    horse is valued almost solely for its utility. Hence semi-monstrous
    breeds are not preserved; and probably all the existing breeds have
    been slowly formed either by the direct action of the conditions of
    life, or through the selection of individual differences. No doubt
    semi-monstrous breeds might have been formed: thus Mr. Waterton
    records<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> the case of a mare which
    produced successively three foals without tails; so that a tailless
    race might have been formed like the tailless races of dogs and
    cats. A Russian breed of horses is said to have curled hair, and
    Azara<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> relates that in Paraguay
    horses are occasionally born, but are generally destroyed, with
    hair like that on the head of a negro; and this peculiarity is
    transmitted even to half-breeds: it is a curious case of
    correlation that such horses have short manes and tails, and their
    hoofs are of a peculiar shape like those of a mule.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is scarcely possible to doubt that the
    long-continued selection of qualities serviceable to man has been
    the chief agent in the formation of the several breeds of the
    horse. Look at a dray-horse, and see how well adapted he is to draw
    heavy weights, and how unlike in appearance to any allied wild
    animal. The English race-horse is known to be derived from the
    commingled blood of Arabs, Turks, and Barbs; but selection, which
    was carried on during very early times in England,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> together with training, have made him a
    very different animal from his parent-stocks. As a writer in India,
    who evidently knows the pure Arab well, asks, who now, "looking at
    our present breed of race-horses, could have conceived that they
    were the result of the union of the Arab horse and African mare?"
    The improvement is so marked that in running for the Goodwood Cup
    "the first descendants of Arabian, Turkish, and Persian horses, are
    allowed a discount of 18 pounds weight; and when both parents are
    of these countries a discount of 36 pounds.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> It is notorious that the Arabs have long
    been as careful about the pedigree of their horses as we are, and
    this implies great and continued care in breeding. Seeing what has
    been done in England by careful breeding, can we doubt that the
    Arabs must likewise have produced during the course of centuries a
    marked effect on the qualities of their horses? But we may go much
    farther back in time, for in the Bible we hear of studs carefully
    kept for breeding, and of horses imported at high prices from
    various countries.<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> We may
    therefore conclude that, whether or not the various existing breeds
    of the horse have proceeded from one or more aboriginal stocks, yet
    that a great amount of change has resulted from the direct action
    of the conditions of life, and probably a still greater amount from
    the long-continued selection by man of slight individual
    differences.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With several domesticated quadrupeds and birds,
    certain coloured marks are either strongly inherited or tend to
    reappear after having been lost for a long time. As this subject
    will hereafter be seen to be of importance, I will give a full
    account of the colouring of horses. All English breeds, however
    unlike in size and appearance, and several of those in India and
    the Malay archipelago, present a similar range and diversity of
    colour. The English race-horse, however, is said<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> never to be dun-coloured; but as dun and
    cream-coloured horses are considered by the Arabs as worthless,
    "and fit only for Jews to ride,"<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
    these tints may have been removed by long-continued selection.
    Horses of every colour, and of such widely different kinds as
    dray-horses, cobs, and ponies, are all occasionally dappled,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> in the same manner as is so
    conspicuous with grey horses. This fact does not throw any clear
    light on the colouring of the aboriginal horse, but is a case of
    analogous variation, for even asses are sometimes dappled, and I
    have seen, in the British Museum, a hybrid from the ass and zebra
    dappled on its hinder quarters. By the expression analogous
    variation (and it is one that I shall often have occasion to use) I
    mean a variation occurring in a species or variety which resembles
    a normal character in another and distinct species or variety.
    Analogous variations may arise, as will be explained in a future
    chapter, from two or more forms with a similar constitution having
    been exposed to similar conditions,&#8212;or from one of two forms
    having reacquired through reversion a character inherited by the
    other form from their common progenitor,&#8212;or from both forms
    having reverted to the same ancestral character. We shall
    immediately see that horses occasionally exhibit a tendency to
    become striped over a large part of their bodies; and as we know
    that in the varieties of the domestic cat and in several feline
    species stripes readily pass into spots and cloudy marks&#8212;even
    the cubs of the uniformly-coloured lion being spotted with dark
    marks on a lighter ground&#8212;we may suspect that the dappling of
    the horse, which has been noticed by some authors with surprise, is
    a modification or vestige of a tendency to become striped.</P>

    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This tendency in the horse to become
    striped is in several respects an interesting fact. Horses of all
    colours, of the most diverse breeds, in various parts of the world,
    often have a dark stripe extending along the spine, from the mane
    to the tail; but this is so common that I need enter into no
    particulars.<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> Occasionally horses
    are transversely barred on the legs, chiefly on the under side; and
    more rarely they have a distinct stripe on the shoulder, like that
    on the shoulder of the ass, or a broad dark patch representing a
    stripe. Before entering on any details I must premise that the term
    dun-coloured is vague, and includes three groups of colours, viz.,
    that between cream-colour and reddish-brown, which graduates into
    light-bay or light-chestnut&#8212;this, I believe is often called
    fallow-dun; secondly, leaden or slate-colour or mouse-dun, which
    graduates into an ash-colour; and, lastly, dark-dun, between brown
    and black. In England I have examined a rather large,
    lightly-built, fallow-dun Devonshire pony (Figure 1), with a
    conspicuous stripe along the back, with light transverse stripes on
    the under sides of its front legs, and with four parallel stripes
    on each shoulder. Of these four stripes the posterior one was very
    minute and faint; the anterior one, on the other hand, was long and
    broad, but interrupted in the middle, and truncated at its lower
    extremity, with the anterior angle produced into a long tapering
    point. I mention this latter fact because the shoulder-stripe of
    the ass occasionally presents exactly the same appearance. I have
    had an outline and description sent to me of a small, purely-bred,
    light fallow-dun Welch pony, with a spinal stripe, a single
    transverse stripe on each leg, and three shoulder-stripes; the
    posterior stripe corresponding with that on the shoulder of the ass
    was the longest, whilst the two anterior parallel stripes, arising
    from the mane, decreased in length, in a reversed manner as
    compared with the shoulder-stripes on the above-described
    Devonshire pony. I have seen a bright fallow-dun cob, with its
    front legs transversely barred on the under sides in the most
    conspicuous manner; also a dark-leaden mouse-coloured pony with
    similar leg stripes, but much less conspicuous; also a bright
    fallow-dun colt, fully three-parts thoroughbred, with very plain
    transverse stripes on the legs; also a chestnut-dun cart-horse with
    a conspicuous spinal stripe, with distinct traces of
    shoulder-stripes, but none on the legs; I could add other cases. My
    son made a sketch for me of a large, heavy, Belgian cart-horse, of
    a fallow-dun, with a conspicuous spinal stripe, traces of
    leg-stripes, and with two parallel (three inches apart) stripes
    about seven or eight inches in length on both shoulders. I have
    seen another rather light cart-horse, of a dirty dark cream-colour,
    with striped legs, and on one shoulder a large ill-defined dark
    cloudy patch, and on the opposite shoulder two parallel faint
    stripes. All the cases yet mentioned are duns of various tints; but
    Mr. W. W. Edwards has seen a nearly thoroughbred chestnut horse
    which had the spinal stripe, and distinct bars on the legs; and I
    have seen two bay carriage-horses with black spinal stripes; one of
    these horses had on each shoulder a light shoulder-stripe, and the
    other had a broad back ill-defined stripe, running obliquely
    half-way down each shoulder; neither had leg-stripes.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The most interesting case which I have
    met with occurred in a colt of my own breeding. A bay mare
    (descended from a dark-brown Flemish mare by a light grey Turcoman
    horse) was put to Hercules, a thoroughbred dark bay, whose sire
    (Kingston) and dam were both bays. The colt ultimately turned out
    brown; but when only a fortnight old it was a dirty bay, shaded
    with mouse-grey, and in parts with a yellowish tint: it had only a
    trace of the spinal stripe, with a few obscure transverse bars on
    the legs; but almost the whole body was marked with very narrow
    dark stripes, in most parts so obscure as to be visible only in
    certain lights, like the stripes which may be seen on black
    kittens. These stripes were distinct on the hind-quarters, where
    they diverged from the spine, and pointed a little forwards; many
    of them as they diverged became a little branched, exactly in the
    same manner as in some zebrine species. The stripes were plainest
    on the forehead between the ears, where they formed a set of
    pointed arches, one under the other, decreasing in size downwards
    towards the muzzle; exactly similar marks may be seen on the
    forehead of the quagga and Burchell's zebra. When this foal was two
    or three months old all the stripes entirely disappeared. I have
    seen similar marks on the forehead of a fully grown, fallow-dun,
    cob-like horse, having a conspicuous spinal stripe, and with its
    front legs well barred.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In Norway the colour of the native horse
    or pony is dun, varying from almost cream-colour to dark-mouse dun;
    and an animal is not considered purely bred unless it has the
    spinal and leg-stripes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> My son
    estimated that about a third of the ponies which he saw there had
    striped legs; he counted seven stripes on the fore-legs and two on
    the hind-legs of one pony; only a few of them exhibited traces of
    shoulder stripes; but I have heard of a cob imported from Norway
    which had the shoulder as well as the other stripes well developed.
    Colonel H. Smith<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> alludes to
    dun-horses with the spinal stripe in the Sierras of Spain; and the
    horses originally derived from Spain, in some parts of South
    America, are now duns. Sir W. Elliot informs me that he inspected a
    herd of 300 South American horses imported into Madras, and many of
    these had transverse stripes on the legs and short
    shoulder-stripes; the most strongly marked individual, of which a
    coloured drawing was sent me, was a mouse-dun, with the
    shoulder-stripes slightly forked.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the North-Western parts of India
    striped horses of more than one breed are apparently commoner than
    in any other part of the world; and I have received information
    respecting them from several officers, especially from Colonel
    Poole, Colonel Curtis, Major Campbell, Brigadier St. John, and
    others. The Kattywar horses are often fifteen or sixteen hands in
    height, and are well but lightly built. They are of all colours,
    but the several kinds of duns prevail; and these are so generally
    striped, that a horse without stripes is not considered pure.
    Colonel Poole believes that all the duns have the spinal stripe,
    the leg-stripes are generally present, and he thinks that about
    half the horses have the shoulder-stripe; this stripe is sometimes
    double or treble on both shoulders. Colonel Poole has often seen
    stripes on the cheeks and sides of the nose. He has seen stripes on
    the grey and bay Kattywars when first foaled, but they soon faded
    away. I have received other accounts of cream-coloured, bay, brown,
    and grey Kattywar horses being striped. Eastward of India, the Shan
    (north of Burmah) ponies, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, have
    spinal, leg, and shoulder stripes. Sir W. Elliot informs me that he
    saw two bay Pegu ponies with leg-stripes. Burmese and Javanese
    ponies are frequently dun-coloured, and have the three kinds of
    stripes, "in the same degree as in England."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he examined
    two light-dun ponies of two Chinese breeds, viz., those of Shanghai
    and Amoy; both had the spinal stripe, and the latter an indistinct
    shoulder-stripe.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We thus see that in all parts of the
    world breeds of the horse as different as possible, when of a
    dun-colour (including under this term a wide range of tint from
    cream to dusty black), and rarely when almost white tinged with
    yellow, grey, bay, and chestnut, have the several above-specified
    stripes. Horses which are of a yellow colour with white mane and
    tail, and which are sometimes called duns, I have never seen with
    stripes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From reasons which will be apparent in
    the chapter on Reversion, I have endeavoured, but with poor
    success, to discover whether duns, which are so much oftener
    striped than other coloured horses, are ever produced from the
    crossing of two horses, neither of which are duns. Most persons to
    whom I have applied believe that one parent must be dun; and it is
    generally asserted that, when this is the case, the dun-colour and
    the stripes are strongly inherited.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> One case, however, has fallen under my
    own observation of a foal from a black mare by a bay horse, which
    when fully grown was a dark fallow-dun and had a narrow but plain
    spinal stripe. Hofacker<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> gives two
    instances of mouse-duns (Mausrapp) being produced from two parents
    of different colours and neither duns.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The stripes of all kinds are generally
    plainer in the foal than in the adult horse, being commonly lost at
    the first shedding of the hair.<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
    Colonel Poole believes that "the stripes in the Kattywar breed are
    plainest when the colt is first foaled; they then become less and
    less distinct till after the first coat is shed, when they come out
    as strongly as before; but certainly often fade away as the age of
    the horse increases." Two other accounts confirm this fading of the
    stripes in old horses in India. One writer, on the other hand,
    states that colts are often born without stripes, but that they
    appear as the colt grows older. Three authorities affirm that in
    Norway the stripes are less plain in the foal than in the adult. In
    the case described by me of the young foal which was narrowly
    striped over nearly all its body, there was no doubt about the
    early and complete disappearance of the stripes. Mr. W. W. Edwards
    examined for me twenty-two foals of race-horses, and twelve had the
    spinal stripe more or less plain; this fact, and some other
    accounts which I have received, lead me to believe that the spinal
    stripe often disappears in the English race-horse when old. With
    natural species, the young often exhibit characters which disappear
    at maturity.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The stripes are variable in colour, but are
    always darker than the rest of the body. They do not by any means
    always coexist on the different parts of the body: the legs may be
    striped without any shoulder-stripe, or the converse case, which is
    rarer, may occur; but I have never heard of either shoulder or
    leg-stripes without the spinal stripe. The latter is by far the
    commonest of all the stripes, as might have been expected, as it
    characterises the other seven or eight species of the genus. It is
    remarkable that so trifling a character as the shoulder-stripe
    being double or triple should occur in such different breeds as
    Welch and Devonshire ponies, the Shan pony, heavy cart-horses,
    light South American horses, and the lanky Kattywar breed. Colonel
    Hamilton Smith believes that one of his five supposed primitive
    stocks was dun-coloured and striped; and that the stripes in all
    the other breeds result from ancient crosses with this one
    primitive dun; but it is extremely improbable that different breeds
    living in such distant quarters of the world should all have been
    crossed with any one aboriginally distinct stock. Nor have we any
    reason to believe that the effects of a cross at a very remote
    period would be propagated for so many generations as is implied on
    this view.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the primitive colour of the
    horse having been dun, Colonel Hamilton Smith<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> has collected a large body of evidence
    showing that this tint was common in the East as far back as the
    time of Alexander, and that the wild horses of Western Asia and
    Eastern Europe now are, or recently were, of various shades of dun.
    It seems that not very long ago a wild breed of dun-coloured horses
    with a spinal stripe was preserved in the royal parks in Prussia. I
    hear from Hungary that the inhabitants of that country look at the
    duns with a spinal stripe as the aboriginal stock, and so it is in
    Norway. Dun-coloured ponies are not rare in the mountainous parts
    of Devonshire, Wales, and Scotland, where the aboriginal breed
    would have the best chance of being preserved. In South America in
    the time of Azara, when the horse had been feral for about 250
    years, 90 out of 100 horses were "bai-ch&#226;tains," and the
    remaining ten were "zains," that is brown; not more than one in
    2000 being black. In North America the feral horses show a strong
    tendency to become roans of various shades; but in certain parts,
    as I hear from Dr. Canfield, they are mostly duns and striped.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the following chapters on the Pigeon we shall
    see that a blue bird is occasionally produced by pure breeds of
    various colours and that when this occurs certain black marks
    invariably appear on the wings and tail; so again, when variously
    coloured breeds are crossed, blue birds with the same black marks
    are frequently produced. We shall further see that these facts are
    explained by, and afford strong evidence in favour of, the view
    that all the breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon, or <I>
    Columba livia,</I> which is thus coloured and marked. But the
    appearance of the stripes on the various breeds of the horse, when
    of a dun colour, does not afford nearly such good evidence of their
    descent from a single primitive stock as in the case of the pigeon:
    because no horse certainly wild is known as a standard of
    comparison; because the stripes when they appear are variable in
    character; because there is far from sufficient evidence that the
    crossing of distinct breeds produces stripes, and lastly, because
    all the species of the genus Equus have the spinal stripe, and
    several species have shoulder and leg stripes. Nevertheless the
    similarity in the most distinct breeds in their general range of
    colour, in their dappling, and in the occasional appearance,
    especially in duns, of leg-stripes and of double or triple
    shoulder-stripes, taken together, indicate the probability of the
    descent of all the existing races from a single, dun-coloured, more
    or less striped, primitive stock, to which our horses occasionally
    revert.</P>

      <H3>THE ASS.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Four species of Asses, besides three zebras,
    have been described by naturalists. There is now little doubt that
    our domesticated animal is descended from the <I>Equus
    t&#230;niopus</I> of Abyssinia.<A href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
    The ass is sometimes advanced as an instance of an animal
    domesticated, as we know by the Old Testament, from an ancient
    period, which has varied only in a very slight degree. But this is
    by no means strictly true; for in Syria alone there are four
    breeds;<A href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> first, a light and
    graceful animal, with an agreeable gait, used by ladies; secondly,
    an Arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle; thirdly, a
    stouter animal used for ploughing and various purposes; and lastly,
    the large Damascus breed, with a peculiarly long body and ears. In
    the South of France also there are several breeds, and one of
    extraordinary size, some individuals being as tall as full-sized
    horses. Although the ass in England is by no means uniform in
    appearance, distinct breeds have not been formed. This may probably
    be accounted for by the animal being kept chiefly by poor persons,
    who do not rear large numbers, nor carefully match and select the
    young. For, as we shall see in a future chapter, the ass can with
    ease be greatly improved in size and strength by careful selection,
    combined no doubt with good food; and we may infer that all its
    other characters would be equally amenable to selection. The small
    size of the ass in England and Northern Europe is apparently due
    far more to want of care in breeding than to cold; for in Western
    India, where the ass is used as a beast of burden by some of the
    lower castes, it is not much larger than a Newfoundland dog, "being
    generally not more than from twenty to thirty inches high."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The ass varies greatly in colour; and its legs,
    especially the fore-legs, both in England and other
    countries&#8212;for instance, in China&#8212;are occasionally
    barred more plainly than those of dun-coloured horses. Thirteen or
    fourteen transverse stripes have been counted on both the fore and
    hind legs. With the horse the occasional appearance of leg-stripes
    was accounted for by reversion to a supposed parent-form, and in
    the case of the ass we may confidently believe in this explanation,
    as <I>E. t&#230;niopus</I> is known to be barred, though only in a
    slight degree, and not quite invariably. The stripes are believed
    to occur most frequently and to be plainest on the legs of the
    domestic ass during early youth,<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
    as likewise occurs with the horse. The shoulder-stripe, which is so
    eminently characteristic of the species, is nevertheless variable
    in breadth, length, and manner of termination. I have measured one
    four times as broad as another, and some more than twice as long as
    others. In one light-grey ass the shoulder-stripe was only six
    inches in length, and as thin as a piece of string; and in another
    animal of the same colour there was only a dusky shade representing
    a stripe. I have heard of three white asses, not albinoes, with no
    trace of shoulder or spinal stripes;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> and I have seen nine other asses with no
    shoulder-stripe, and some of them had no spinal stripe. Three of
    the nine were light-greys, one a dark-grey, another grey passing
    into reddish-roan, and the others were brown, two being tinted on
    parts of their bodies with a reddish or bay shade. If therefore
    grey and reddish-brown asses had been steadily selected and bred
    from, the shoulder stripe would probably have been lost almost as
    generally and completely as in the case of the horse.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The shoulder stripe on the ass is sometimes
    double, and Mr. Blyth has seen even three or four parallel
    stripes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> I have observed in ten
    cases shoulder-stripes abruptly truncated at the lower end, with
    the anterior angle produced into a tapering point, precisely as in
    the above dun Devonshire pony. I have seen three cases of the
    terminal portion abruptly and angularly bent; and have seen and
    heard of four cases of a distinct though slight forking of the
    stripe. In Syria, Dr. Hooker and his party observed for me no less
    than five similar instances of the shoulder-stripe plainly
    bifurcating over the fore leg. In the common mule it likewise
    sometimes bifurcates. When I first noticed the forking and angular
    bending of the shoulder-stripe, I had seen enough of the stripes in
    the various equine species to feel convinced that even a character
    so unimportant as this had a distinct meaning, and was thus led to
    attend to the subject. I now find that in the <I>E. burchellii</I>
    and <I>quagga,</I> the stripe which corresponds with the
    shoulder-stripe of the ass, as well as some of the stripes on the
    neck, bifurcate, and that some of those near the shoulder have
    their extremities bent angularly backwards. The bifurcation and
    angular bending of the stripes on the shoulders apparently are
    connected with the nearly upright stripes on the sides of the body
    and neck changing their direction and becoming transverse on the
    legs. Finally, we see that the presence of shoulder, leg, and
    spinal stripes in the horse,&#8212; their occasional absence in the
    ass,&#8212;the occurrence of double and triple shoulder-stripes in
    both animals, and the similar manner in which these stripes
    terminate downwards,&#8212;are all cases of analogous variation in
    the horse and ass. These cases are probably not due to similar
    conditions acting on similar constitutions, but to a partial
    reversion in colour to the common progenitor of the genus. We shall
    hereafter return to this subject, and discuss it more fully.</P>
