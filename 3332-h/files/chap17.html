    <P align="JUSTIFY">The gain in constitutional vigour, derived from
    an occasional cross between individuals of the same variety, but
    belonging to distinct families, or between distinct varieties, has
    not been so largely or so frequently discussed, as have the evil
    effects of too close interbreeding. But the former point is the
    more important of the two, inasmuch as the evidence is more
    decisive. The evil results from close interbreeding are difficult
    to detect, for they accumulate slowly, and differ much in degree
    with different species; whilst the good effects which almost
    invariably follow a cross are from the first manifest. It should,
    however, be clearly understood that the advantage of close
    interbreeding, as far as the retention of character is concerned,
    is indisputable, and often outweighs the evil of a slight loss of
    constitutional vigour. In relation to the subject of domestication,
    the whole question is of some importance, as too close
    interbreeding interferes with the improvement of old races. It is
    important as indirectly bearing on Hybridism; and possibly on the
    extinction of species, when any form has become so rare that only a
    few individuals remain within a confined area. It bears in an
    important manner on the influence of free intercrossing, in
    obliterating individual differences, and thus giving uniformity of
    character to the individuals of the same race or species; for if
    additional vigour and fertility be thus gained, the crossed
    offspring will multiply and prevail, and the ultimate result will
    be far greater than otherwise would have occurred. Lastly, the
    question is of high interest, as bearing on mankind. I shall
    therefore discuss this subject at full length. As the facts which
    prove the evil effects of close interbreeding are more copious,
    though less decisive, than those on the good effects of crossing, I
    shall, under each group of beings, begin with the former.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is no difficulty in defining what is meant
    by a cross; but this is by no means easy in regard to "breeding in
    and in" or "too close interbreeding," because, as we shall see,
    different species of animals are differently affected by the same
    degree of interbreeding. The pairing of a father and daughter, or
    mother and son, or brothers and sisters, if carried on during
    several generations, is the closest possible form of interbreeding.
    But some good judges, for instance Sir J. Sebright, believe that
    the pairing of a brother and sister is much closer than that of
    parents and children; for when the father is matched with his
    daughter he crosses, as is said, with only half his own blood. The
    consequences of close interbreeding carried on for too long a time,
    are, as is generally believed, loss of size, constitutional vigour,
    and fertility, sometimes accompanied by a tendency to malformation.
    Manifest evil does not usually follow from pairing the nearest
    relations for two, three, or even four generations; but several
    causes interfere with our detecting the evil&#8212;such as the
    deterioration being very gradual, and the difficulty of
    distinguishing between such direct evil and the inevitable
    augmentation of any morbid tendencies which may be latent or
    apparent in the related parents. On the other hand, the benefit
    from a cross, even when there has not been any very close
    interbreeding, is almost invariably at once conspicuous. There is
    good reason to believe, and this was the opinion of that most
    experienced observer Sir J. Sebright,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> that the evil effects of close
    interbreeding may be checked or quite prevented by the related
    individuals being separated for a few generations and exposed to
    different conditions of life. This conclusion is now held by many
    breeders; for instance Mr. Carr<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
    remarks, it is a well-known "fact that a change of soil and climate
    effects perhaps almost as great a change in the constitution as
    would result from an infusion of fresh blood." I hope to show in a
    future work that consanguinity by itself counts for nothing, but
    acts solely from related organisms generally having a similar
    constitution, and having been exposed in most cases to similar
    conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That any evil directly follows from the closest
    interbreeding has been denied by many persons; but rarely by any
    practical breeder; and never, as far as I know, by one who has
    largely bred animals which propagate their kind quickly. Many
    physiologists attribute the evil exclusively to the combination and
    consequent increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents;
    and that this is an active source of mischief there can be no
    doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that men and various
    domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution, and with a
    strong hereditary disposition to disease, if not actually ill, are
    fully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on
    the other hand, often induces sterility; and this indicates
    something quite distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies
    common to both parents. The evidence immediately to be given
    convinces me that it is a great law of nature, that all organic
    beings profit from an occasional cross with individuals not closely
    related to them in blood; and that, on the other hand,
    long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Various general considerations have had much
    influence in leading me to this conclusion; but the reader will
    probably rely more on special facts and opinions. The authority of
    experienced observers, even when they do not advance the grounds of
    their belief, is of some little value. Now almost all men who have
    bred many kinds of animals and have written on the subject, such as
    Sir J. Sebright, Andrew Knight, etc.,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> have expressed the strongest conviction
    on the impossibility of long-continued close interbreeding. Those
    who have compiled works on agriculture, and have associated much
    with breeders, such as the sagacious Youatt, Low, etc., have
    strongly declared their opinion to the same effect. Prosper Lucas,
    trusting largely to French authorities, has come to a similar
    conclusion. The distinguished German agriculturist Hermann von
    Nathusius, who has written the most able treatise on this subject
    which I have met with, concurs; and as I shall have to quote from
    this treatise, I may state that Nathusius is not only intimately
    acquainted with works on agriculture in all languages, and knows
    the pedigrees of our British breeds better than most Englishmen,
    but has imported many of our improved animals, and is himself an
    experienced breeder.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Evidence of the evil effects of close
    interbreeding can most readily be acquired in the case of animals,
    such as fowls, pigeons, etc., which propagate quickly, and, from
    being kept in the same place, are exposed to the same conditions.
    Now I have inquired of very many breeders of these birds, and I
    have hitherto not met with a single man who was not thoroughly
    convinced that an occasional cross with another strain of the same
    sub-variety was absolutely necessary. Most breeders of highly
    improved or fancy birds value their own strain, and are most
    unwilling, at the risk, in their opinion, of deterioration, to make
    a cross. The purchase of a first-rate bird of another strain is
    expensive, and exchanges are troublesome; yet all breeders, as far
    as I can hear, excepting those who keep large stocks at different
    places for the sake of crossing, are driven after a time to take
    this step.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Another general consideration which has had
    great influence on my mind is, that with all hermaphrodite animals
    and plants, which it might have been thought would have perpetually
    fertilised themselves and been thus subjected for long ages to the
    closest interbreeding, there is not a single species, as far as I
    can discover, in which the structure ensures self-fertilisation. On
    the contrary, there are in a multitude of cases, as briefly stated
    in the fifteenth chapter, manifest adaptations which favour or
    inevitably lead to an occasional cross between one hermaphrodite
    and another of the same species; and these adaptive structures are
    utterly purposeless, as far as we can see, for any other end.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With <I>Cattle</I> there can be no doubt
    that extremely close interbreeding may be long carried on
    advantageously with respect to external characters, and with no
    manifest evil as far as constitution is concerned. The case of
    Bakewell's Longhorns, which were closely interbred for a long
    period, has often been quoted; yet Youatt says<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> the breed "had acquired a delicacy of
    constitution inconsistent with common management," and "the
    propagation of the species was not always certain." But the
    Shorthorns offer the most striking case of close interbreeding; for
    instance, the famous bull Favourite (who was himself the offspring
    of a half-brother and sister from Foljambe) was matched with his
    own daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter; so that the
    produce of this last union, or the great-great-granddaughter, had
    15-16ths, or 93&#183;75 per cent of the blood of Favourite in her
    veins. This cow was matched with the bull Wellington, having
    62&#183;5 per cent of Favourite blood in his veins, and produced
    Clarissa; Clarissa was matched with the bull Lancaster, having
    68&#183;75 of the same blood, and she yielded valuable offspring.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> Nevertheless Collings, who reared
    these animals, and was a strong advocate for close breeding, once
    crossed his stock with a Galloway, and the cows from this cross
    realised the highest prices. Bates's herd was esteemed the most
    celebrated in the world. For thirteen years he bred most closely in
    and in; but during the next seventeen years, though he had the most
    exalted notion of the value of his own stock, he thrice infused
    fresh blood into his herd: it is said that he did this, not to
    improve the form of his animals, but on account of their lessened
    fertility. Mr. Bates's own view, as given by a celebrated
    breeder,<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> was, that "to breed
    in-and-in from a bad stock was ruin and devastation; yet that the
    practice may be safely followed within certain limits when the
    parents so related are descended from first-rate animals." We thus
    see that there has been much close interbreeding with Shorthorns;
    but Nathusius, after the most careful study of their pedigrees,
    says that he can find no instance of a breeder who has strictly
    followed this practice during his whole life. From this study and
    his own experience, he concludes that close interbreeding is
    necessary to ennoble the stock; but that in effecting this the
    greatest care is necessary, on account of the tendency to
    infertility and weakness. It may be added, that another high
    authority<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> asserts that many more
    calves are born cripples from Shorthorns than from other and less
    closely interbred races of cattle.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although by carefully selecting the best
    animals (as Nature effectually does by the law of battle) close
    interbreeding may be long carried on with cattle, yet the good
    effects of a cross between almost any two breeds is at once shown
    by the greater size and vigour of the offspring; as Mr. Spooner
    writes to me, "crossing distinct breeds certainly improves cattle
    for the butcher." Such crossed animals are of course of no value to
    the breeder; but they have been raised during many years in several
    parts of England to be slaughtered;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> and their merit is now so fully
    recognised, that at fat-cattle shows a separate class has been
    formed for their reception. The best fat ox at the great show at
    Islington in 1862 was a crossed animal.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The half-wild cattle, which have been
    kept in British parks probably for 400 or 500 years, or even for a
    longer period, have been advanced by Culley and others as a case of
    long-continued interbreeding within the limits of the same herd
    without any consequent injury. With respect to the cattle at
    Chillingham, the late Lord Tankerville owned that they were bad
    breeders.<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> The agent, Mr. Hardy,
    estimates (in a letter to me, dated May, 1861) that in the herd of
    about fifty the average number annually slaughtered, killed by
    fighting, and dying, is about ten, or one in five. As the herd is
    kept up to nearly the same average number, the annual rate of
    increase must be likewise about one in five. The bulls, I may add,
    engage in furious battles, of which battles the present Lord
    Tankerville has given me a graphic description, so that there will
    always be rigorous selection of the most vigorous males. I procured
    in 1855 from Mr. D. Gardner, agent to the Duke of Hamilton, the
    following account of the wild cattle kept in the Duke's park in
    Lanarkshire, which is about 200 acres in extent. The number of
    cattle varies from sixty-five to eighty; and the number annually
    killed (I presume by all causes) is from eight to ten; so that the
    annual rate of increase can hardly be more than one in six. Now in
    South America, where the herds are half-wild, and therefore offer a
    nearly fair standard of comparison, according to Azara the natural
    increase of the cattle on an estancia is from one-third to
    one-fourth of the total number, or one in between three and four
    and this, no doubt, applies exclusively to adult animals fit for
    consumption. Hence the half-wild British cattle which have long
    interbred within the limits of the same herd are relatively far
    less fertile. Although in an unenclosed country like Paraguay there
    must be some crossing between the different herds, yet even there
    the inhabitants believe that the occasional introduction of animals
    from distant localities is necessary to prevent "degeneration in
    size and diminution of fertility."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> The decrease in size from ancient times
    in the Chillingham and Hamilton cattle must have been prodigious,
    for Professor R&#252;timeyer has shown that they are almost
    certainly the descendants of the gigantic <I>Bos primigenius.</I>
    No doubt this decrease in size may be largely attributed to less
    favourable conditions of life; yet animals roaming over large
    parks, and fed during severe winters, can hardly be considered as
    placed under very unfavourable conditions.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With <I>Sheep</I> there has often been
    long-continued interbreeding within the limits of the same flock;
    but whether the nearest relations have been matched so frequently
    as in the case of Shorthorn cattle, I do not know. The Messrs.
    Brown during fifty years have never infused fresh blood into their
    excellent flock of Leicesters. Since 1810 Mr. Barford has acted on
    the same principle with the Foscote flock. He asserts that half a
    century of experience has convinced him that when two nearly
    related animals are quite sound in constitution, in-and-in breeding
    does not induce degeneracy; but he adds that he "does not pride
    himself on breeding from the nearest affinities." In France the Naz
    flock has been bred for sixty years without the introduction of a
    single strange ram.<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Nevertheless,
    most great breeders of sheep have protested against close
    interbreeding prolonged for too great a length of time.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> The most celebrated of recent breeders,
    Jonas Webb, kept five separate families to work on, thus "retaining
    the requisite distance of relationship between the sexes";<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> and what is probably of greater
    importance, the separate flocks will have been exposed to somewhat
    different conditions.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although by the aid of careful selection
    the near interbreeding of sheep may be long continued without any
    manifest evil, yet it has often been the practice with farmers to
    cross distinct breeds to obtain animals for the butcher, which
    plainly shows that good of some kind is derived from this practice.
    We have excellent evidence on this head from Mr. S. Druce,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> who gives in detail the comparative
    numbers of four pure breeds and of a cross-breed which can be
    supported on the same ground, and he gives their produce in fleece
    and carcase. A high authority, Mr. Pusey, sums up the result in
    money value during an equal length of time, namely (neglecting
    shillings), for Cotswolds 248<I>l</I>., for Leicesters
    223<I>l</I>., for Southdowns 204<I>l</I>., for Hampshire Downs
    264<I>l</I>., and for the crossbred 293<I>l</I>. A former
    celebrated breeder, Lord Somerville, states that his half-breeds
    from Ryelands and Spanish sheep were larger animals than either the
    pure Ryelands or pure Spanish sheep. Mr. Spooner concludes his
    excellent Essay on Crossing by asserting that there is a pecuniary
    advantage in judicious cross-breeding, especially when the male is
    larger than the female.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As some of our British parks are ancient,
    it occurred to me that there must have been long-continued close
    interbreeding with the fallow-deer (<I>Cervus dama</I>) kept in
    them; but on inquiry I find that it is a common practice to infuse
    new blood by procuring bucks from other parks. Mr. Shirley,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> who has carefully studied the management
    of deer, admits that in some parks there has been no admixture of
    foreign blood from a time beyond the memory of man. But he
    concludes "that in the end the constant breeding in-and-in is sure
    to tell to the disadvantage of the whole herd, though it may take a
    very long time to prove it; moreover, when we find, as is very
    constantly the case, that the introduction of fresh blood has been
    of the very greatest use to deer, both by improving their size and
    appearance, and particularly by being of service in removing the
    taint of 'rickback,' if not of other diseases, to which deer are
    sometimes subject when the blood has not been changed, there can, I
    think, be no doubt but that a judicious cross with a good stock is
    of the greatest consequence, and is indeed essential, sooner or
    later, to the prosperity of every well-ordered park."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Meynell's famous foxhounds have been
    adduced, as showing that no ill effects follow from close
    interbreeding; and Sir J. Sebright ascertained from him that he
    frequently bred from father and daughter, mother and son, and
    sometimes even from brothers and sisters. With greyhounds also
    there has been much close interbreeding, but the best breeders
    agree that it may be carried too far.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> But Sir J. Sebright declares,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> that by breeding in-and-in, by which he
    means matching brothers and sisters, he has actually seen the
    offspring of strong spaniels degenerate into weak and diminutive
    lapdogs. The Rev. W. D. Fox has communicated to me the case of a
    small lot of bloodhounds, long kept in the same family, which had
    become very bad breeders, and nearly all had a bony enlargement in
    the tail. A single cross with a distinct strain of bloodhounds
    restored their fertility, and drove away the tendency to
    malformation in the tail. I have heard the particulars of another
    case with bloodhounds, in which the female had to be held to the
    male. Considering how rapid is the natural increase of the dog, it
    is difficult to understand the large price of all highly improved
    breeds, which almost implies long-continued close interbreeding,
    except on the belief that this process lessens fertility and
    increases liability to distemper and other diseases. A high
    authority, Mr. Scrope, attributes the rarity and deterioration in
    size of the Scotch deerhound (the few individuals formerly existing
    throughout the country being all related) in large part to close
    interbreeding.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With all highly-bred animals there is
    more or less difficulty in getting them to procreate quickly, and
    all suffer much from delicacy of constitution. A great judge of
    rabbits<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> says, "the long-eared
    does are often too highly bred or forced in their youth to be of
    much value as breeders, often turning out barren or bad mothers."
    They often desert their young, so that it is necessary to have
    nurse-rabbits, but I do not pretend to attribute all these evil
    results to close interbreeding.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to <I>Pigs</I> there is more
    unanimity amongst breeders on the evil effects of close
    interbreeding than, perhaps, with any other large animal. Mr.
    Druce, a great and successful breeder of the Improved Oxfordshires
    (a crossed race), writes, "without a change of boars of a different
    tribe, but of the same breed, constitution cannot be preserved."
    Mr. Fisher Hobbs, the raiser of the celebrated Improved Essex
    breed, divided his stock into three separate families, by which
    means he maintained the breed for more than twenty years, "by
    judicious selection from the <I>three distinct families.</I>"<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> Lord Western was the first importer
    of a Neapolitan boar and sow. "From this pair he bred in-and-in,
    until the breed was in danger of becoming extinct, a sure result
    (as Mr. Sidney remarks) of in-and-in breeding." Lord Western then
    crossed his Neapolitan pigs with the old Essex, and made the first
    great step towards the Improved Essex breed. Here is a more
    interesting case. Mr. J. Wright, well known as a breeder, crossed<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> the same boar with the daughter,
    granddaughter, and great-granddaughter, and so on for seven
    generations. The result was, that in many instances the offspring
    failed to breed; in others they produced few that lived; and of the
    latter many were idiotic, without sense, even to suck, and when
    attempting to move could not walk straight. Now it deserves
    especial notice, that the two last sows produced by this long
    course of interbreeding were sent to other boars, and they bore
    several litters of healthy pigs. The best sow in external
    appearance produced during the whole seven generations was one in
    the last stage of descent; but the litter consisted of this one
    sow. She would not breed to her sire, yet bred at the first trial
    to a stranger in blood. So that, in Mr. Wright's case,
    long-continued and extremely close interbreeding did not affect the
    external form or merit of the young; but with many of them the
    general constitution and mental powers, and especially the
    reproductive functions, were seriously affected.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Nathusius gives<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> an analogous and even more striking
    case: he imported from England a pregnant sow of the large
    Yorkshire breed, and bred the product closely in-and-in for three
    generations: the result was unfavourable, as the young were weak in
    constitution, with impaired fertility. One of the latest sows,
    which he esteemed a good animal, produced, when paired with her own
    uncle (who was known to be productive with sows of other breeds), a
    litter of six, and a second time a litter of only five weak young
    pigs. He then paired this sow with a boar of a small black breed,
    which he had likewise imported from England; this boar, when
    matched with sows of his own breed, produced from seven to nine
    young. Now, the sow of the large breed, which was so unproductive
    when paired with her own uncle, yielded to the small black boar, in
    the first litter twenty-one, and in the second litter eighteen
    young pigs; so that in one year she produced thirty-nine fine young
    animals!</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As in the case of several other animals
    already mentioned, even when no injury is perceptible from
    moderately close interbreeding, yet, to quote the words of Mr.
    Coate (who five times won the annual gold medal of the Smithfield
    Club Show for the best pen of pigs), "Crosses answer well for
    profit to the farmer, as you get more constitution and quicker
    growth; but for me, who sell a great number of pigs for breeding
    purposes, I find it will not do, as it requires many years to get
    anything like purity of blood again."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Almost all the animals as yet mentioned are
    gregarious, and the males must frequently pair with their own
    daughters, for they expel the young males as well as all intruders,
    until forced by old age and loss of strength to yield to some
    stronger male. It is therefore not improbable that gregarious
    animals may have been rendered less susceptible than non-social
    species to the evil consequences of close interbreeding, so that
    they may be enabled to live in herds without injury to their
    offspring. Unfortunately we do not know whether an animal like the
    cat, which is not gregarious, would suffer from close interbreeding
    in a greater degree than our other domesticated animals. But the
    pig is not, as far as I can discover, strictly gregarious, and we
    have seen that it appears eminently liable to the evil effects of
    close interbreeding. Mr. Huth, in the case of the pig, attributes
    (Chapter XXIV) these effects to their having been "cultivated most
    for their fat," or to the selected individuals having had a weak
    constitution; but we must remember that it is great breeders who
    have brought forward the above cases, and who are far more familiar
    than ordinary men can be, with the causes which are likely to
    interfere with the fertility of their animals.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The effects of close interbreeding in the case
    of man is a difficult subject, on which I will say but little. It
    has been discussed by various authors under many points of view.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> Mr. Tylor<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> has shown that with widely different
    races in the most distant quarters of the world, marriages between
    relations&#8212;even between distant relations&#8212;have been
    strictly prohibited. There are, however, many exceptions to the
    rule, which are fully given by Mr. Huth.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> It is a curious problem how these
    prohibitions arose during early and barbarous times. Mr. Tylor is
    inclined to attribute them to the evil effects of consanguineous
    marriages having been observed; and he ingeniously attempts to
    explain some apparent anomalies in the prohibition not extending
    equally to the relations on the male and female side. He admits,
    however, that other causes, such as the extension of friendly
    alliances, may have come into play. Mr. W. Adam, on the other hand,
    concludes that related marriages are prohibited and viewed with
    repugnance, from the confusion which would thus arise in the
    descent of property, and from other still more recondite reasons.
    But I cannot accept these views, seeing that incest is held in
    abhorrence by savages such as those of Australia and South
    America,<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> who have no property to
    bequeath, or fine moral feelings to confuse, and who are not likely
    to reflect on distant evils to their progeny. According to Mr. Huth
    the feeling is the indirect result of exogamy, inasmuch as when
    this practice ceased in any tribe and it became endogamous, so that
    marriages were strictly confined to the same tribe, it is not
    unlikely that a vestige of the former practice would still be
    retained, so that closely-related marriages would be prohibited.
    With respect to exogamy itself Mr. MacLennan believes that it arose
    from a scarcity of women, owing to female infanticide, aided
    perhaps by other causes.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has been clearly shown by Mr. Huth that there
    is no instinctive feeling in man against incest any more than in
    gregarious animals. We know also how readily any prejudice or
    feeling may rise to abhorrence, as shown by Hindus in regard to
    objects causing defilement. Although there seems to be no strong
    inherited feeling in mankind against incest, it seems possible that
    men during primeval times may have been more excited by strange
    females than by those with whom they habitually lived; in the same
    manner as according to Mr. Cupples,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> male deerhounds are inclined towards
    strange females, while the females prefer dogs with whom they have
    associated. If any such feeling formerly existed in man, this would
    have led to a preference for marriages beyond the nearest kin, and
    might have been strengthened by the offspring of such marriages
    surviving in greater numbers, as analogy would lead us to believe
    would have occurred.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whether consanguineous marriages, such as are
    permitted in civilised nations, and which would not be considered
    as close interbreeding in the case of our domesticated animals,
    cause any injury will never be known with certainty until a census
    is taken with this object in view. My son, George Darwin, has done
    what is possible at present by a statistical investigation,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> and he has come to the conclusion, from
    his own researches and those of Dr. Mitchell, that the evidence as
    to any evil thus caused is conflicting, but on the whole points to
    the evil being very small.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Birds.</I>&#8212;In the case of the
    <I>Fowl</I> a whole array of authorities could be given against too
    close interbreeding. Sir J. Sebright positively asserts that he
    made many trials, and that his fowls, when thus treated, became
    long in the legs, small in the body, and bad breeders.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> He produced the famous Sebright Bantams
    by complicated crosses, and by breeding in-and-in; and since his
    time there has been much close interbreeding with these animals;
    and they are now notoriously bad breeders. I have seen Silver
    Bantams, directly descended from his stock, which had become almost
    as barren as hybrids; for not a single chicken had been that year
    hatched from two full nests of eggs. Mr. Hewitt says that with
    these Bantams the sterility of the male stands, with rare
    exceptions, in the closest relation with their loss of certain
    secondary male characters: he adds, "I have noticed, as a general
    rule, that even the slightest deviation from feminine character in
    the tail of the male Sebright&#8212;say the elongation by only half
    an inch of the two principal tail feathers&#8212;brings with it
    improved probability of increased fertility."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Wright states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> that Mr. Clark, "whose fighting-cocks
    were so notorious, continued to breed from his own kind till they
    lost their disposition to fight, but stood to be cut up without
    making any resistance, and were so reduced in size as to be under
    those weights required for the best prizes; but on obtaining a
    cross from Mr. Leighton, they again resumed their former courage
    and weight." It should be borne in mind that game-cocks before they
    fought were always weighed, so that nothing was left to the
    imagination about any reduction or increase of weight. Mr. Clark
    does not seem to have bred from brothers and sisters, which is the
    most injurious kind of union; and he found, after repeated trials,
    that there was a greater reduction in weight in the young from a
    father paired with his daughter, than from a mother with her son. I
    may add that Mr. Eyton of Eyton, the well-known ornithologist, who
    is a large breeder of Grey Dorkings, informs me that they certainly
    diminish in size, and become less prolific, unless a cross with
    another strain is occasionally obtained. So it is with Malays,
    according to Mr. Hewitt, as far as size is concerned.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>An experienced writer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> remarks that the same amateur, as is
    well known, seldom long maintains the superiority of his birds; and
    this, he adds, undoubtedly is due to all his stock "being of the
    same blood;" hence it is indispensable that he should occasionally
    procure a bird of another strain. But this is not necessary with
    those who keep a stock of fowls at different stations. Thus, Mr.
    Ballance, who has bred Malays for thirty years, and has won more
    prizes with these birds than any other fancier in England, says
    that breeding in-and-in does not necessarily cause deterioration;
    "but all depends upon how this is managed. My plan has been to keep
    about five or six distinct runs, and to rear about two hundred or
    three hundred chickens each year, and select the best birds from
    each run for crossing. I thus secure sufficient crossing to prevent
    deterioration."<A href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We thus see that there is almost complete
    unanimity with poultry-breeders that, when fowls are kept at the
    same place, evil quickly follows from interbreeding carried on to
    an extent which would be disregarded in the case of most
    quadrupeds. Moreover, it is a generally received opinion that
    cross-bred chickens are the hardiest and most easily reared.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> Mr. Tegetmeier, who has carefully
    attended to poultry of all breeds, says<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> that Dorking hens, allowed to run with
    Houdan or Crevec&#339;ur cocks, "produce in the early spring
    chickens that for size, hardihood, early maturity, and fitness for
    the market, surpass those of any pure breed that we have ever
    raised." Mr. Hewitt gives it as a general rule with fowls, that
    crossing the breed increases their size. He makes this remark after
    stating that hybrids from the pheasant and fowl are considerably
    larger than either progenitor: so again, hybrids from the male
    golden pheasant and female common pheasant "are of far larger size
    than either parent-bird."<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> To this
    subject of the increased size of hybrids I shall presently
    return.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With <I>Pigeons,</I> breeders are
    unanimous, as previously stated, that it is absolutely
    indispensable, notwithstanding the trouble and expense thus caused,
    occasionally to cross their much-prized birds with individuals of
    another strain, but belonging, of course, to the same variety. It
    deserves notice that, when size is one of the desired characters,
    as with pouters<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> the evil effects
    of close interbreeding are much sooner perceived than when small
    birds, such as short-faced tumblers, are valued. The extreme
    delicacy of the high fancy breeds, such as these tumblers and
    improved English carriers, is remarkable; they are liable to many
    diseases, and often die in the egg or during the first moult; and
    their eggs have generally to be hatched under foster-mothers.
    Although these highly-prized birds have invariably been subjected
    to much close interbreeding, yet their extreme delicacy of
    constitution cannot perhaps be thus fully explained. Mr. Yarrell
    informed me that Sir J. Sebright continued closely interbreeding
    some owl-pigeons, until from their extreme sterility he as nearly
    as possible lost the whole family. Mr. Brent<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> tried to raise a breed of trumpeters, by
    crossing a common pigeon, and recrossing the daughter,
    granddaughter, great-granddaughter, and great-great-granddaughter,
    with the same male trumpeter, until he obtained a bird with 15/16
    of trumpeter's blood; but then the experiment failed, for "breeding
    so close stopped reproduction." The experienced Neumeister<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> also asserts that the offspring from
    dovecotes and various other breeds are "generally very fertile and
    hardy birds:" so again MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233;,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> after forty-five years' experience,
    recommend persons to cross their breeds for amusement; for, if they
    fail to make interesting birds, they will succeed under an
    economical point of view, "as it is found that mongrels are more
    fertile than pigeons of pure race."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will refer only to one other animal,
    namely, the Hive-bee, because a distinguished entomologist has
    advanced this as a case of inevitable close interbreeding. As the
    hive is tenanted by a single female, it might have been thought
    that her male and female offspring would always have bred together,
    more especially as bees of different hives are hostile to each
    other; a strange worker being almost always attacked when trying to
    enter another hive. But Mr. Tegetmeier has shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> that this instinct does not apply to
    drones, which are permitted to enter any hive; so that there is no
    <I>&#224; priori</I> improbability of a queen receiving a foreign
    drone. The fact of the union invariably and necessarily taking
    place on the wing, during the queen's nuptial flight, seems to be a
    special provision against continued interbreeding. However this may
    be, experience has shown, since the introduction of the
    yellow-banded Ligurian race into Germany and England, that bees
    freely cross: Mr. Woodbury, who introduced Ligurian bees into
    Devonshire, found during a single season that three stocks, at
    distances of from one to two miles from his hives, were crossed by
    his drones. In one case the Ligurian drones must have flown over
    the city of Exeter, and over several intermediate hives. On another
    occasion several common black queens were crossed by Ligurian
    drones at a distance of from one to three and a half miles.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>When a single plant of a new species is
    introduced into any country, if propagated by seed, many
    individuals will soon be raised, so that if the proper insects be
    present there will be crossing. With newly-introduced trees or
    other plants not propagated by seed we are not here concerned. With
    old-established plants it is an almost universal practice
    occasionally to make exchanges of seed, by which means individuals
    which have been exposed to different conditions of life,&#8212;and
    this, as we have seen with animals, diminishes the evil from close
    interbreeding,&#8212;will occasionally be introduced into each
    district.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to individuals belonging to
    the same sub-variety, G&#228;rtner, whose accuracy and experience
    exceeded that of all other observers, states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> that he has many times observed good
    effects from this step, especially with exotic genera, of which the
    fertility is somewhat impaired, such as Passiflora, Lobelia,
    Fuchsia. Herbert also says,<A href="#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> "I am
    inclined to think that I have derived advantage from impregnating
    the flower from which I wished to obtain seed with pollen from
    another individual of the same variety, or at least from another
    flower, rather than with its own." Again, Professor Lecoq
    ascertained that crossed offspring are more vigorous and robust
    than their parents.<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>General statements of this kind, however,
    can seldom be fully trusted: I therefore began a long series of
    experiments, continued for about ten years, which will I think
    conclusively show the good effects of crossing two distinct plants
    of the same variety, and the evil effects of long-continued
    self-fertilisation. A clear light will thus be thrown on such
    questions, as why flowers are almost invariably constructed so as
    to permit, or favour, or necessitate the union of two individuals.
    We shall clearly understand why mon&#339;cious and
    dioecious,&#8212;why dichogamous, dimorphic and trimorphic plants
    exist, and many other such cases. I intend soon to publish an
    account of these experiments, and I can here give only a few cases
    in illustration. The plan which I followed was to grow plants in
    the same pot, or in pots of the same size, or close together in the
    open ground; carefully to exclude insects; and then to fertilise
    some of the flowers with pollen from the same flower, and others on
    the same plant with pollen from a distinct but adjoining plant. In
    many of these experiments, the crossed plants yielded much more
    seed than the self-fertilised plants; and I have never seen the
    reversed case. The self-fertilised and crossed seeds thus obtained
    were allowed to germinate in the same glass vessel on damp sand;
    and as the seeds germinated, they were planted in pairs on opposite
    sides of the same pot, with a superficial partition between them,
    and were placed so as to be equally exposed to the light. In other
    cases the self-fertilised and crossed seeds were simply sown on
    opposite sides of the same small pot. I have, in short, followed
    different plans, but in every case have taken all the precautions
    which I could think of, so that the two lots should be equally
    favoured. The growth of the plants raised from the crossed and
    self-fertilised seed, were carefully observed from their
    germination to maturity, in species belonging to fifty-two genera;
    and the difference in their growth, and in withstanding
    unfavourable conditions, was in most cases manifest and strongly
    marked. It is of importance that the two lots of seed should be
    sown or planted on opposite sides of the same pot, so that the
    seedlings may struggle against each other; for if sown separately
    in ample and good soil, there is often but little difference in
    their growth.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will briefly describe two of the first
    cases observed by me. Six crossed and six self-fertilised seeds of
    <I>Ipomoea purpurea,</I> from plants treated in the manner above
    described, were planted as soon as they had germinated, in pairs on
    opposite sides of two pots, and rods of equal thickness were given
    them to twine up. Five of the crossed plants grew from the first
    more quickly than the opposed self-fertilised plants; the sixth,
    however, was weakly and was for a time beaten, but at last its
    sounder constitution prevailed and it shot ahead of its antagonist.
    As soon as each crossed plant reached the top of its seven-foot rod
    its fellow was measured, and the result was that, when the crossed
    plants were seven feet high the self-fertilised had attained the
    average height of only five feet four and a half inches. The
    crossed plants flowered a little before, and more profusely than
    the self-fertilised plants. On opposite sides of another <I>
    small</I> pot a large number of crossed and self-fertilised seeds
    were sown, so that they had to struggle for bare existence; a
    single rod was given to each lot: here again the crossed plants
    showed from the first their advantage; they never quite reached the
    summit of the seven-foot rod, but relatively to the self-fertilised
    plants their average height was as seven feet to five feet two
    inches. The experiment was repeated during several succeeding
    generations, treated in exactly the same manner, and with nearly
    the same result. In the second generation, the crossed plants,
    which were again crossed, produced 121 seed-capsules, whilst the
    self-fertilised, again self-fertilised, produced only 84
    capsules.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Some flowers of the <I>Mimulus luteus</I>
    were fertilised with their own pollen, and others were crossed with
    pollen from distinct plants growing in the same pot. The seeds were
    thickly sown on opposite sides of a pot. The seedlings were at
    first equal in height; but when the young crossed plants were half
    an inch, the self-fertilised plants were only a quarter of an inch
    high. But this degree of inequality did not last, for, when the
    crossed plants were four and a half inches high, the
    self-fertilised were three inches, and they retained the same
    relative difference till their growth was complete. The crossed
    plants looked far more vigorous than the uncrossed, and flowered
    before them; they produced also a far greater number of capsules.
    As in the former case, the experiment was repeated during several
    succeeding generations. Had I not watched these plants of Mimulus
    and Ipomoea during their whole growth, I could not have believed it
    possible, that a difference apparently so slight as that of the
    pollen being taken from the same flower, or from a distinct plant
    growing in the same pot, could have made so wonderful a difference
    in the growth and vigour of the plants thus produced. This, under a
    physiological point of view, is a most remarkable
    phenomenon.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the benefit derived from
    crossing distinct varieties, plenty of evidence has been published.
    Sageret<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> repeatedly speaks in
    strong terms of the vigour of melons raised by crossing different
    varieties, and adds that they are more easily fertilised than
    common melons, and produce numerous good seed. Here follows the
    evidence of an English gardener:<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
    "I have this summer met with better success in my cultivation of
    melons, in an unprotected state, from the seeds of hybrids
    (<I>i.e.</I> mongrels) obtained by cross impregnation, than with
    old varieties. The offspring of three different hybridisations (one
    more especially, of which the parents were the two most dissimilar
    varieties I could select) each yielded more ample and finer produce
    than any one of between twenty and thirty established
    varieties."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Andrew Knight<A href=

    extreme vigour of some of the crossed fruit-trees raised by
    Sageret.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>By crossing reciprocally the tallest and
    shortest peas, Knight<A href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> says: "I
    had in this experiment a striking instance of the stimulative
    effects of crossing the breeds; for the smallest variety, whose
    height rarely exceeded two feet, was increased to six feet: whilst
    the height of the large and luxuriant kind was very little
    diminished." Mr. Laxton gave me seed-peas produced from crosses
    between four distinct kinds; and the plants thus raised were
    extraordinarily vigorous, being in each case from one to two or
    three feet taller than the parent-forms growing close alongside
    them.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Wiegmann<A href=

    varieties of cabbage; and he speaks with astonishment of the vigour
    and height of the mongrels, which excited the amazement of all the
    gardeners who beheld them. Mr. Chaundy raised a great number of
    mongrels by planting together six distinct varieties of cabbage.
    These mongrels displayed an infinite diversity of character; "But
    the most remarkable circumstance was, that, while all the other
    cabbages and borecoles in the nursery were destroyed by a severe
    winter, these hybrids were little injured, and supplied the kitchen
    when there was no other cabbage to be had."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. Maund exhibited before the Royal
    Agricultural Society<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> specimens of

    states that they were intermediate in character, "united with that
    greater vigour of growth, which it appears, in the vegetable as in
    the animal world, is the result of a first cross." Knight also
    crossed several varieties of wheat,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> and he says "that in the years 1795 and
    1796, when almost the whole crop of corn in the island was
    blighted, the varieties thus obtained, and these only, escaped in
    this neighbourhood, though sown in several different soils and
    situations."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Here is a remarkable case: M. Clotzsch<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> crossed <I>Pinus sylvestris</I> and

    effusa</I>; and the cross-fertilised seeds, as well as seeds of the
    pure parent-trees, were all sown at the same time and in the same
    place. The result was, that after an interval of eight years, the
    hybrids were one-third taller than the pure trees!</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The facts above given refer to undoubted
    varieties, excepting the trees crossed by Clotzsch, which are
    ranked by various botanists as strongly-marked races, sub-species,

    species, though they lose in fertility, often gain in size and
    constitutional vigour, is certain. It would be superfluous to quote
    any facts; for all experimenters, Kolreuter, G&#228;rtner, Herbert,
    Sageret, Lecoq, and Naudin, have been struck with the wonderful
    vigour, height, size, tenacity of life, precocity, and hardiness of
    their hybrid productions. G&#228;rtner<A href=

    the strongest terms. K&#246;lreuter<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> gives numerous precise measurements of
    the weight and height of his hybrids in his comparison with
    measurements of both parent-forms; and speaks with astonishment of
    their <I>"statura portentosa,"</I> their <I>"ambitus vastissimus ac
    altitudo valde conspicua."</I> Some exceptions to the rule in the
    case of very sterile hybrids have, however, been noticed by
    G&#228;rtner and Herbert; but the most striking exceptions are
    given by Max Wichura<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> who found
    that hybrid willows were generally tender in constitution, dwarf,
    and short-lived.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Kolreuter explains the vast increase in
    the size of the roots, stems, etc., of his hybrids, as the result
    of a sort of compensation due to their sterility, in the same way
    as many emasculated animals are larger than the perfect males. This
    view seems at first sight extremely probable, and has been accepted
    by various authors;<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> but
    G&#228;rtner<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> has well remarked
    that there is much difficulty in fully admitting it; for with many
    hybrids there is no parallelism between the degree of their
    sterility and their increased size and vigour. The most striking
    instances of luxuriant growth have been observed with hybrids which
    were not sterile in any extreme degree. In the genus Mirabilis,
    certain hybrids are unusually fertile, and their extraordinary
    luxuriance of growth, together with their enormous roots<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> have been transmitted to their progeny.
    The result in all cases is probably in part due to the saving of
    nutriment and vital force through the sexual organs acting
    imperfectly or not at all, but more especially to the general law
    of good being derived from a cross. For it deserves especial
    attention that mongrel animals and plants, which are so far from
    being sterile that their fertility is often actually augmented,
    have, as previously shown, their size, hardiness, and
    constitutional vigour generally increased. It is not a little
    remarkable that an accession of vigour and size should thus arise
    under the opposite contingencies of increased and diminished
    fertility.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is a perfectly well ascertained fact<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> that hybrids invariably breed with
    either pure parent, and not rarely with a distinct species, more
    readily than with one another. Herbert is inclined to explain even
    this fact by the advantage derived from a cross; but G&#228;rtner
    more justly accounts for it by the pollen of the hybrid, and
    probably its ovules, being in some degree vitiated, whereas the
    pollen and ovules of both pure parents and of any third species are
    sound. Nevertheless, there are some well-ascertained and remarkable
    facts, which, as we shall presently see, show that a cross by
    itself undoubtedly tends to increase or re-establish the fertility
    of hybrids.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The same law, namely, that the crossed
    offspring both of varieties and species are larger than the
    parent-forms, holds good in the most striking manner with hybrid
    animals as well as with mongrels. Mr. Bartlett, who has had such
    large experience says, "Among all hybrids of vertebrated animals
    there is a marked increase of size." He then enumerates many cases
    with mammals, including monkeys, and with various families of
    birds.<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

      <I>On certain Hermaphrodite Plants which, either normally or
      abnormally, require to be fertilised by pollen from a distinct
      individual or species.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The facts now to be given differ from the
    foregoing, as self-sterility is not here the result of
    long-continued close interbreeding. These facts are, however,
    connected with our present subject, because a cross with a distinct
    individual is shown to be either necessary or advantageous.
    Dimorphic and trimorphic plants, though they are hermaphrodites,
    must be reciprocally crossed, one set of forms by the other, in
    order to be fully fertile, and in some cases to be fertile in any
    degree. But I should not have noticed these plants, had it not been
    for the following cases given by Dr. Hildebrand:&#8212;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Primula sinensis</I> is a reciprocally
    dimorphic species: Dr. Hildebrand fertilised twenty-eight flowers
    of both forms, each by pollen of the other form, and obtained the
    full number of capsules containing on an average 42&#183;7 seed per
    capsule; here we have complete and normal fertility. He then
    fertilised forty-two flowers of both forms with pollen of the same
    form, but taken from a distinct plant, and all produced capsules
    containing on an average only 19&#183;6 seed. Lastly, and here we
    come to our more immediate point, he fertilised forty-eight flowers
    of both forms with pollen of the same form and taken from the same
    flower, and now he obtained only thirty-two capsules, and these
    contained on an average 18&#183;6 seed, or one less per capsule
    than in the former case. So that, with these illegitimate unions,
    the act of impregnation is less assured, and the fertility slightly
    less, when the pollen and ovules belong to the same flower, than
    when belonging to two distinct individuals of the same form. Dr.
    Hildebrand has recently made analogous experiments on the
    long-styled form of <I>Oxalis rosea,</I> with the same result.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has recently been discovered that certain
    plants, whilst growing in their native country under natural
    conditions, cannot be fertilised with pollen from the same plant.
    They are sometimes so utterly self-impotent, that, though they can
    readily be fertilised by the pollen of a distinct species or even
    distinct genus, yet, wonderful as is the fact, they never produce a
    single seed by their own pollen. In some cases, moreover, the
    plant's own pollen and stigma mutually act on each other in a
    deleterious manner. Most of the facts to be given relate to
    orchids, but I will commence with a plant belonging to a widely
    different family.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Sixty-three flowers of <I>Corydalis
    cava,</I> borne on distinct plants, were fertilised by Dr.
    Hildebrand<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> with pollen from other
    plants of the same species; and fifty-eight capsules were obtained,
    including on an average 4.5 seed in each. He then fertilised
    sixteen flowers produced by the same raceme, one with another, but
    obtained only three capsules, one of which alone contained any good
    seeds, namely, two in number. Lastly, he fertilised twenty-seven
    flowers, each with its own pollen; he left also fifty-seven flowers
    to be spontaneously fertilised, and this would certainly have
    ensued if it had been possible, for the anthers not only touch the
    stigma, but the pollen-tubes were seen by Dr. Hildebrand to
    penetrate it; nevertheless these eighty-four flowers did not
    produce a single seed-capsule! This whole case is highly
    instructive, as it shows how widely different the action of the
    same pollen is, according as it is placed on the stigma of the same
    flower, or on that of another flower on the same raceme, or on that
    of a distinct plant.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With exotic Orchids several analogous
    cases have been observed, chiefly by Mr. John Scott.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> <I>Oncidium sphacelatum</I> has
    effective pollen, for Mr. Scott fertilised two distinct species
    with it; the ovules are likewise capable of impregnation, for they
    were readily fertilised by the pollen of <I>O. divaricatum</I>;
    nevertheless, between one and two hundred flowers fertilised by
    their own pollen did not produce a single capsule, though the
    stigmas were penetrated by the pollen-tubes. Mr. Robertson Munro,
    of the Royal Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh, also informs me (1864)
    that a hundred and twenty flowers of this same species were
    fertilised by him with their own pollen, and did not produce a
    capsule, but eight flowers, fertilised by the pollen of <I>O.
    divaricatum,</I> produced four fine capsules: again, between two
    and three hundred flowers of <I>O. divaricatum,</I> fertilised by
    their own pollen, did not set a capsule, but twelve flowers
    fertilised by <I>O. flexuosum</I> produced eight fine capsules: so
    that here we have three utterly self-impotent species, with their
    male and female organs perfect, as shown by their mutual
    fertilisation. In these cases fertilisation was effected only by
    the aid of a distinct species. But, as we shall presently see,
    distinct plants, raised from seed, of <I>Oncidium flexuosum,</I>
    and probably of the other species, would have been perfectly
    capable of fertilising each other, for this is the natural process.
    Again, Mr. Scott found that the pollen of a plant of <I>O.
    microchilum</I> was effective, for with it he fertilised two
    distinct species; he found its ovules good, for they could be
    fertilised by the pollen of one of these species, and by the pollen
    of a distinct plant of <I>O. microchilum</I>; but they could not be
    fertilised by pollen of the same plant, though the pollen-tubes
    penetrated the stigma. An analogous case has been recorded by M.
    Rivi&#232;re<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> with two plants of
    <I>O. cavendishianum,</I> which were both self-sterile, but
    reciprocally fertilised each other. All these cases refer to the
    genus Oncidium, but Mr. Scott found that <I>Maxillaria
    atro-rubens</I> was "totally insusceptible of fertilisation with
    its own pollen," but fertilised, and was fertilised by, a widely
    distinct species, viz. <I>M. squalens.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As these orchids had been grown under
    unnatural conditions in hot-houses, I concluded that their
    self-sterility was due to this cause. But Fritz M&#252;ller informs
    me that at Desterro, in Brazil, he fertilised above one hundred
    flowers of the above-mentioned <I>Oncidium flexuosum,</I> which is
    there endemic, with its own pollen, and with that taken from
    distinct plants: all the former were sterile, whilst those
    fertilised by pollen from any <I>other plant</I> of the same
    species were fertile. During the first three days there was no
    difference in the action of the two kinds of pollen: that placed on
    stigma of the same plant separated in the usual manner into grains,
    and emitted tubes which penetrated the column, and the stigmatic
    chamber shut itself; but only those flowers which had been
    fertilised by pollen taken from a distinct plant produced
    seed-capsules. On a subsequent occasion these experiments were
    repeated on a large scale with the same result. Fritz M&#252;ller
    found that four other endemic species of Oncidium were in like
    manner utterly sterile with their own pollen, but fertile with that
    from any other plant: some of them likewise produced seed-capsules
    when impregnated with pollen of widely distinct genera, such as
    Cyrtopodium, and Rodriguezia. <I>Oncidium crispum,</I> however,
    differs from the foregoing species in varying much in its
    self-sterility; some plants producing fine pods with their own
    pollen, others failing to do so in two or three instances, Fritz
    M&#252;ller observed that the pods produced by pollen taken from a
    distinct flower on the same plant, were larger than those produced
    by the flower's own pollen. In <I>Epidendrum cinnabarinum,</I> an
    orchid belonging to another division of the family, fine pods were
    produced by the plant's own pollen, but they contained by weight
    only about half as much seed as the capsules which had been
    fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant, and in one instance
    from a distinct species; moreover, a very large proportion, and in
    some cases nearly all the seeds produced by the plant's own pollen,
    were destitute of an embryo. Some self-fertilised capsules of a
    Maxillaria were in a similar state.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Another observation made by Fritz
    M&#252;ller is highly remarkable, namely, that with various orchids
    the plant's own pollen not only fails to impregnate the flower, but
    acts on the stigma, and is acted on, in an injurious or poisonous
    manner. This is shown by the surface of the stigma in contact with
    the pollen, and by the pollen itself becoming in from three to five
    days dark brown, and then decaying. The discoloration and decay are
    not caused by parasitic cryptograms, which were observed by Fritz
    M&#252;ller in only a single instance. These changes are well shown
    by placing on the same stigma, at the same time, the plant's own
    pollen and that from a distinct plant of the same species, or of
    another species, or even of another and widely remote genus. Thus,
    on the stigma of <I>Oncidium flexuosum,</I> the plant's own pollen
    and that from a distinct plant were placed side by side, and in
    five days' time the latter was perfectly fresh, whilst the plant's
    own pollen was brown. On the other hand, when the pollen of a
    distinct plant of the <I>Oncidium flexuosum</I> and of the <I>
    Epidendrum zebra (nov. spec.?)</I> were placed together on the same
    stigma, they behaved in exactly the same manner, the grains
    separating, emitting tubes, and penetrating the stigma, so that the
    two pollen-masses, after an interval of eleven days, could not be
    distinguished except by the difference of their caudicles, which,
    of course, undergo no change. Fritz M&#252;ller has, moreover, made
    a large number of crosses between orchids belonging to distinct
    species and genera, and he finds that in all cases when the flowers
    are not fertilised their footstalks first begin to wither; and the
    withering slowly spreads upwards until the germens fall off, after
    an interval of one or two weeks, and in one instance of between six
    and seven weeks; but even in this latter case, and in most other
    cases, the pollen and stigma remained in appearance fresh.
    Occasionally, however, the pollen becomes brownish, generally on
    the external surface, and not in contact with the stigma, as is
    invariably the case when the plant's own pollen is
    applied.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Fritz M&#252;ller observed the poisonous
    action of the plant's own pollen in the above-mentioned <I>Oncidium
    flexuosum, O. unicorne, pubes (?),</I> and in two other unnamed
    species. Also in two species of Rodriguezia, in two of Notylia, in
    one of Burlingtonia, and of a fourth genus in the same group. In
    all these cases, except the last, it was proved that the flowers
    were, as might have been expected, fertile with pollen from a
    distinct plant of the same species. Numerous flowers of one species
    of Notylia were fertilised with pollen from the same raceme; in two
    days' time they all withered, the germens began to shrink, the
    pollen-masses became dark brown, and not one pollen-grain emitted a
    tube. So that in this orchid the injurious action of the plant's
    own pollen is more rapid than with <I>Oncidium flexuosum.</I> Eight
    other flowers on the same raceme were fertilised with pollen from a
    distinct plant of the same species: two of these were dissected,
    and their stigmas were found to be penetrated by numberless
    pollen-tubes; and the germens of the other six flowers became well
    developed. On a subsequent occasion many other flowers were
    fertilised with their own pollen, and all fell off dead in a few
    days; whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had been left
    simply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh. We have seen
    that in cross-unions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen
    long remains undecayed; but Notylia behaved in this respect
    differently; for when its pollen was placed on the stigma of <I>
    Oncidium flexuosum,</I> both the stigma and pollen quickly became
    dark brown, in the same manner as if the plant's own pollen had
    been applied.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Fritz M&#252;ller suggests that, as in
    all these cases the plant's own pollen is not only impotent (thus
    effectually preventing self-fertilisation), but likewise prevents,
    as was ascertained in the case of the Notylia and <I>Oncidium
    flexuosum,</I> the action of subsequently applied pollen from a
    distinct individual, it would be an advantage to the plant to have
    its own pollen rendered more and more deleterious; for the germens
    would thus quickly be killed, and dropping off, there would be no
    further waste in nourishing a part which ultimately could be of no
    avail.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The same naturalist found in Brazil three
    plants of a Bignonia growing near together. He fertilised
    twenty-nine flowerets on one of them with their own pollen, and
    they did not set a single capsule. Thirty flowers were then
    fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant, one of the three, and
    they yielded only two capsules. Lastly, five flowers were
    fertilised with pollen from a fourth plant growing at a distance,
    and all five produced capsules. Fritz M&#252;ller thinks that the
    three plants which grew near one another were probably seedlings
    from the same parent, and that from being closely related, they
    acted very feebly on one another. This view is extremely probable,
    for he has since shown in a remarkable paper,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> that in the case of some Brazilian
    species of Abutilon, which are self-sterile, and between which he
    raised some complex hybrids, that these, if near relatives, were
    much less fertile <I>inter se,</I> than when not closely
    related.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We now come to cases closely analogous with
    those just given, but different in so far that only certain
    individuals of the species are self-sterile. This self-impotence
    does not depend on the pollen or ovules being in an unfit state for
    fertilisation, for both have been found effective in union with
    other plants of the same or of a distinct species. The fact of
    plants having acquired so peculiar a constitution, that they can be
    fertilised more readily by the pollen of a distinct species than by
    their own, is exactly the reverse of what occurs with all ordinary
    species. For in the latter the two sexual elements of the same
    individual plant are of course capable of freely acting on each
    other; but are so constituted that they are more or less impotent
    when brought into union with the sexual elements of a distinct
    species, and produce more or less sterile hybrids.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>G&#228;rtner experimented on two plants
    of <I>Lobelia fulgens,</I> brought from separate places, and
    found<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> that their pollen was good,
    for he fertilised with it <I>L. cardinalis</I> and <I>
    syphilitica</I>; their ovules were likewise good, for they were
    fertilised by the pollen of these same two species; but these two
    plants of <I>L. fulgens</I> could not be fertilised by their own
    pollen, as can generally be effected with perfect ease with this
    species. Again, the pollen of a plant of <I>Verbascum nigrum</I>
    grown in a pot was found by G&#228;rtner<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> capable of fertilising <I>V.
    lychnitis</I> and <I>V. austriacum</I>; the ovules could be
    fertilised by the pollen of <I>V. thapsus</I>; but the flowers
    could not be fertilised by their own pollen. K&#246;lreuter,
    also,<A href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> gives the case of three
    garden plants of <I>Verbascum ph&#339;niceum,</I> which bore during
    two years many flowers; these he fertilised successfully with the
    pollen of no less than four distinct species, but they produced not
    a seed with their own apparently good pollen; subsequently these
    same plants, and others raised from seed, assumed a strangely
    fluctuating condition, being temporarily sterile on the male or
    female side, or on both sides, and sometimes fertile on both sides;
    but two of the plants were perfectly fertile throughout the
    summer.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With <I>Reseda odorata</I> I have found
    certain individuals quite sterile with their own pollen, and so it
    is with the indigenous <I>Reseda lutea.</I> The self-sterile plants
    of both species were perfectly fertile when crossed with pollen
    from any other individual of the same species. These observations
    will hereafter be published in another work, in which I shall also
    show that seeds sent to me by Fritz M&#252;ller produced by plants
    of <I>Eschscholtzia californica</I> which were quite self-sterile
    in Brazil, yielded in this country plants which were only slightly
    self-sterile.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It appears<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> that certain flowers on certain plants
    of <I>Lilium candidum</I> can be fertilised more freely by pollen
    from a distinct individual than by their own. So, again, with the
    varieties of the potato. Tinzmann,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> who made many trials with this plant,
    says that pollen from another variety sometimes "exerts a powerful
    influence, and I have found sorts of potatoes which would not bear
    seed from impregnation with the pollen of their own flowers would
    bear it when impregnated with other pollen." It does not, however,
    appear to have been proved that the pollen which failed to act on
    the flower's own stigma was in itself good.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the genus Passiflora it has long been
    known that several species do not produce fruit, unless fertilised
    by pollen taken from distinct species: thus, Mr. Mowbray<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> found that he could not get fruit from
    <I>P. alata</I> and <I>racemosa</I> except by reciprocally
    fertilising them with each other's pollen; and similar facts have
    been observed in Germany and France.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A> I have received two accounts of <I>P.
    quadrangularis</I> never producing fruit from its own pollen, but
    doing so freely when fertilised in one case with the pollen of <I>
    P. c&#339;rulea,</I> and in another case with that of <I>P.
    edulis.</I> But in three other cases this species fruited freely
    when fertilised with its own pollen; and the writer in one case
    attributed the favourable result to the temperature of the house
    having been raised from 5&#176; to 10&#176; Fahr. above the former
    temperature, after the flowers were fertilised.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> With respect to <I>P. laurifolia,</I> a
    cultivator of much experience has recently remarked<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> that the flowers "must be fertilised
    with the pollen of <I>P. c&#339;rulea,</I> or of some other common
    kind, as their own pollen will not fertilise them." But the fullest
    details on this subject have been given by Messrs. Scott and
    Robertson Munro:<A href="#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> plants of <I>
    Passiflora racemosa, c&#339;rulea,</I> and <I>alata</I> flowered
    profusely during many years in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh,
    and, though repeatedly fertilised with their own pollen, never
    produced any seed; yet this occurred at once with all three species
    when they were crossed together in various ways. In the case of <I>
    P. c&#339;rulea</I> three plants, two of which grew in the Botanic
    Gardens, were all rendered fertile, merely by impregnating each
    with pollen of one of the others. The same result was attained in
    the same manner with <I>P. alata,</I> but with only one plant out
    of three. As so many self-sterile species of Passiflora have been
    mentioned, it should be stated that the flowers of the annual <I>P.
    gracilis</I> are nearly as fertile with their own pollen as with
    that from a distinct plant; thus sixteen flowers spontaneously
    self-fertilised produced fruit, each containing on an average
    21&#183;3 seed, whilst fruit from fourteen crossed flowers
    contained 24&#183;1 seed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Returning to <I>P. alata,</I> I have
    received (1866) some interesting details from Mr. Robertson Munro.
    Three plants, including one in England, have already been mentioned
    which were inveterately self-sterile, and Mr. Munro informs me of
    several others which, after repeated trials during many years, have
    been found in the same predicament. At some other places, however,
    this species fruits readily when fertilised with its own pollen. At
    Taymouth Castle there is a plant which was formerly grafted by Mr.
    Donaldson on a distinct species, name unknown, and ever since the
    operation it has produced fruit in abundance by its own pollen; so
    that this small and unnatural change in the state of this plant has
    restored its self-fertility! Some of the seedlings from the
    Taymouth Castle plant were found to be not only sterile with their
    own pollen, but with each other's pollen, and with the pollen of
    distinct species. Pollen from the Taymouth plant failed to
    fertilise certain plants of the same species, but was successful on
    one plant in the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens. Seedlings were raised
    from this latter union, and some of their flowers were fertilised
    by Mr. Munro with their own pollen; but they were found to be as
    self-impotent as the mother-plant had always proved, except when
    fertilised by the grafted Taymouth plant, and except, as we shall
    see, when fertilised by her own seedlings. For Mr. Munro fertilised
    eighteen flowers on the self-impotent mother-plant with pollen from
    these her own self-impotent seedlings, and obtained, remarkable as
    the fact is, eighteen fine capsules full of excellent seed! I have
    met with no case in regard to plants which shows so well as this of
    <I>P. alata,</I> on what small and mysterious causes complete
    fertility or complete sterility depends.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The facts hitherto given relate to the
    much-lessened or completely destroyed fertility of pure species
    when impregnated with their own pollen, in comparison with their
    fertility when impregnated by distinct individuals or distinct
    species; but closely analogous facts have been observed with
    hybrids.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Herbert states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> that having in flower at the same time
    nine hybrid Hippeastrums, of complicated origin, descended from
    several species, he found that "almost every flower touched with
    pollen from another cross produced seed abundantly, and those which
    were touched with their own pollen either failed entirely, or
    formed slowly a pod of inferior size, with fewer seeds." In the
    'Horticultural Journal' he adds that "the admission of the pollen
    of another cross-bred Hippeastrum (however complicated the cross)
    to any one flower of the number, is almost sure to check the
    fructification of the others." In a letter written to me in 1839,
    Dr. Herbert says that he had already tried these experiments during
    five consecutive years, and he subsequently repeated them, with the
    same invariable result. He was thus led to make an analogous trial
    on a pure species, namely, on the <I>Hippeastrum aulicum,</I> which
    he had lately imported from Brazil: this bulb produced four
    flowers, three of which were fertilised by their own pollen, and
    the fourth by the pollen of a triple cross between <I>H.
    bulbulosum, regin&#230;,</I> and <I>vittatum</I>; the result was,
    that "the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow,
    and after a few days perished entirely: whereas the pod impregnated
    by the hybrid made vigorous and rapid progress to maturity, and
    bore good seed, which vegetated freely." This is, indeed, as
    Herbert remarks, "a strange truth," but not so strange as it then
    appeared.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As a confirmation of these statements, I
    may add that Mr. M. Mayes<A href="#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> after
    much experience in crossing the species of Amaryllis (Hippeastrum),
    says, "neither the species nor the hybrids will, we are well aware,
    produce seed so abundantly from their own pollen as from that of
    others." So, again, Mr. Bidwell, in New South Wales<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> asserts that <I>Amaryllis belladonna</I>
    bears many more seeds when fertilised by the pollen of <I>
    Brunswigia</I> (<I>Amaryllis</I> of some authors) <I>
    josephin&#230;</I> or of <I>B. multiflora,</I> than when fertilised
    by its own pollen. Mr. Beaton dusted four flowers of a Cyrtanthus
    with their own pollen, and four with the pollen of <I>Vallota
    (Amaryllis) purpurea</I>; on the seventh day "those which received
    their own pollen slackened their growth, and ultimately perished;
    those which were crossed with the Vallota held on."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> These latter cases, however, relate to
    uncrossed species, like those before given with respect to
    Passiflora, Orchids, etc., and are here referred to only because
    the plants belong to the same group of
    Amaryllidace&#230;.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the experiments on the hybrid
    Hippeastrums, if Herbert had found that the pollen of two or three
    kinds alone had been more efficient on certain kinds than their own
    pollen, it might have been argued that these, from their mixed
    parentage, had a closer mutual affinity than the others; but this
    explanation is inadmissible, for the trials were made reciprocally
    backwards and forwards on nine different hybrids; and a cross,
    whichever way taken, always proved highly beneficial. I can add a
    striking and analogous case from experiments made by the Rev. A.
    Rawson, of Bromley Common, with some complex hybrids of Gladiolus.
    This skilful horticulturist possessed a number of French varieties,
    differing from each other only in the colour and size of the
    flowers, all descended from Gandavensis, a well-known old hybrid,
    said to be descended from <I>G. natalensis</I> by the pollen of <I>
    G. oppositiflorus.</I><A href="#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> Mr.
    Rawson, after repeated trials, found that none of the varieties
    would set seed with their own pollen, although taken from distinct
    plants of the same variety (which had, of course, been propagated
    by bulbs), but that they all seeded freely with pollen from any
    other variety. To give two examples: Ophir did not produce a
    capsule with its own pollen, but when fertilised with that of
    Janire, Brenchleyensis, Vulcain and Linn&#233;, it produced ten
    fine capsules; but the pollen of Ophir was good, for when
    Linn&#233; was fertilised by it seven capsules were produced. This
    latter variety, on the other hand, was utterly barren with its own
    pollen, which we have seen was perfectly efficient on Ophir.
    Altogether, Mr. Rawson, in the year 1861 fertilised twenty-six
    flowers borne by four varieties with pollen taken from other
    varieties, and every single flower produced a fine seed-capsule;
    whereas fifty-two flowers on the same plants, fertilised at the
    same time with their own pollen, did not yield a single
    seed-capsule. Mr. Rawson fertilised, in some cases, the alternate
    flowers, and in other cases all those down one side of the spike,
    with pollen of other varieties, and the remaining flowers with
    their own pollen. I saw these plants when the capsules were nearly
    mature, and their curious arrangement at once brought full
    conviction to the mind that an immense advantage had been derived
    from crossing these hybrids.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Lastly, I have heard from Dr. E. Bornet,
    of Antibes, who has made numerous experiments in crossing the
    species of Cistus, but has not yet published the results, that,
    when any of these hybrids are fertile, they may be said to be, in
    regard to function, dioecious; "for the flowers are always sterile
    when the pistil is fertilised by pollen taken from the same flower
    or from flowers on the same plant. But they are often fertile if
    pollen be employed from a distinct individual of the same hybrid
    nature, or from a hybrid made by a reciprocal cross."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Conclusion.</I>&#8212;That plants should be
    self-sterile, although both sexual elements are in a fit state for
    reproduction, appears at first sight opposed to all analogy. With
    respect to the species, all the individuals of which are in this
    state, although living under their natural conditions, we may
    conclude that their self-sterility has been acquired for the sake
    of effectually preventing self-fertilisation. The case is closely
    analogous with that of dimorphic and trimorphic or heterostyled
    plants, which can be fully fertilised only by plants belonging to a
    different form, and not, as in the foregoing cases, indifferently
    by any other individual of the species. Some of these hetero-styled
    plants are completely sterile with pollen taken from the same plant
    or from the same form. With respect to species living under their
    natural conditions, of which only certain individuals are
    self-sterile (as with <I>Reseda lutea</I>), it is probable that
    these have been rendered self-sterile to ensure occasional
    cross-fertilisation, whilst other individuals have remained
    self-fertile to ensure the propagation of the species. The case
    seems to be parallel with that of plants which produce, as Hermann
    M&#252;ller has discovered, two forms&#8212;one bearing more
    conspicuous flowers with their structure adapted for
    cross-fertilisation by insects, and the other form with less
    conspicuous flowers adapted for self-fertilisation. The
    self-sterility, however, of some of the foregoing plants is
    incidental on the conditions to which they have been subjected, as
    with the Eschscholtzia, the <I>Verbascum ph&#339;niceum</I> (the
    sterility of which varied according to the season), and with the
    <I>Passiflora alata,</I> which recovered its self-fertility when
    grafted on a different stock.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to observe in the above
    several cases the graduated series from plants which, when
    fertilised by their own pollen, yield the full number of seeds, but
    with the seedlings a little dwarfed in stature&#8212;to plants
    which when self-fertilised yield few seeds&#8212;to those which
    yield none, but have their ovaria somewhat developed&#8212;and,
    lastly, to those in which the plant's own pollen and stigma
    mutually act on one another like poison. It is also interesting to
    observe on how slight a difference in the nature of the pollen or
    of the ovules complete self-sterility or complete self-fertility
    must depend in some of the above cases. Every individual of the
    self-sterile species appears to be capable of producing the full
    complement of seed when fertilised by the pollen of any other
    individual (though judging from the facts given with respect to
    Abutilon the nearest kin must be excepted); but not one individual
    can be fertilised by its own pollen. As every organism differs in
    some slight degree from every other individual of the same species,
    so no doubt it is with their pollen and ovules; and in the above
    cases we must believe that complete self-sterility and complete
    self-fertility depend on such slight differences in the ovules and
    pollen, and not their having been differentiated in some special
    manner in relation to one another; for it is impossible that the
    sexual elements of many thousand individuals should have been
    specialised in relation to every other individual. In some,
    however, of the above cases, as with certain Passifloras, an amount
    of differentiation between the pollen and ovules sufficient for
    fertilisation is gained only by employing pollen from a distinct
    species; but this is probably the result of such plants having been
    rendered somewhat sterile from the unnatural conditions to which
    they have been exposed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Exotic animals confined in menageries are
    sometimes in nearly the same state as the above-described
    self-impotent plants; for, as we shall see in the following
    chapter, certain monkeys, the larger carnivora, several finches,
    geese, and pheasants, cross together, quite as freely as, or even
    more freely than the individuals of the same species breed
    together. Cases will, also, be given of sexual incompatibility
    between certain, male and female domesticated animals, which,
    nevertheless, are fertile when matched with any other individual of
    the same kind.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the early part of this chapter it was shown
    that the crossing of individuals belonging to distinct families of
    the same race, or to different races or species, gives increased
    size and constitutional vigour to the offspring, and, except in the
    case of crossed species, increased fertility. The evidence rests on
    the universal testimony of breeders (for it should be observed that
    I am not here speaking of the evil results of close interbreeding),
    and is practically exemplified in the higher value of cross-bred
    animals for immediate consumption. The good results of crossing
    have also been demonstrated with some animals and with numerous
    plants, by actual weight and measurement. Although animals of pure
    blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing, as far as their
    characteristic qualities are concerned, there seems to be no
    exception to the rule that advantages of the kind just mentioned
    are thus gained, even when there has not been any previous close
    interbreeding; and the rule applies to such animals as cattle and
    sheep, which can long resist breeding in-and-in between the nearest
    blood-relations.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the case of crossed species, although size,
    vigour, precocity, and hardiness are, with rare exceptions, gained,
    fertility, in a greater or less degree, is lost; but the gain in
    the above respects can hardly be attributed to the principle of
    compensation; for there is no close parallelism between the
    increased size and vigour of hybrid offspring and their sterility.
    Moreover, it has been clearly proved that mongrels which are
    perfectly fertile gain these same advantages as well as sterile
    hybrids.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With the higher animals no special adaptations
    for ensuring occasional crosses between distinct families seem to
    exist. The eagerness of the males, leading to severe competition
    between them, is sufficient; for even with gregarious animals, the
    old and dominant males will be dispossessed after a time and it
    would be a mere chance if a closely related member of the same
    family were to be the victorious successor. The structure of many
    of the lower animals, when they are hermaphrodites, is such as to
    prevent the ovules being fertilised by the male element of the same
    individual; so that the concourse of two individuals is necessary.
    In other cases the access of the male element of a distinct
    individual is at least possible. With plants, which are affixed to
    the ground and cannot wander from place to place like animals, the
    numerous adaptations for cross-fertilisation are wonderfully
    perfect, as has been admitted by every one who has studied the
    subject.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The evil consequences of long-continued close
    interbreeding are not so easily recognised as the good effects from
    crossing, for the deterioration is gradual. Nevertheless, it is the
    general opinion of those who have had most experience, especially
    with animals which propagate quickly, that evil does inevitably
    follow sooner or later, but at different rates with different
    animals. No doubt a false belief may, like a superstition, prevail
    widely; yet it is difficult to suppose that so many acute observers
    have all been deceived at the expense of much cost and trouble. A
    male animal may sometimes be paired with his daughter,
    granddaughter, and so on, even for seven generations, without any
    manifest bad result: but the experiment has never been tried of
    matching brothers and sisters, which is considered the closest form
    of interbreeding, for an equal number of generations. There is good
    reason to believe that by keeping the members of the same family in
    distinct bodies, especially if exposed to somewhat different
    conditions of life, and by occasionally crossing these families,
    the evil results of interbreeding may be much diminished or quite
    eliminated. These results are loss of constitutional vigour, size,
    and fertility; but there is no necessary deterioration in the
    general form of the body, or in other good qualities. We have seen
    that with pigs first-rate animals have been produced after
    long-continued close interbreeding, though they had become
    extremely infertile when paired with their near relations. The loss
    of fertility, when it occurs, seems never to be absolute, but only
    relative to animals of the same blood; so that this sterility is to
    a certain extent analogous with that of self-impotent plants which
    cannot be fertilised by their own pollen, but are perfectly fertile
    with pollen of any other individual of the same species. The fact
    of infertility of this peculiar nature being one of the results of
    long-continued interbreeding, shows that interbreeding does not act
    merely by combining and augmenting various morbid tendencies common
    to both parents; for animals with such tendencies, if not at the
    time actually ill, can generally propagate their kind. Although
    offspring descended from the nearest blood-relations are not
    necessarily deteriorated in structure, yet some authors believe
    that they are eminently liable to malformations; and this is not
    improbable, as everything which lessens the vital powers acts in
    this manner. Instances of this kind have been recorded in the case
    of pigs, bloodhounds, and some other animals.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, when we consider the various facts now
    given which plainly show that good follows from crossing, and less
    plainly that evil follows from close interbreeding, and when we
    bear in mind that with very many organisms elaborate provisions
    have been made for the occasional union of distinct individuals,
    the existence of a great law of nature is almost proved; namely,
    that the crossing of animals and plants which are not closely
    related to each other is highly beneficial or even necessary, and
    that interbreeding prolonged during many generations is
    injurious.</P>
