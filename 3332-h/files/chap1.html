    <P align="JUSTIFY">The first and chief point of interest in this
    chapter is, whether the numerous domesticated varieties of the dog
    have descended from a single wild species, or from several. Some
    authors believe that all have descended from the wolf, or from the
    jackal, or from an unknown and extinct species. Others again
    believe, and this of late has been the favourite tenet, that they
    have descended from several species, extinct and recent, more or
    less commingled together. We shall probably never be able to
    ascertain their origin with certainty. Pal&#230;ontology<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> does not throw much light on the
    question, owing, on the one hand, to the close similarity of the
    skulls of extinct as well as living wolves and jackals, and owing,
    on the other hand, to the great dissimilarity of the skulls of the
    several breeds of the domestic dogs. It seems, however, that
    remains have been found in the later tertiary deposits more like
    those of a large dog than of a wolf, which favours the belief of De
    Blainville that our dogs are the descendants of a single extinct
    species. On the other hand, some authors go so far as to assert
    that every chief domestic breed must have had its wild prototype.
    This latter view is extremely improbable: it allows nothing for
    variation; it passes over the almost monstrous character of some of
    the breeds; and it almost necessarily assumes that a large number
    of species have become extinct since man domesticated the dog;
    whereas we plainly see that wild members of the dog-family are
    extirpated by human agency with much difficulty; even so recently
    as 1710 the wolf existed in so small an island as Ireland.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The reasons which have led various authors to
    infer that our dogs have descended from more than one wild species
    are as follows.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Firstly, the great
    difference between the several breeds; but this will appear of
    comparatively little weight, after we shall have seen how great are
    the differences between the several races of various domesticated
    animals which certainly have descended from a single parent-form.
    Secondly, the more important fact, that, at the most anciently
    known historical periods, several breeds of the dog existed, very
    unlike each other, and closely resembling or identical with breeds
    still alive.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We will briefly run back through the historical
    records. The materials are remarkably deficient between the
    fourteenth century and the Roman classical period.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> At this latter period various breeds,
    namely hounds, house-dogs, lapdogs, etc, existed; but, as Dr.
    Walther has remarked, it is impossible to recognise the greater
    number with any certainty. Youatt, however, gives a drawing of a
    beautiful sculpture of two greyhound puppies from the Villa of
    Antoninus. On an Assyrian monument, about 640 <SMALL>B.C.,</SMALL>
    an enormous mastiff<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> is figured;
    and according to Sir H. Rawlinson (as I was informed at the British
    Museum), similar dogs are still imported into this same country. I
    have looked through the magnificent works of Lepsius and Rosellini,
    and on the Egyptian monuments from the fourth to the twelfth
    dynasties (i.e. from about 3400 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL> to 2100 <SMALL>
    B.C.</SMALL>) several varieties of the dog are represented; most of
    them are allied to greyhounds; at the later of these periods a dog
    resembling a hound is figured, with drooping ears, but with a
    longer back and more pointed head than in our hounds. There is,
    also, a turnspit, with short and crooked legs, closely resembling
    the existing variety; but this kind of monstrosity is so common
    with various animals, as with the ancon sheep, and even, according
    to Rengger, with jaguars in Paraguay, that it would be rash to look
    at the monumental animal as the parent of all our turnspits:
    Colonel Sykes<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> also has described
    an Indian pariah dog as presenting the same monstrous character.
    The most ancient dog represented on the Egyptian monuments is one
    of the most singular; it resembles a greyhound, but has long
    pointed ears and a short curled tail: a closely allied variety
    still exists in Northern Africa; for Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> states that the Arab boar-hound is "an
    eccentric hieroglyphic animal, such as Cheops once hunted with,
    somewhat resembling the rough Scotch deer-hound; their tails are
    curled tight round on their backs, and their ears stick out at
    right angles." With this most ancient variety a pariah-like dog
    coexisted.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We thus see that, at a period between four and
    five thousand years ago, various breeds, viz. pariah dogs,
    greyhounds, common hounds, mastiffs, house-dogs, lapdogs, and
    turnspits, existed, more or less closely resembling our present
    breeds. But there is not sufficient evidence that any of these
    ancient dogs belonged to the same identical sub-varieties with our
    present dogs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> As long as man was
    believed to have existed on this earth only about 6000 years, this
    fact of the great diversity of the breeds at so early a period was
    an argument of much weight that they had proceeded from several
    wild sources, for there would not have been sufficient time for
    their divergence and modification. But now that we know, from the
    discovery of flint tools embedded with the remains of extinct
    animals in districts which have since undergone great geographical
    changes, that man has existed for an incomparably longer period,
    and bearing in mind that the most barbarous nations possess
    domestic dogs, the argument from insufficient time falls away
    greatly in value.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Long before the period of any historical record
    the dog was domesticated in Europe. In the Danish Middens of the
    Neolithic or Newer Stone period, bones of a canine animal are
    embedded, and Steenstrup ingeniously argues that these belonged to
    a domestic dog; for a very large proportion of the bones of birds
    preserved in the refuse consists of long bones, which it was found
    on trial dogs cannot devour.<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> This
    ancient dog was succeeded in Denmark during the Bronze period by a
    larger kind, presenting certain differences, and this again during
    the Iron period, by a still larger kind. In Switzerland, we hear
    from Prof. R&#252;timeyer,<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> that
    during the Neolithic period a domesticated dog of middle size
    existed, which in its skull was about equally remote from the wolf
    and jackal, and partook of the characters of our hounds and setters
    or spaniels (Jagdhund und Wachtelhund). R&#252;timeyer insists
    strongly on the constancy of form during a very long period of time
    of this the most ancient known dog. During the Bronze period a
    larger dog appeared, and this closely resembled in its jaw a dog of
    the same age in Denmark. Remains of two notably distinct varieties
    of the dog were found by Schmerling in a cave;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> but their age cannot be positively
    determined.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The existence of a single race, remarkably
    constant in form during the whole Neolithic period, is an
    interesting fact in contrast with what we see of the changes which
    the races underwent during the period of the successive Egyptian
    monuments, and in contrast with our existing dogs. The character of
    this animal during the Neolithic period, as given by
    R&#252;timeyer, supports De Blainville's view that our varieties
    have descended from an unknown and extinct form. But we should not
    forget that we know nothing with respect to the antiquity of man in
    the warmer parts of the world. The succession of the different
    kinds of dogs in Switzerland and Denmark is thought to be due to
    the immigration of conquering tribes bringing with them their dogs;
    and this view accords with the belief that different wild canine
    animals were domesticated in different regions. Independently of
    the immigration of new races of man, we know from the wide-spread
    presence of bronze, composed of an alloy of tin, how much commerce
    there must have been throughout Europe at an extremely remote
    period, and dogs would then probably have been bartered. At the
    present time, amongst the savages of the interior of Guiana, the
    Taruma Indians are considered the best trainers of dogs, and
    possess a large breed which they barter at a high price with other
    tribes.<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The main argument in favour of the several
    breeds of the dog being the descendants of distinct wild stocks, is
    their resemblance in various countries to distinct species still
    existing there. It must, however, be admitted that the comparison
    between the wild and domesticated animal has been made but in few
    cases with sufficient exactness. Before entering on details, it
    will be well to show that there is no a priori difficulty in the
    belief that several canine species have been domesticated. Members
    of the dog family inhabit nearly the whole world; and several
    species agree pretty closely in habits and structure with our
    several domesticated dogs. Mr. Galton has shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> how fond savages are of keeping and
    taming animals of all kinds. Social animals are the most easily
    subjugated by man, and several species of Canid&#230; hunt in
    packs. It deserves notice, as bearing on other animals as well as
    on the dog, that at an extremely ancient period, when man first
    entered any country, the animals living there would have felt no
    instinctive or inherited fear of him, and would consequently have
    been tamed far more easily than at present. For instance, when the
    Falkland Islands were first visited by man, the large wolf-like dog
    (<I>Canis antarcticus</I>) fearlessly came to meet Byron's sailors,
    who, mistaking this ignorant curiosity for ferocity, ran into the
    water to avoid them: even recently a man, by holding a piece of
    meat in one hand and a knife in the other, could sometimes stick
    them at night. On a island in the Sea of Aral, when first
    discovered by Butakoff, the saigak antelopes, which are "generally
    very timid and watchful, did not fly from us, but on the contrary
    looked at us with a sort of curiosity." So, again, on the shores of
    the Mauritius, the manatee was not at first in the least afraid of
    man, and thus it has been in several quarters of the world with
    seals and the morse. I have elsewhere shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> how slowly the native birds of several
    islands have acquired and inherited a salutary dread of man: at the
    Galapagos Archipelago I pushed with the muzzle of my gun hawks from
    a branch, and held out a pitcher of water for other birds to alight
    on and drink. Quadrupeds and birds which have seldom been disturbed
    by man, dread him no more than do our English birds, the cows, or
    horses grazing in the fields.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is a more important consideration that
    several canine species evince (as will be shown in a future
    chapter) no strong repugnance or inability to breed under
    confinement; and the incapacity to breed under confinement is one
    of the commonest bars to domestication. Lastly, savages set the
    highest value, as we shall see in the chapter on Selection, on
    dogs: even half-tamed animals are highly useful to them: the
    Indians of North America cross their half-wild dogs with wolves,
    and thus render them even wilder than before, but bolder: the
    savages of Guiana catch and partially tame and use the whelps of
    two wild species of <I>Canis,</I> as do the savages of Australia
    those of the wild Dingo. Mr. Philip King informs me that he once
    trained a wild Dingo puppy to drive cattle, and found it very
    useful. From these several considerations we see that there is no
    difficulty in believing that man might have domesticated various
    canine species in different countries. It would indeed have been a
    strange fact if one species alone had been domesticated throughout
    the world.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We will now enter into details. The accurate and
    sagacious Richardson says, "The resemblance between the Northern
    American wolves (<I>Canis lupus,</I> var. <I>occidentalis</I>) and
    the domestic dogs of the Indians is so great that the size and
    strength of the wolf seems to be the only difference. I have more
    than once mistaken a band of wolves for the dogs of a party of
    Indians; and the howl of the animals of both species is prolonged
    so exactly in the same key that even the practised ear of the
    Indian fails at times to discriminate them." He adds that the more
    northern Esquimaux dogs are not only extremely like the grey wolves
    of the Arctic circle in form and colour, but also nearly equal them
    in size. Dr. Kane has often seen in his teams of sledge-dogs the
    oblique eye (a character on which some naturalists lay great
    stress), the drooping tail, and scared look of the wolf. In
    disposition the Esquimaux dogs differ little from wolves, and,
    according to Dr. Hayes, they are capable of no attachment to man,
    and are so savage that when hungry they will attack even their
    masters. According to Kane they readily become feral. Their
    affinity is so close with wolves that they frequently cross with
    them, and the Indians take the whelps of wolves "to improve the
    breed of their dogs." The half-bred wolves sometimes
    (Lamare-Picquot) cannot be tamed, "though this case is rare;" but
    they do not become thoroughly well broken in till the second or
    third generation. These facts show that there can be but little, if
    any, sterility between the Esquimaux dog and the wolf, for
    otherwise they would not be used to improve the breed. As Dr. Hayes
    says of these dogs, "reclaimed wolves they doubtless are."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">North America is inhabited by a second kind of
    wolf, the prairie-wolf (<I>Canis latrans</I>), which is now looked
    at by all naturalists as specifically distinct from the common
    wolf; and is, according to Mr. J.K. Lord, in some respects
    intermediate in habits between a wolf and a fox. Sir J. Richardson,
    after describing the Hare Indian dog, which differs in many
    respects from the Esquimaux dog, says, "It bears the same relation
    to the prairie-wolf that the Esquimaux dog does to the great grey
    wolf." He could, in fact, detect no marked difference between them;
    and Messrs. Nott and Gliddon give additional details showing their
    close resemblance. The dogs derived from the above two aboriginal
    sources cross together and with the wild wolves, at least with the
    <I>C. occidentalis,</I> and with European dogs. In Florida,
    according to Bartram, the black wolf-dog of the Indians differs in
    nothing from the wolves of that country except in barking.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Turning to the southern parts of the new world,
    Columbus found two kinds of dogs in the West Indies; and
    Fernandez<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> describes three in
    Mexico: some of these native dogs were dumb&#8212;that is, did not
    bark. In Guiana it has been known since the time of Buffon that the
    natives cross their dogs with an aboriginal species, apparently the
    <I>Canis cancrivorus.</I> Sir R. Schomburgk, who has so carefully
    explored these regions, writes to me, "I have been repeatedly told
    by the Arawaak Indians, who reside near the coast, that they cross
    their dogs with a wild species to improve the breed, and individual
    dogs have been shown to me which certainly resembled the <I>C.
    cancrivorus</I> much more than the common breed. It is but seldom
    that the Indians keep the <I>C. cancrivorus</I> for domestic
    purposes, nor is the Ai, another species of wild dog, and which I
    consider to be identical with the <I>Dusicyon silvestris</I> of H.
    Smith, now much used by the Arecunas for the purpose of hunting.
    The dogs of the Taruma Indians are quite distinct, and resemble
    Buffon's St. Domingo greyhound." It thus appears that the natives
    of Guiana have partially domesticated two aboriginal species, and
    still cross their dogs with them; these two species belong to a
    quite different type from the North American and European wolves. A
    careful observer, Rengger,<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> gives
    reasons for believing that a hairless dog was domesticated when
    America was first visited by Europeans: some of these dogs in
    Paraguay are still dumb, and Tschudi<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> states that they suffer from cold in the
    Cordillera. This naked dog is, however quite distinct from that
    found preserved in the ancient Peruvian burial-places, and
    described by Tschudi, under the name of <I>Canis ing&#230;,</I> as
    withstanding cold well and as barking. It is not known whether
    these two distinct kinds of dog are the descendants of native
    species, and it might be argued that when man first migrated into
    America he brought with him from the Asiatic continent dogs which
    had not learned to bark; but this view does not seem probable, as
    the natives along the line of their march from the north reclaimed,
    as we have seen, at least two N. American species of
    Canid&#230;.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Turning to the Old World, some European dogs
    closely resemble the wolf; thus the shepherd dog of the plains of
    Hungary is white or reddish-brown, has a sharp nose, short, erect
    ears, shaggy coat, and bushy tail, and so much resembles a wolf
    that Mr. p.t, who gives this description, says he has known a
    Hungarian mistake a wolf for one of his own dogs. Jeitteles, also,
    remarks on the close similarity of the Hungarian dog and wolf.
    Shepherd dogs in Italy must anciently have closely resembled
    wolves, for Columella (vii. 12) advises that white dogs be kept,
    adding, "pastor album probat, ne pro lupo canem feriat." Several
    accounts have been given of dogs and wolves crossing naturally; and
    Pliny asserts that the Gauls tied their female dogs in the woods
    that they might cross with wolves.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> The European wolf differs slightly from
    that of North America, and has been ranked by many naturalists as a
    distinct species. The common wolf of India is also by some esteemed
    as a third species, and here again we find a marked resemblance
    between the pariah dogs of certain districts of India and the
    Indian wolf.<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to Jackals, Isidore Geoffroy
    Saint-Hilaire<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> says that not one
    constant difference can be pointed out between their structure and
    that of the smaller races of dogs. They agree closely in habits:
    jackals, when tamed and called by their master, wag their tails,
    lick his hands, crouch, and throw themselves on their backs; they
    smell at the tails of other dogs, and void their urine sideways;
    they roll on carrion or on animals which they have killed; and,
    lastly, when in high spirits, they run round in circles or in a
    figure of eight, with their tails between their legs.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> A number of excellent naturalists, from
    the time of G&#252;ldenst&#228;dt to that of Ehrenberg, Hemprich,
    and Cretzschmar, have expressed themselves in the strongest terms
    with respect to the resemblance of the half-domestic dogs of Asia
    and Egypt to jackals. M. Nordmann, for instance, says, "Les chiens
    d'Awhasie ressemblent &#233;tonnamment &#224; des chacals."
    Ehrenberg<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> asserts that the
    domestic dogs of Lower Egypt, and certain mummied dogs, have for
    their wild type a species of wolf (<I>C. lupaster</I>) of the
    country; whereas the domestic dogs of Nubia and certain other
    mummied dogs have the closest relation to a wild species of the
    same country, viz. <I>C. sabbar,</I> which is only a form of the
    common jackal. Pallas asserts that jackals and dogs sometimes
    naturally cross in the East; and a case is on record in Algeria.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> The greater number of naturalists
    divide the jackals of Asia and Africa into several species, but
    some few rank them all as one.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I may add that the domestic dogs on the coast of
    Guinea are fox-like animals, and are dumb.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> On the east coast of Africa, between
    latitude 4&#176; and 6&#176; south, and about ten days' journey in
    the interior, a semi-domestic dog, as the Rev. S. Erhardt informs
    me, is kept, which the natives assert is derived from a similar
    wild animal. Lichtenstein<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> says
    that the dogs of the Bosjemans present a striking resemblance even
    in colour (excepting the black stripe down the back) with the <I>C.
    mesomelas</I> of South Africa. Mr. E. Layard informs me that he has
    seen a Caffre dog which closely resembled an Esquimaux dog. In
    Australia the Dingo is both domesticated and wild; though this
    animal may have been introduced aboriginally by man, yet it must be
    considered as almost an endemic form, for its remains have been
    found in a similar state of preservation and associated with
    extinct mammals, so that its introduction must have been ancient.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From this resemblance of the half-domesticated
    dogs in several countries to the wild species still living
    there,&#8212;from the facility with which they can often be crossed
    together,&#8212;from even half-tamed animals being so much valued
    by savages,&#8212;and from the other circumstances previously
    remarked on which favour their domestication, it is highly probable
    that the domestic dogs of the world are descended from two
    well-defined species of wolf (viz. <I>C. lupus</I> and <I>C.
    latrans),</I> and from two or three other doubtful species (namely,
    the European, Indian, and North African wolves); from at least one
    or two South American canine species; from several races or species
    of jackal; and perhaps from one or more extinct species. Although
    it is possible or even probable that domesticated dogs, introduced
    into any country and bred there for many generations, might acquire
    some of the characters proper to the aboriginal Canid&#230; of the
    country, we can hardly thus account for introduced dogs having
    given rise to two breeds in the same country, resembling two of its
    aboriginal species, as in the above-given cases of Guiana and of
    North America.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It cannot be objected to the view of several
    canine species having been anciently domesticated, that these
    animals are tamed with difficulty: facts have been already given on
    this head, but I may add that the young of the <I>Canis
    prim&#230;vus</I> of India were tamed by Mr. Hodgson,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> and became as sensible of caresses, and
    manifested as much intelligence, as any sporting dog of the same
    age. There is not much difference, as we have already shown and
    shall further see, in habits between the domestic dogs of the North
    American Indians and the wolves of that country, or between the
    Eastern pariah dogs and jackals, or between the dogs which have run
    wild in various countries and the several natural species of the
    family. The habit of barking, however, which is almost universal
    with domesticated dogs, forms an exception, as it does not
    characterise a single natural species of the family, though I am
    assured that the <I>Canis latrans</I> of North America utters a
    noise which closely approaches a bark. But this habit is soon lost
    by dogs when they become feral and is soon reacquired when they are
    again domesticated. The case of the wild dogs on the island of Juan
    Fernandez having become dumb has often been quoted, and there is
    reason to believe<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> that the
    dumbness ensued in the course of thirty-three years; on the other
    hand, dogs taken from this island by Ulloa slowly reacquired the
    habit of barking. The Mackenzie-river dogs, of the <I>Canis
    latrans</I> type, when brought to England, never learned to bark
    properly; but one born in the Zoological Gardens<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> "made his voice sound as loudly as any
    other dog of the same age and size." According to Professor
    Nillson,<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> a wolf-whelp reared by a
    bitch barks. I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire exhibited a jackal which
    barked with the same tone as any common dog.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> An interesting account has been given by
    Mr. G. Clarke<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> of some dogs run
    wild on Juan de Nova, in the Indian Ocean; "they had entirely lost
    the faculty of barking; they had no inclination for the company of
    other dogs, nor did they acquire their voice" during a captivity of
    several months. On the island they "congregate in vast packs, and
    catch sea-birds with as much address as foxes could display." The
    feral dogs of La Plata have not become dumb; they are of large
    size, hunt singly or in packs, and burrow holes for their young.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> In these habits the feral dogs of
    La Plata resemble wolves and jackals; both of which hunt either
    singly or in packs, and burrow holes.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> These feral dogs have not become uniform
    in colour on Juan Fernandez, Juan de Nova, or La Plata.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> In Cuba the feral dogs are described by
    Poeppig as nearly all mouse-coloured, with short ears and
    light-blue eyes. In St. Domingo, Col. Ham. Smith says<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> that the feral dogs are very large, like
    greyhounds, of a uniform pale blue-ash, with small ears, and large
    light-brown eyes. Even the wild Dingo, though so anciently
    naturalised in Australia, "varies considerably in colour," as I am
    informed by Mr. P.P. King: a half-bred Dingo reared in England<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> showed signs of wishing to
    burrow.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From the several foregoing facts we see
    that reversion in the feral state gives no indication of the colour
    or size of the aboriginal parent-species. One fact, however, with
    respect to the colouring of domestic dogs, I at one time hoped
    might have thrown some light on their origin; and it is worth
    giving, as showing how colouring follows laws, even in so anciently
    and thoroughly domesticated an animal as the dog. Black dogs with
    tan-coloured feet, whatever breed they may belong to, almost
    invariably have a tan-coloured spot on the upper and inner corners
    of each eye, and their lips are generally thus coloured. I have
    seen only two exceptions to this rule, namely, in a spaniel and
    terrier. Dogs of a light-brown colour often have a lighter,
    yellowish-brown spot over the eyes; sometimes the spot is white,
    and in a mongrel terrier the spot was black. Mr. Waring kindly
    examined for me a stud of fifteen greyhounds in Suffolk: eleven of
    them were black, or black and white, or brindled, and these had no
    eye-spots; but three were red and one slaty-blue, and these four
    had dark-coloured spots over their eyes. Although the spots thus
    sometimes differ in colour, they strongly tend to be tan-coloured;
    this is proved by my having seen four spaniels, a setter, two
    Yorkshire shepherd dogs, a large mongrel, and some fox-hounds,
    coloured black and white, with not a trace of tan-colour, excepting
    the spots over the eyes, and sometimes a little on the feet. These
    latter cases, and many others, show plainly that the colour of the
    feet and the eye-spots are in some way correlated. I have noticed,
    in various breeds, every gradation, from the whole face being
    tan-coloured, to a complete ring round the eyes, to a minute spot
    over the inner and upper corners. The spots occur in various
    sub-breeds of terriers and spaniels; in setters; in hounds of
    various kinds, including the turnspit-like German badger-hound; in
    shepherd dogs; in a mongrel, of which neither parent had the spots;
    in one pure bulldog, though the spots were in this case almost
    white; and in greyhounds,&#8212;but true black-and-tan greyhounds
    are excessively rare; nevertheless I have been assured by Mr.
    Warwick, that one ran at the Caledonian Champion meeting of April
    1860, and was "marked precisely like a black-and-tan terrier." This
    dog, or another exactly the same colour, ran at the Scottish
    National Club on the 21st of March, 1865; and I hear from Mr. C. M.
    Browne, that "there was no reason either on the sire or dam side
    for the appearance of this unusual colour." Mr. Swinhoe at my
    request looked at the dogs in China, at Amoy, and he soon noticed a
    brown dog with yellow spots over the eyes. Colonel H. Smith<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> figures the magnificent black mastiff of
    Thibet with a tan-coloured stripe over the eyes, feet, and chaps;
    and what is more singular, he figures the Alco, or native domestic
    dog of Mexico, as black and white, with narrow tan-coloured rings
    round the eyes; at the Exhibition of dogs in London, May 1863, a
    so-called forest dog from North-West Mexico was shown, which had
    pale tan-coloured spots over the eyes. The occurrence of these
    tan-coloured spots in dogs of such extremely different breeds,
    living in various parts of the world, makes the fact highly
    remarkable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We shall hereafter see, especially in the
    chapter on Pigeons, that coloured marks are strongly inherited, and
    that they often aid us in discovering the primitive forms of our
    domestic races. Hence, if any wild canine species had distinctly
    exhibited the tan-coloured spots over the eyes, it might have been
    argued that this was the parent-form of nearly all our domestic
    races. But after looking at many coloured plates, and through the
    whole collection of skins in the British Museum, I can find no
    species thus marked. It is no doubt possible that some extinct
    species was thus coloured. On the other hand, in looking at the
    various species, there seems to be a tolerably plain correlation
    between tan-coloured legs and face; and less frequently between
    black legs and a black face; and this general rule of colouring
    explains to a certain extent the above-given cases of correlation
    between the eye-spots and the colour of the feet. Moreover, some
    jackals and foxes have a trace of a white ring round their eyes, as
    in <I>C. mesomelas, C. aureus,</I> and (judging from Colonel H.
    Smith's drawing) in <I>C. alopex,</I> and <I>C. thaleb.</I> Other
    species have a trace of a black line over the corners of the eyes,
    as in <I>C. variegatus, cinereo-variegatus,</I> and <I>fulvus,</I>
    and the wild Dingo. Hence I am inclined to conclude that a tendency
    for tan-coloured spots to appear over the eyes in the various
    breeds of dogs, is analogous to the case observed by Desmarest,
    namely, that when any white appears on a dog the tip of the tail is
    always white, "de mani&#232;re &#224; rappeler la tache terminale
    de m&#234;me couleur, qui caract&#233;rise la plupart des
    Canid&#233;s sauvages."<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> This
    rule, however, as I am assured by Mr. Jesse, does not invariably
    hold good.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has been objected that our domestic dogs
    cannot be descended from wolves or jackals, because their periods
    of gestation are different. The supposed difference rests on
    statements made by Buffon, Gilibert, Bechstein, and others; but
    these are now known to be erroneous; and the period is found to
    agree in the wolf, jackal, and dog, as closely as could be
    expected, for it is often in some degree variable.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> Tessier, who has closely attended to
    this subject, allows a difference of four days in the gestation of
    the dog. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me three carefully recorded
    cases of retrievers, in which the bitch was put only once to the
    dog; and not counting this day, but counting that of parturition,
    the periods were fifty-nine, sixty-two, and sixty-seven days. The
    average period is sixty-three days; but Bellingeri states that this
    applies only to large dogs; and that for small races it is from
    sixty to sixty-three days; Mr. Eyton of Eyton, who has had much
    experience with dogs, also informs me that the time is apt to be
    longer with large than with small dogs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">F. Cuvier has objected that the jackal would not
    have been domesticated on account of its offensive smell; but
    savages are not sensitive in this respect. The degree of odour,
    also, differs in the different kinds of jackal;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> and Colonel H. Smith makes a sectional
    division of the group with one character dependent on not being
    offensive. On the other hand, dogs&#8212; for instance, rough and
    smooth terriers&#8212;differ much in this respect; and M. Godron
    states that the hairless so-called Turkish dog is more odoriferous
    than other dogs. Isidore Geoffroy<A href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
    gave to a dog the same odour as that from a jackal by feeding it on
    raw flesh.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The belief that our dogs are descended from
    wolves, jackals, South American Canid&#230;, and other species,
    suggests a far more important difficulty. These animals in their
    undomesticated state, judging from a widely-spread analogy, would
    have been in some degree sterile if intercrossed; and such
    sterility will be admitted as almost certain by all those who
    believe that the lessened fertility of crossed forms is an
    infallible criterion of specific distinctness. Anyhow these animals
    keep distinct in the countries which they inhabit in common. On the
    other hand, all domestic dogs, which are here supposed to be
    descended from several distinct species, are, as far as is known,
    mutually fertile together. But, as Broca has well remarked,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> the fertility of successive generations
    of mongrel dogs has never been scrutinised with that care which is
    thought indispensable when species are crossed. The few facts
    leading to the conclusion that the sexual feelings and reproductive
    powers differ in the several races of the dog when crossed are
    (passing over mere size as rendering propagation difficult) as
    follows: the Mexican Alco<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
    apparently dislikes dogs of other kinds, but this perhaps is not
    strictly a sexual feeling; the hairless endemic dog of Paraguay,
    according to Rengger, mixes less with the European races than these
    do with each other; the Spitz dog in Germany is said to receive the
    fox more readily than do other breeds; and Dr. Hodgkin states that
    a female Dingo in England attracted the male wild foxes. If these
    latter statements can be trusted, they prove some degree of sexual
    difference in the breeds of the dog. But the fact remains that our
    domestic dogs, differing so widely as they do in external
    structure, are far more fertile together than we have reason to
    believe their supposed wild parents would have been. Pallas
    assumes<A href="#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> that a long course of
    domestication eliminates that sterility which the parent-species
    would have exhibited if only lately captured; no distinct facts are
    recorded in support of this hypothesis; but the evidence seems to
    me so strong (independently of the evidence derived from other
    domesticated animals) in favour of our domestic dogs having
    descended from several wild stocks, that I am inclined to admit the
    truth of this hypothesis.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is another and closely allied difficulty
    consequent on the doctrine of the descent of our domestic dogs from
    several wild species, namely, that they do not seem to be perfectly
    fertile with their supposed parents. But the experiment has not
    been quite fairly tried; the Hungarian dog, for instance, which in
    external appearance so closely resembles the European wolf, ought
    to be crossed with this wolf: and the pariah dogs of India with
    Indian wolves and jackals; and so in other cases. That the
    sterility is very slight between certain dogs and wolves and other
    Canid&#230; is shown by savages taking the trouble to cross them.
    Buffon got four successive generations from the wolf and dog, and
    the mongrels were perfectly fertile together.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> But more lately M. Flourens states
    positively as the result of his numerous experiments that hybrids
    from the wolf and dog, crossed <I>inter se,</I> become sterile at
    the third generation, and those from the jackal and dog at the
    fourth generation.<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> But these
    animals were closely confined; and many wild animals, as we shall
    see in a future chapter, are rendered by confinement in some degree
    or even utterly sterile. The Dingo, which breeds freely in
    Australia with our imported dogs, would not breed though repeatedly
    crossed in the Jardin des Plantes.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> Some hounds from Central Africa, brought
    home by Major Denham, never bred in the Town of London;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> and a similar tendency to sterility
    might be transmitted to the hybrid offspring of a wild animal.
    Moreover, it appears that in M. Flourens' experiments the hybrids
    were closely bred in and in for three or four generations; and this
    circumstance would most certainly increase the tendency to
    sterility. Several years ago I saw confined in the Zoological
    Gardens of London a female hybrid from an English dog and jackal,
    which even in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I
    was assured by her keeper, she did not fully exhibit her proper
    periods; but this case was certainly exceptional, as numerous
    instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals.
    In almost all experiments on the crossing of animals there are so
    many causes of doubt, that it is extremely difficult to come to any
    positive conclusion. It would, however, appear, that those who
    believe that our dogs are descended from several species will have
    not only to admit that their offspring after a long course of
    domestication generally lose all tendency to sterility when crossed
    together; but that between certain breeds of dogs and some of their
    supposed aboriginal parents a certain degree of sterility has been
    retained or possibly even acquired.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the difficulties in regard to
    fertility given in the last two paragraphs, when we reflect on the
    inherent improbability of man having domesticated throughout the
    world one single species alone of so widely distributed, so easily
    tamed, and so useful a group as the Canid&#230;; when we reflect on
    the extreme antiquity of the different breeds; and especially when
    we reflect on the close similarity, both in external structure and
    habits, between the domestic dogs of various countries and the wild
    species still inhabiting these same countries, the balance of
    evidence is strongly in favour of the multiple origin of our
    dogs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Differences between the several Breeds of the
    Dog.&#8212;</I>If the several breeds have descended from several
    wild stocks, their difference can obviously in part be explained by
    that of their parent species. For instance, the form of the
    greyhound may be partly accounted for by descent from some such
    animal as the slim Abyssinian <I>Canis simensis,</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> with its elongated muzzle; that of the
    larger dogs from the larger wolves, and the smaller and slighter
    dogs from the jackals: and thus perhaps we may account for certain
    constitutional and climatal differences. But it would be a great
    error to suppose that there has not been in addition<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> a large amount of variation. The
    intercrossing of the several aboriginal wild stocks, and of the
    subsequently formed races, has probably increased the total number
    of breeds, and, as we shall presently see, has greatly modified
    some of them. But we cannot explain by crossing the origin of such
    extreme forms as thoroughbred greyhounds, bloodhounds, bulldogs,
    Blenheim spaniels, terriers, pugs, etc., unless we believe that
    forms equally or more strongly characterised in these different
    respects once existed in nature. But hardly any one has been bold
    enough to suppose that such unnatural forms ever did or could exist
    in a wild state. When compared with all known members of the family
    of Canid&#230; they betray a distinct and abnormal origin. No
    instance is on record of such dogs as bloodhounds, spaniels, true
    greyhounds having been kept by savages: they are the product of
    long-continued civilisation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The number of breeds and sub-breeds of
    the dog is great; Youatt for instance, describes twelve kinds of
    greyhounds. I will not attempt to enumerate or describe the
    varieties, for we cannot discriminate how much of their difference
    is due to variation, and how much to descent from different
    aboriginal stocks. But it may be worth while briefly to mention
    some points. Commencing with the skull, Cuvier has admitted<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> that in form the differences are "plus
    fortes que celles d'aucunes esp&#232;ces sauvages d'un m&#234;me
    genre naturel." The proportions of the different bones; the
    curvature of the lower jaw, the position of the condyles with
    respect to the plane of the teeth (on which F. Cuvier founded his
    classification), and in mastiffs the shape of its posterior branch;
    the shape of the zygomatic arch, and of the temporal fossae; the
    position of the occiput&#8212;all vary considerably.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> The difference in size between the
    brains of dogs belonging to large and small breeds "is something
    prodigious." "Some dogs' brains are high and rounded, while others
    are low, long, and narrow in front." In the latter, "the olfactory
    lobes are visible for about half their extent, when the brain is
    seen from above, but they are wholly concealed by the hemispheres
    in other breeds."<A href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> The dog has
    properly six pairs of molar teeth in the upper jaw, and seven in
    the lower; but several naturalists have seen not rarely an
    additional pair in the upper jaw;<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
    and Professor Gervais says that there are dogs "qui ont sept paires
    de dents sup&#233;rieures et huit inf&#233;rieures." De
    Blainville<A href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> has given full
    particulars on the frequency of these deviations in the number of
    the teeth, and has shown that it is not always the same tooth which
    is supernumerary. In short-muzzled races, according to H.
    M&#252;ller,<A href="#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> the molar teeth
    stand obliquely, whilst in long-muzzled races they are placed
    longitudinally, with open spaces between them. The naked, so-called
    Egyptian or Turkish dog is extremely deficient in its teeth,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> &#8212;sometimes having none except
    one molar on each side; but this, though characteristic of the
    breed, must be considered as a monstrosity. M. Girard,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> who seems to have attended closely to
    the subject, says that the period of the appearance of the
    permanent teeth differs in different dogs, being earlier in large
    dogs; thus the mastiff assumes its adult teeth in four or five
    months, whilst in the spaniel the period is sometimes more than
    seven or eight months. On the other hand small dogs are mature, and
    the females have arrived at the best age for breeding, when one
    year old, whereas large dogs "are still in their puppyhood at this
    time, and take fully twice as long to develop their proportions."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to minor differences little
    need be said. Isidore Geoffroy has shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> that in size some dogs are six times as
    long (the tail being excluded) as others; and that the height
    relatively to the length of the body varies from between one to
    two, and one to nearly four. In the Scotch deer-hound there is a
    striking and remarkable difference in the size of the male and
    female.<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> Every one knows how the
    ears vary in size in different breeds, and with their great
    development their muscles become atrophied. Certain breeds of dogs
    are described as having a deep furrow between the nostrils and
    lips. The caudal vertebrae, according to F. Cuvier, on whose
    authority the two last statements rest, vary in number; and the
    tail in English cattle and some shepherd dogs is almost absent. The
    mammae vary from seven to ten in number; Daubenton, having examined
    twenty-one dogs, found eight with five mammae on each side; eight
    with four on each side; and the others with an unequal number on
    the two sides.<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> Dogs have properly
    five toes in front and four behind, but a fifth toe is often added;
    and F. Cuvier states that, when a fifth toe is present, a fourth
    cuneiform bone is developed; and, in this case, sometimes the great
    cuneiform bone is raised, and gives on its inner side a large
    articular surface to the astragalus; so that even the relative
    connection of the bones, the most constant of all characters,
    varies. These modifications, however, in the feet of dogs are not
    important, because they ought to be ranked, as De Blainville has
    shown<A href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> as monstrosities.
    Nevertheless they are interesting from being correlated with the
    size of the body, for they occur much more frequently with mastiffs
    and other large breeds than with small dogs. Closely allied
    varieties, however, sometimes differ in this respect; thus Mr.
    Hodgson states that the black-and-tan Lassa variety of the Thibet
    mastiff has the fifth digit, whilst the Mustang sub-variety is not
    thus characterised. The extent to which the skin is developed
    between the toes varies much; but we shall return to this point.
    The degree to which the various breeds differ in the perfection of
    their senses, dispositions, and inherited habits is notorious to
    every one. The breeds present some constitutional differences: the
    pulse, says Youatt<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> "varies
    materially according to the breed, as well as to the size of the
    animal." Different breeds of dogs are subject in different degrees
    to various diseases. They certainly become adapted to different
    climates under which they have long existed. It is notorious that
    most of our best European breeds deteriorate in India.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> The Rev R. Everest<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> believes that no one has succeeded in
    keeping the Newfoundland dog long alive in India; so it is,
    according to Lichtenstein,<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> even
    at the Cape of Good Hope. The Thibet mastiff degenerates on the
    plains of India, and can live only on the mountains.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> Lloyd<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A>
    asserts that our bloodhounds and bulldogs have been tried, and
    cannot withstand the cold of the northern European
    forests.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Seeing in how many characters the races of the
    dog differ from each other, and remembering Cuvier's admission that
    their skulls differ more than do those of the species of any
    natural genus, and bearing in mind how closely the bones of wolves,
    jackals, foxes, and other Canid&#230; agree, it is remarkable that
    we meet with the statement, repeated over and over again, that the
    races of the dog differ in no important characters. A highly
    competent judge, Prof. Gervais,<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A>
    admits "si l'on prenait sans contr&#244;le les alterations dont
    chacun de ces organes est susceptible, on pourrait croire qu'il y a
    entre les chiens domestiques des diff&#233;rences plus grandes que
    celles qui s&#233;parent ailleurs les esp&#232;ces, quelquefois
    m&#234;me les genres." Some of the differences above enumerated are
    in one respect of comparatively little value, for they are not
    characteristic of distinct breeds: no one pretends that such is the
    case with the additional molar teeth or with the number of mammae;
    the additional digit is generally present with mastiffs, and some
    of the more important differences in the skull and lower jaw are
    more or less characteristic of various breeds. But we must not
    forget that the predominant power of selection has not been applied
    in any of these cases; we have variability in important parts, but
    the differences have not been fixed by selection. Man cares for the
    form and fleetness of his greyhounds, for the size of his mastiffs,
    and formerly for the strength of the jaw in his bulldogs, etc.; but
    he cares nothing about the number of their molar teeth or mammae or
    digits; nor do we know that differences in these organs are
    correlated with, or owe their development to, differences in other
    parts of the body about which man does care. Those who have
    attended to the subject of selection will admit that, nature having
    given variability, man, if he so chose, could fix five toes to the
    hinder feet of certain breeds of dogs, as certainly as to the feet
    of his Dorking fowls: he could probably fix, but with much more
    difficulty, an additional pair of molar teeth in either jaw, in the
    same way as he has given additional horns to certain breeds of
    sheep; if he wished to produce a toothless breed of dogs, having
    the so-called Turkish dog with its imperfect teeth to work on, he
    could probably do so, for he has succeeded in making hornless
    breeds of cattle and sheep.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the precise causes and steps by
    which the several races of dogs have come to differ so greatly from
    each other, we are, as in most other cases, profoundly ignorant. We
    may attribute part of the difference in external form and
    constitution to inheritance from distinct wild stocks, that is to
    changes effected under nature before domestication. We must
    attribute something to the crossing of the several domestic and
    natural races. I shall, however, soon recur to the crossing of
    races. We have already seen how often savages cross their dogs with
    wild native species; and Pennant gives a curious account<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> of the manner in which Fochabers, in
    Scotland, was stocked "with a multitude of curs of a most wolfish
    aspect" from a single hybrid-wolf brought into that district.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It would appear that climate to a certain extent
    directly modifies the forms of dogs. We have lately seen that
    several of our English breeds cannot live in India, and it is
    positively asserted that when bred there for a few generations they
    degenerate not only in their mental faculties, but in form. Captain
    Williamson,<A href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> who carefully
    attended to this subject, states that "hounds are the most rapid in
    their decline;" "greyhounds and pointers, also, rapidly decline."
    But spaniels, after eight or nine generations, and without a cross
    from Europe, are as good as their ancestors. Dr. Falconer informs
    me that bulldogs, which have been known, when first brought into
    the country, to pin down even an elephant by its trunk, not only
    fall off after two or three generations in pluck and ferocity, but
    lose the under-hung character of their lower jaws; their muzzles
    become finer and their bodies lighter. English dogs imported into
    India are so valuable that probably due care has been taken to
    prevent their crossing with native dogs; so that the deterioration
    cannot be thus accounted for. The Rev. R. Everest informs me that
    he obtained a pair of setters, born in India, which perfectly
    resembled their Scotch parents: he raised several litters from them
    in Delhi, taking the most stringent precautions to prevent a cross,
    but he never succeeded, though this was only the second generation
    in India, in obtaining a single young dog like its parents in size
    or make; their nostrils were more contracted, their noses more
    pointed, their size inferior, and their limbs more slender. So
    again on the coast of Guinea, dogs, according to Bosman, "alter
    strangely; their ears grow long and stiff like those of foxes, to
    which colour they also incline, so that in three or four years,
    they degenerate into very ugly creatures; and in three or four
    broods their barking turns into a howl."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> This remarkable tendency to rapid
    deterioration in European dogs subjected to the climate of India
    and Africa, may be largely accounted for by reversion to a
    primordial condition which many animals exhibit, as we shall
    hereafter see, when their constitutions are in any way
    disturbed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some of the peculiarities characteristic of the
    several breeds of the dog have probably arisen suddenly, and,
    though strictly inherited, may be called monstrosities; for
    instance, the shape of the legs and body in the turnspit of Europe
    and India; the shape of the head and the under-hanging jaw in the
    bull-and pug-dog, so alike in this one respect and so unlike in all
    others. A peculiarity suddenly arising, and therefore in one sense
    deserving to be called a monstrosity, may, however, be increased
    and fixed by man's selection. We can hardly doubt that
    long-continued training, as with the greyhound in coursing hares,
    as with water-dogs in swimming&#8212;and the want of exercise, in
    the case of lapdogs&#8212;must have produced some direct effect on
    their structure and instincts. But we shall immediately see that
    the most potent cause of change has probably been the selection,
    both methodical and unconscious, of slight individual
    differences,&#8212;the latter kind of selection resulting from the
    occasional preservation, during hundreds of generations, of those
    individual dogs which were the most useful to man for certain
    purposes and under certain conditions of life. In a future chapter
    on Selection I shall show that even barbarians attend closely to
    the qualities of their dogs. This unconscious selection by man
    would be aided by a kind of natural selection; for the dogs of
    savages have partly to gain their own subsistence: for instance, in
    Australia, as we hear from Mr. Nind,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> the dogs are sometimes compelled by want
    to leave their masters and provide for themselves; but in a few
    days they generally return. And we may infer that dogs of different
    shapes, sizes, and habits, would have the best chance of surviving
    under different circumstances,&#8212;on open sterile plains, where
    they have to run down their own prey,&#8212;on rocky coasts, where
    they have to feed on crabs and fish left in the tidal pools, as in
    the case of New Guinea and Tierra del Fuego. In this latter
    country, as I am informed by Mr. Bridges, the Catechist to the
    Mission, the dogs turn over the stones on the shore to catch the
    crustaceans which lie beneath, and they "are clever enough to knock
    off the shell-fish at a first blow;" for if this be not done,
    shell-fish are well-known to have an almost invincible power of
    adhesion.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has already been remarked that dogs differ in
    the degree to which their feet are webbed. In dogs of the
    Newfoundland breed, which are eminently aquatic in their habits,
    the skin, according to Isidore Geoffroy, extends to the third
    phalanges whilst in ordinary dogs it extends only to the second. In
    two Newfoundland dogs which I examined, when the toes were
    stretched apart and viewed on the under side, the skin extended in
    a nearly straight line between the outer margins of the balls of
    the toes; whereas, in two terriers of distinct sub-breeds, the skin
    viewed in the same manner was deeply scooped out. In Canada there
    is a dog which is peculiar to the country and common there, and
    this has "half-webbed feet and is fond of the water."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> English otter-hounds are said to have
    webbed feet: a friend examined for me the feet of two, in
    comparison with the feet of some harriers and bloodhounds; he found
    the skin variable in extent in all, but more developed in the
    otter-hounds than in the others.<A href="#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A>
    As aquatic animals which belong to quite different orders have
    webbed feet, there can be no doubt that this structure would be
    serviceable to dogs that frequent the water. We may confidently
    infer that no man ever selected his water-dogs by the extent to
    which the skin was developed between their toes; but what he does,
    is to preserve and breed from those individuals which hunt best in
    the water, or best retrieve wounded game, and thus he unconsciously
    selects dogs with feet slightly better webbed. The effects of use
    from the frequent stretching apart of the toes will likewise aid in
    the result. Man thus closely imitates Natural Selection. We have an
    excellent illustration of this same process in North America,
    where, according to Sir J. Richardson,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> all the wolves, foxes, and aboriginal
    domestic dogs have their feet broader than in the corresponding
    species of the Old World, and "well calculated for running on the
    snow." Now, in these Arctic regions, the life or death of every
    animal will often depend on its success in hunting over the snow
    when soft; and this will in part depend on the feet being broad;
    yet they must not be so broad as to interfere with the activity of
    the animal when the ground is sticky, or with its power of
    burrowing holes, or with other necessary habits of life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As changes in domestic breeds which take place
    so slowly are not to be noticed at any one period, whether due to
    the selection of individual variations or of differences resulting
    from crosses, are most important in understanding the origin of our
    domestic productions, and likewise in throwing indirect light on
    the changes effected under nature, I will give in detail such cases
    as I have been able to collect. Lawrence,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> who paid particular attention to the
    history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says that between eighty
    and ninety years before "an entirely new foxhound was raised
    through the breeder's art," the ears of the old southern hound
    being reduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in
    length, and the stature somewhat added to. It is believed that this
    was effected by a cross with a greyhound. With respect to this
    latter dog, Youatt,<A href="#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> who is
    generally cautious in his statements, says that the greyhound
    within the last fifty years, that is before the commencement of the
    present century, "assumed a somewhat different character from that
    which he once possessed. He is now distinguished by a beautiful
    symmetry of form, of which he could not once boast, and he has even
    superior speed to that which he formerly exhibited. He is no longer
    used to struggle with deer, but contends with his fellows over a
    shorter and speedier course." An able writer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> believes that our English greyhounds are
    the descendants, <I>progressively improved,</I> of the large rough
    greyhounds which existed in Scotland so early as the third century.
    A cross at some former period with the Italian greyhound has been
    suspected; but this seems hardly probable, considering the
    feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as is well-known,
    crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with a
    bulldog&#8212;this breed being chosen from being erroneously
    supposed to be deficient in the power of scent; "after the sixth or
    seventh generation," says Youatt, "there was not a vestige left of
    the form of the bulldog, but his courage and indomitable
    perseverance remained."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Youatt infers, from a comparison of an old
    picture of King Charles's spaniels with the living dog, that "the
    breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse:" the
    muzzle has become shorter, the forehead more prominent, and the
    eyes larger; the changes in this case have probably been due to
    simple selection. The setter, as this author remarks in another
    place, "is evidently the large spaniel improved to his present
    peculiar size and beauty, and taught another way of marking his
    game. If the form of the dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on
    this point, we might have recourse to history:" he then refers to a
    document dated 1685 bearing on this subject, and adds that the pure
    Irish setter shows no signs of a cross with the pointer, which some
    authors suspect has been the case with the English setter. The
    bulldog is an English breed, and as I hear from Mr. G. R. Jesse,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> seems to have originated from the
    mastiff since the time of Shakspeare; but certainly existed in
    1631, as shown by Prestwick Eaton's letters. There can be no doubt
    that the fancy bulldogs of the present day, now that they are not
    used for bull-baiting, have become greatly reduced in size, without
    any express intention on the part of the breeder. Our pointers are
    certainly descended from a Spanish breed, as even their present
    names, Don, Ponto, Carlos, etc., show; it is said that they were
    not known in England before the Revolution in 1688;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> but the breed since its introduction has
    been much modified, for Mr. Borrow, who is a sportsman and knows
    Spain intimately well, informs me that he has not seen in that
    country any breed "corresponding in figure with the English
    pointer; but there are genuine pointers near Xeres which have been
    imported by English gentlemen." A nearly parallel case is offered
    by the Newfoundland dog, which was certainly brought into England
    from that country, but which has since been so much modified that,
    as several writers have observed, it does not now closely resemble
    any existing native dog in Newfoundland.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These several cases of slow and gradual changes
    in our English dogs possess some interest; for though the changes
    have generally, but not invariably, been caused by one or two
    crosses with a distinct breed, yet we may feel sure, from the
    well-known extreme variability of crossed breeds, that rigorous and
    long-continued selection must have been practised, in order to
    improve them in a definite manner. As soon as any strain or family
    became slightly improved or better adapted to alter circumstances,
    it would tend to supplant the older and less improved strains. For
    instance, as soon as the old foxhound was improved by a cross with
    the greyhound, or by simple selection, and assumed its present
    character&#8212;and the change was probably desired owing to the
    increased fleetness of our hunters&#8212;it rapidly spread
    throughout the country, and is now everywhere nearly uniform. But
    the process of improvement is still going on for every one tries to
    improve his strain by occasionally procuring dogs from the best
    kennels. Through this process of gradual substitution the old
    English hound has been lost; and so it has been with the Irish
    wolf-dog, the old English bulldog, and several other breeds, such
    as the alaunt, as I am informed by Mr. Jesse. But the extinction of
    former breeds is apparently aided by another cause; for whenever a
    breed is kept in scanty numbers, as at present with the bloodhound,
    it is reared with some difficulty, apparently from the evil effects
    of long-continued close interbreeding. As several breeds of the dog
    have been slightly but sensibly modified within so short a period
    as the last one or two centuries, by the selection of the best
    individuals, modified in many cases by crosses with other breeds;
    and as we shall hereafter see that the breeding of dogs was
    attended to in ancient times, as it still is by savages, we may
    conclude that we have in selection, even if only occasionally
    practised, a potent means of modification.</P>

      <H3>DOMESTIC CATS.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Cats have been domesticated in the East from an
    ancient period; Mr. Blyth informs me that they are mentioned in a
    Sanskrit writing 2000 years old, and in Egypt their antiquity is
    known to be even greater, as shown by monumental drawings and their
    mummied bodies. These mummies, according to De Blainville,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A> who has particularly studied the
    subject, belong to no less than three species, namely, <I>F.
    caligulata,</I> bubastes, and <I>chaus.</I> The two former species
    are said to be still found, both wild and domesticated, in parts of
    Egypt. <I>F. caligulata</I> presents a difference in the first
    inferior milk molar tooth, as compared with the domestic cats of
    Europe, which makes De Blainville conclude that it is not one of
    the parent-forms of our cats. Several naturalists, as Pallas,
    Temminck, Blyth, believe that domestic cats are the descendants of
    several species commingled: it is certain that cats cross readily
    with various wild species, and it would appear that the character
    of the domestic breeds has, at least in some cases, been thus
    affected. Sir W. Jardine has no doubt that, "in the north of
    Scotland, there has been occasional crossing with our native
    species (<I>F. sylvestris</I>), and that the result of these
    crosses has been kept in our houses. I have seen," he adds, "many
    cats very closely resembling the wild cat, and one or two that
    could scarcely be distinguished from it." Mr. Blyth<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> remarks on this passage, "but such cats
    are never seen in the southern parts of England; still, as compared
    with any Indian tame cat, the affinity of the ordinary British cat
    to <I>F. sylvestris</I> is manifest; and due I suspect to frequent
    intermixture at a time when the tame cat was first introduced into
    Britain and continued rare, while the wild species was far more
    abundant than at present." In Hungary, Jeitteles<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>90</SUP></A> was assured on trustworthy authority
    that a wild male cat crossed with a female domestic cat, and that
    the hybrids long lived in a domesticated state. In Algiers the
    domestic cat has crossed with the wild cat (<I>F. lybica</I>) of
    that country.<A href="#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> In South Africa as
    Mr. E. Layard informs me, the domestic cat intermingles freely with
    the wild <I>F. caffra</I>; he has seen a pair of hybrids which were
    quite tame and particularly attached to the lady who brought them
    up; and Mr. Fry has found that these hybrids are fertile. In India
    the domestic cat, according to Mr. Blyth, has crossed with four
    Indian species. With respect to one of these species, <I>F.
    chaus,</I> an excellent observer, Sir W. Elliot, informs me that he
    once killed, near Madras, a wild brood, which were evidently
    hybrids from the domestic cat; these young animals had a thick
    lynx-like tail and the broad brown bar on the inside of the forearm
    characteristic of <I>F. chaus.</I> Sir W. Elliot adds that he has
    often observed this same mark on the forearms of domestic cats in
    India. Mr. Blyth states that domestic cats coloured nearly like <I>
    F. chaus,</I> but not resembling that species in shape, abound in
    Bengal; he adds, "such a colouration is utterly unknown in European
    cats, and the proper tabby markings (pale streaks on a black
    ground, peculiarly and symmetrically disposed), so common in
    English cats, are never seen in those of India." Dr. D. Short has
    assured Mr. Blyth<A href="#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> that, at Hansi,
    hybrids between the common cat and <I>F. ornata</I> (or <I>
    torquata</I>) occur, "and that many of the domestic cats of that
    part of India were undistinguishable from the wild <I>F.
    ornata.</I>" Azara states, but only on the authority of the
    inhabitants, that in Paraguay the cat has crossed with two native
    species. From these several cases we see that in Europe, Asia,
    Africa, and America, the common cat, which lives a freer life than
    most other domesticated animals, has crossed with various wild
    species; and that in some instances the crossing has been
    sufficiently frequent to affect the character of the breed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whether domestic cats have descended from
    several distinct species, or have only been modified by occasional
    crosses, their fertility, as far as is known, is unimpaired. The
    large Angora or Persian cat is the most distinct in structure and
    habits of all the domestic breeds; and is believed by Pallas, but
    on no distinct evidence, to be descended from the <I>F. manul</I>
    of middle Asia; and I am assured by Mr. Blyth that the Angora cat
    breeds freely with Indian cats, which, as we have already seen,
    have apparently been much crossed with <I>F. chaus.</I> In England
    half-bred Angora cats are perfectly fertile with one another.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Within the same country we do not meet with
    distinct races of the cat, as we do of dogs and of most other
    domestic animals; though the cats of the same country present a
    considerable amount of fluctuating variability. The explanation
    obviously is that, from their nocturnal and rambling habits,
    indiscriminate crossing cannot without much trouble be prevented.
    Selection cannot be brought into play to produce distinct breeds,
    or to keep those distinct which have been imported from foreign
    lands. On the other hand, in islands and in countries completely
    separated from each other, we meet with breeds more or less
    distinct; and these cases are worth giving, showing that the
    scarcity of distinct races in the same country is not caused by a
    deficiency of variability in the animal. The tailless cats of the
    Isle of Man are said to differ from common cats not only in the
    want of a tail, but in the greater length of their hind legs, in
    the size of their heads, and in habits. The Creole cat of Antigua,
    as I am informed by Mr. Nicholson, is smaller, and has a more
    elongated head, than the British cat. In Ceylon, as Mr. Thwaites
    writes to me, every one at first notices the different appearance
    of the native cat from the English animal; it is of small size,
    with closely lying hairs; its head is small, with a receding
    forehead; but the ears are large and sharp; altogether it has what
    is there called a "low-caste" appearance. Rengger<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A> says that the domestic cat, which has
    been bred for 300 years in Paraguay, presents a striking difference
    from the European cat; it is smaller by a fourth, has a more lanky
    body, its hair is short, shining, scanty and lies close, especially
    on the tail: he adds that the change has been less at Ascension,
    the capital of Paraguay, owing to the continual crossing with newly
    imported cats; and this fact well illustrates the importance of
    separation. The conditions of life in Paraguay appear not to be
    highly favourable to the cat, for, though they have run half-wild,
    they do not become thoroughly feral, like so many other European
    animals. In another part of South America, according to Roulin,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>94</SUP></A> the introduced cat has lost the
    habit of uttering its hideous nocturnal howl. The Rev. W.D. Fox
    purchased a cat in Portsmouth, which he was told came from the
    coast of Guinea; its skin was black and wrinkled, fur bluish-grey
    and short, its ears rather bare, legs long, and whole aspect
    peculiar. This "negro" cat was fertile with common cats. On the
    opposite coast of Africa, at Mombas, Captain Owen, <SMALL>
    R.N.</SMALL>,<A href="#refer"><SUP>95</SUP></A> states that all the
    cats are covered with short stiff hair instead of fur: he gives a
    curious account of a cat from Algoa Bay, which had been kept for
    some time on board and could be identified with certainty; this
    animal was left for only eight weeks at Mombas, but during that
    short period it "underwent a complete metamorphosis, having parted
    with its sandy-coloured fur." A cat from the Cape of Good Hope has
    been described by Desmarest as remarkable from a red stripe
    extending along the whole length of its back. Throughout an immense
    area, namely, the Malayan archipelago, Siam, Pegu, and Burmah, all
    the cats have truncated tails about half the proper length, often
    with a sort of knot at the end. In the Caroline archipelago the
    cats have very long legs, and are of a reddish-yellow colour.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>97</SUP></A> In China a breed has drooping ears.
    At Tobolsk, according to Gmelin, there is a red-coloured breed. In
    Asia, also, we find the well-known Angora or Persian breed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The domestic cat has run wild in several
    countries, and everywhere assumes, as far as can be judged by the
    short recorded descriptions, a uniform character. Near Maldonado,
    in La Plata, I shot one which seemed perfectly wild; it was
    carefully examined by Mr. Waterhouse, who found nothing remarkable
    in it, excepting its great size. In New Zealand according to
    Dieffenbach, the feral cats assume a streaky grey colour like that
    of wild cats; and this is the case with the half-wild cats of the
    Scotch Highlands.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have seen that distant countries possess
    distinct domestic races of the cat. The differences may be in part
    due to descent from several aboriginal species, or at least to
    crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay, Mombas, and
    Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of different
    conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may possibly
    be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have
    largely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But
    man, owing to the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by
    methodical selection; and probably very little by unintentional
    selection; though in each litter he generally saves the prettiest,
    and values most a good breed of mouse- or rat-catchers. Those cats
    which have a strong tendency to prowl after game, generally get
    destroyed by traps. As cats are so much petted, a breed bearing the
    same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear to larger dogs,
    would have been much valued; and if selection could have been
    applied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each
    long-civilised country, for there is plenty of variability to work
    upon.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We see in this country considerable diversity in
    size, some in the proportions of the body, and extreme variability
    in colouring. I have only lately attended to this subject, but have
    already heard of some singular cases of variation; one of a cat
    born in the West Indies toothless, and remaining so all its life.
    Mr. Tegetmeier has shown me the skull of a female cat with its
    canines so much developed that they protruded uncovered beyond the
    lips; the tooth with the fang being .95, and the part projecting
    from the gum .6 of an inch in length. I have heard of several
    families of six-toed cats, in one of which the peculiarity had been
    transmitted for at least three generations. The tail varies greatly
    in length; I have seen a cat which always carried its tail flat on
    its back when pleased. The ears vary in shape, and certain strains,
    in England, inherit a pencil-like tuft of hairs, above a quarter of
    an inch in length, on the tips of their ears; and this same
    peculiarity, according to Mr. Blyth, characterises some cats in
    India. The great variability in the length of the tail and the
    lynx-like tufts of hairs on the ears are apparently analogous to
    differences in certain wild species of the genus. A much more
    important difference, according to Daubenton,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>99</SUP></A> is that the intestines of domestic cats
    are wider, and a third longer, than in wild cats of the same size;
    and this apparently has been by their less strictly carnivorous
    diet.</P>

      in the United States. Prof. Low, in his 'Domesticated Animals,'
      1845, p. 666, comes to this same conclusion. No one has argued on
      this side with more clearness and force than the late James

      Agricultural and Wernerian Societies. Isidore Geoffroy

      to the view that all the domestic races are the modified
      descendants of a single species, after a long discussion, says,

      sixteen days ('Phil. Transact.,' 1787, p. 353). Hunter found that
      the gestation of a mongrel from wolf and dog ('Phil. Transact.,'

      the dog more than once. The period of a mongrel dog and jackal
      was fifty-nine days. Fred. Cuvier found the period of gestation
      of the wolf to be ('Dict. Class. d'Hist. Nat.' tom. iv. p. 8) two
      months and a few days, which agrees with the dog. Isid G.

      "strongly subject" to polypi in the matrix or vagina. The spaniel
      and pug (p. 182) are most liable to bronchocele. The liability to
      distemper (p. 232) is extremely different in different breeds. On
      the distemper, <I>see also</I> Col. Hutchinson on 'Dog Breaking,'
