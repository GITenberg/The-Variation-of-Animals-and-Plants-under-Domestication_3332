    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have been led to study domestic pigeons with
    particular care, because the evidence that all the domestic races
    are descended from one known source is far clearer than with any
    other anciently domesticated animal. Secondly, because many
    treatises in several languages, some of them old, have been written
    on the pigeon, so that we are enabled to trace the history of
    several breeds. And lastly, because, from causes which we can
    partly understand, the amount of variation has been extraordinarily
    great. The details will often be tediously minute; but no one who
    really wants to understand the progress of change in domestic
    animals, and especially no one who has kept pigeons and has marked
    the great difference between the breeds and the trueness with which
    most of them propagate their kind, will doubt that this minuteness
    is worth while. Notwithstanding the clear evidence that all the
    breeds are the descendants of a single species, I could not
    persuade myself until some years had passed that the whole amount
    of difference between them, had arisen since man first domesticated
    the wild rock-pigeon.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have kept alive all the most distinct breeds,
    which I could procure in England or from the Continent; and have
    prepared skeletons of all. I have received skins from Persia, and a
    large number from India and other quarters of the world.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Since my admission into two of the London
    pigeon-clubs, I have received the kindest assistance from many of
    the most eminent amateurs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The races of the Pigeon which can be
    distinguished, and which breed true, are very numerous. MM. Boitard
    and Corbi&#233;<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> describe in detail
    122 kinds; and I could add several European kinds not known to
    them. In India, judging from the skins sent me, there are many
    breeds unknown here; and Sir W. Elliot informs me that a collection
    imported by an Indian merchant into Madras from Cairo and
    Constantinople included several kinds unknown in India. I have no
    doubt that there exist considerably above 150 kinds which breed
    true and have been separately named. But of these the far greater
    number differ from each other only in unimportant characters. Such
    differences will be here entirely passed over, and I shall confine
    myself to the more important points of structure. That many
    important differences exist we shall presently see. I have looked
    through the magnificent collection of the Columbid&#230; in the
    British Museum, and, with the exception of a few forms (such as the
    Didunculus, Cal&#230;nas, Goura, etc.), I do not hesitate to affirm
    that some domestic races of the rock-pigeon differ fully as much
    from each other in external characters as do the most distinct
    natural genera. We may look in vain through the 288 known species<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> for a beak so small and conical as
    that of the short-faced tumbler; for one so broad and short as that
    of the barb; for one so long, straight, and narrow, with its
    enormous wattles, as that of the English carrier; for an expanded
    upraised tail like that of the fantail; or for an &#156;sophagus
    like that of the pouter. I do not for a moment pretend that the
    domestic races differ from each other in their whole organisation
    as much as the more distinct natural genera. I refer only to
    external characters, on which, however, it must be confessed that
    most genera of birds have been founded. When, in a future chapter,
    we discuss the principle of selection as followed by man, we shall
    clearly see why the differences between the domestic races are
    almost always confined to external, or at least to externally
    visible, characters.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Owing to the amount and gradations of difference
    between the several breeds, I have found it indispensable in the
    following classification to rank them under Groups, Races, and
    Sub-races; to which varieties and sub-varieties, all strictly
    inheriting their proper characters, must often be added. Even with
    the individuals of the same sub-variety, when long kept by
    different fanciers, different strains can sometimes be recognised.
    There can be no doubt that, if well-characterised forms of the
    several races had been found wild, all would have been ranked as
    distinct species, and several of them would certainly have been
    placed by ornithologists in distinct genera. A good classification
    of the various domestic breeds is extremely difficult, owing to the
    manner in which many of the forms graduate into each other; but it
    is curious how exactly the same difficulties are encountered, and
    the same rules have to be followed, as in the classification of any
    natural but difficult group of organic beings. An "artificial
    classification" might be followed which would present fewer
    difficulties than a "natural classification;" but then it would
    interrupt many plain affinities. Extreme forms can readily be
    defined; but intermediate and troublesome forms often destroy our
    definitions. Forms which may be called "aberrant" must sometimes be
    included within groups to which they do not accurately belong.
    Characters of all kinds must be used; but as with birds in a state
    of nature, those afforded by the beak are the best and most readily
    appreciated. It is not possible to weigh the importance of all the
    characters which have to be used so as to make the groups and
    sub-groups of equal value. Lastly, a group may contain only one
    race, and another and less distinctly defined group may contain
    several races and sub-races, and in this case it is difficult, as
    in the classification of natural species, to avoid placing too high
    a value on the number of forms which a group may contain.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In my measurements I have never trusted to the
    eye; and when speaking of a part being large or small, I always
    refer to the wild rock-pigeon (<I>Columba livia</I>) as the
    standard of comparison. The measurements are given in decimals of
    an inch.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A></P>

    Columba livia</I> (including under this name two or three

      <H4>GROUP I.</H4>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This group includes a single race, that of the
    Pouters. If the most strongly marked sub-race be taken, namely, the
    Improved English Pouter, this is perhaps the most distinct of all
    domesticated pigeons.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <B>Race I. Pouter Pigeons.</B><BR>
      (Kropftauben, German. Grosses-gorges, or Boulans, French.)
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>&#338;sophagus of great size, barely
    separated from the crop, often inflated. Body and legs elongated.
    Beak of moderate dimensions.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race I.</I>&#8212;The improved
    English Pouter, when its crop is fully inflated, presents a truly
    astonishing appearance. The habit of slightly inflating the crop is
    common to all domestic pigeons, but is carried to an extreme in the
    Pouter. The crop does not differ, except in size, from that of
    other pigeons; but is less plainly separated by an oblique
    constriction from the &#156;sophagus. The diameter of the upper
    part of the &#156;sophagus is immense, even close up to the head.
    The beak in one bird which I possessed was almost completely buried
    when the &#156;sophagus was fully expanded. The males, especially
    when excited, pout more than the females, and they glory in
    exercising this power. If a bird will not, to use the technical
    expression, "play," the fancier, as I have witnessed, by taking the
    beak into his mouth, blows him up like a balloon; and the bird,
    then puffed up with wind and pride, struts about, retaining his
    magnificent size as long as he can. Pouters often take flight with
    their crops inflated. After one of my birds had swallowed a good
    meal of peas and water, as he flew up in order to disgorge them and
    feed his nearly fledged young, I heard the peas rattling in his
    inflated crop as if in a bladder. When flying, they often strike
    the backs of their wings together, and thus make a clapping
    noise.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Pouters stand remarkably upright, and
    their bodies are thin and elongated. In connexion with this form of
    body, the ribs are generally broader and the vertebr&#230; more
    numerous than in other breeds. From their manner of standing their
    legs appear longer than they really are, though, in proportion with
    those of <I>C. livia</I>, the legs and feet are actually longer.
    The wings appear much elongated, but by measurement, in relation to
    the length of body, this is not the case. The beak likewise appears
    longer, but it is in fact a little shorter (about &#183;03 of an
    inch), proportionally with the size of the body, and relatively to
    the beak of the rock-pigeon. The Pouter, though not bulky, is a
    large bird; I measured one which was 34&#189; inches from tip to
    tip of wing, and 19 inches from tip of beak to end of tail. In a
    wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands the same measurements
    gave only 28&#188; and 14&#190;. There are many sub-varieties of
    the Pouter of different colours, but these I pass over.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race II. Dutch
    Pouter.</I>&#8212;This seems to be the parent-form of our improved
    English Pouters. I kept a pair, but I suspect that they were not
    pure birds. They are smaller than English pouters, and less well
    developed in all their characters. Neumeister<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> says that the wings are crossed over the
    tail, and do not reach to its extremity.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race III. The Lille
    Pouter.</I>&#8212;I know this breed only from description.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> It approaches in general form the Dutch
    Pouter, but the inflated &#156;sophagus assumes a spherical form,
    as if the pigeon had swallowed a large orange, which had stuck
    close under the beak. This inflated ball is represented as rising
    to a level with the crown of the head. The middle toe alone is
    feathered. A variety of this sub-race, called the claquant, is
    described by MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233;; it pouts but little, and
    is characterised by the habit of violently hitting its wings
    together over its back,&#8212;a habit which the English Pouter has
    in a slight degree.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race IV. Common German
    Pouter.</I>&#8212;I know this bird only from the figures and
    description given by the accurate Neumeister, one of the few
    writers on pigeons who, as I have found, may always be trusted.
    This sub-race seems considerably different. The upper part of the
    &#156;sophagus is much less distended. The bird stands less
    upright. The feet are not feathered, and the legs and beak are
    shorter. In these respects there is an approach in form to the
    common rock-pigeon. The tail-feathers are very long, yet the tips
    of the closed wings extend beyond the end of the tail; and the
    length of the wings, from tip to tip, and of the body, is greater
    than in the English Pouter.</SMALL></P>

      <H4>GROUP II.</H4>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This group includes three Races, namely,
    Carriers, Runts, and Barbs, which are manifestly allied to each
    other. Indeed, certain carriers and runts pass into each other by
    such insensible gradations that an arbitrary line has to be drawn
    between them. Carriers also graduate through foreign breeds into
    the rock-pigeon. Yet, if well-characterised Carriers and Barbs (see
    figs 19 and 20) had existed as wild species, no ornithologist would
    have placed them in the same genus with each other or with the
    rock-pigeon. This group may, as a general rule, be recognised by
    the beak being long, with the skin over the nostrils swollen and
    often carunculated or wattled, and with that round the eyes bare
    and likewise carunculated. The mouth is very wide, and the feet are
    large. Nevertheless the Barb, which must be classed in this same
    group, has a very short beak, and some runts have very little bare
    skin round their eyes.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <B>Race II.&#8212;Carriers.</B><BR>
      (T&#252;rkische Tauben; pigeons turcs, dragons.)
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Beak elongated, narrow, pointed; eyes
    surrounded by much naked, generally carunculated, skin; neck and
    body elongated.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race I. The English
    Carrier.</I>&#8212;This is a fine bird, of large size, close
    feathered, generally dark-coloured, with an elongated neck. The
    beak is attenuated and of wonderful length: in one specimen it was
    1&#183;4 inch in length from the feathered base to the tip;
    therefore nearly twice as long as that of the rock-pigeon, which
    measured only &#183;77. Whenever I compare proportionally any part
    in the carrier and rock-pigeon, I take the length of the body from
    the base of the beak to the end of the tail as the standard of
    comparison; and according to this standard, the beak in one Carrier
    was nearly half an inch longer than in the rock-pigeon. The upper
    mandible is often slightly arched. The tongue is very long. The
    development of the carunculated skin or wattle round the eyes, over
    the nostrils, and on the lower mandible, is prodigious. The
    eyelids, measured longitudinally, were in some specimens exactly
    twice as long as in the rock-pigeon. The external orifice or furrow
    of the nostrils was also twice as long. The open mouth in its
    widest part was in one case &#183;75 of an inch in width, whereas
    in the rock-pigeon it is only about &#183;4 of an inch. This great
    width of mouth is shown in the skeleton by the reflexed edges of
    the ramus of the lower jaw. The head is flat on the summit and
    narrow between the orbits. The feet are large and coarse; the
    length, as measured from end of hind toe to end of middle toe
    (without the claws), was in two specimens 2&#183;6 inches; and
    this, proportionally with the rock-pigeon, is an excess of nearly a
    quarter of an inch. One very fine Carrier measured 31&#189; inches
    from tip to tip of wing. Birds of this sub-race are too valuable to
    be flown as carriers.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race II. Dragons; Persian
    Carriers.</I>&#8212;The English Dragon differs from the improved
    English Carrier in being smaller in all its dimensions, and in
    having less wattle round the eyes and over the nostrils, and none
    on the lower mandible. Sir W. Elliot sent me from Madras a Bagdad
    Carrier (sometimes called khandesi), the name of which shows its
    Persian origin: it would be considered here a very poor Dragon; the
    body was of the size of the rock-pigeon, with the beak a little
    longer, namely, 1 inch from the tip to the feathered base. The skin
    round the eyes was only slightly wattled, whilst that over the
    nostrils was fairly wattled. The Hon. C. Murray, also, sent me two
    Carriers direct from Persia; these had nearly the same character as
    the Madras bird, being about as large as the rock-pigeon, but the
    beak in one specimen was as much as 1&#183;15 in length; the skin
    over the nostrils was only moderately, and that round the eyes
    scarcely at all wattled.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race III. Bagadotten-Tauben of
    Neumeister</I> (Pavdotten-or Hocker-Tauben).&#8212;I owe to the
    kindness of Mr. Baily, jun., a dead specimen of this singular breed
    imported from Germany. It is certainly allied to the Runts;
    nevertheless, from its close affinity with Carriers, it will be
    convenient here to describe it. The beak is long, and is hooked or
    bowed downwards in a highly remarkable manner, as will be seen in
    fig. 24-D when I treat of the skeleton. The eyes are surrounded by
    a wide space of bright red skin, which, as well as that over the
    nostrils, is moderately wattled. The breast-bone is remarkably
    protuberant, being abruptly bowed outwards. The feet and tarsi are
    of great length, larger than in first-rate English Carriers. The
    whole bird is of large size, but in proportion to the size of the
    body the feathers of the wing and tail are short; a wild
    rock-pigeon, of considerably less size, had tail-feathers 4&#183;6
    inches in length, whereas in the large Bagadotten these feathers
    were scarcely over 4&#183;1 inches in length. Riedel<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> remarks that it is a very silent
    bird.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race IV. Bussorah
    Carrier.</I>&#8212;Two specimens were sent me by Sir W. Elliot from
    Madras, one in spirits and the other skinned. The name shows its
    Persian origin. It is much valued in India, and is considered as a
    distinct breed from the Bagdad Carrier, which forms my second
    sub-race. At first I suspected that these two sub-races might have
    been recently formed by crosses with other breeds, though the
    estimation in which they are held renders this improbable; but in a
    Persian treatise,<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> believed to
    have been written about 100 years ago, the Bagdad and Bussorah
    breeds are described as distinct. The Bussorah Carrier is of about
    the same size as the wild rock-pigeon. The shape of the beak, with
    some little carunculated skin over the nostrils,&#8212; the much
    elongated eyelids,&#8212;the broad mouth measured
    internally,&#8212;the narrow head,&#8212;the feet proportionally a
    little longer than in the rock-pigeon,&#8212;and the general
    appearance, all show that this bird is an undoubted Carrier; yet in
    one specimen the beak was of exactly the same length as in the
    rock-pigeon. In the other specimen the beak (as well as the opening
    of the nostrils) was only a very little longer, viz., by &#183;08
    of an inch. Although there was a considerable space of bare and
    slightly carunculated skin round the eyes, that over the nostrils
    was only in a slight degree rugose. Sir W. Elliot informs me that
    in the living bird the eye seems remarkably large and prominent,
    and the same fact is noticed in the Persian treatise; but the bony
    orbit is barely larger than that in the rock-pigeon.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Amongst the several breeds sent to me from
    Madras by Sir W. Elliot there is a pair of the <I>Kali Par</I>,
    black birds with the beak slightly elongated, with the skin over
    the nostrils rather full, and with a little naked skin round the
    eyes. This breed seems more closely allied to the Carrier than to
    any other breed, being nearly intermediate between the Bussorah
    Carrier and the rock-pigeon.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The names applied in different parts of
    Europe and in India to the several kinds of Carriers all point to
    Persia or the surrounding countries as the source of this Race. And
    it deserves especial notice that, even if we neglect the Kali Par
    as of doubtful origin, we get a series broken by very small steps,
    from the rock-pigeon, through the Bussorah, which sometimes has a
    beak not at all longer than that of the rock-pigeon and with the
    naked skin round the eyes and over the nostrils very slightly
    swollen and carunculated, through the Bagdad sub-race and Dragons,
    to our improved English Carriers, which present so marvellous a
    difference from the rock-pigeon or <I>Columba
    livia.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Inextricable confusion reigns in the
    classification, affinities, and naming of Runts. Several characters
    which are generally pretty constant in other pigeons, such as the
    length of the wings, tail, legs, and neck, and the amount of naked
    skin round the eyes, are excessively variable in Runts. When the
    naked skin over the nostrils and round the eyes is considerably
    developed and wattled, and when the size of body is not very great,
    Runts graduate in so insensible a manner into Carriers, that the
    distinction is quite arbitrary. This fact is likewise shown by the
    names given to them in different parts of Europe. Nevertheless,
    taking the most distinct forms, at least five sub-races (some of
    them including well-marked varieties) can be distinguished, which
    differ in such important points of structure, that they would be
    considered as good species in a state of nature.</SMALL></P>

    Neumeister only in not having the beak nearly so much curved
    downwards, and in the naked skin round the eyes and over the
    nostrils being hardly at all wattled. Nevertheless I have felt
    myself compelled to place the Bagadotten in Race II., or that of
    the Carriers, and the present bird in Race III., or that of the
    Runts. The Scanderoon has a very short, narrow, and elevated tail;
    wings extremely short, so that the first primary feathers were not
    longer than those of a small tumbler pigeon! Neck long, much bowed;
    breast-bone prominent. Beak long, being 1&#183;15 inch from tip to
    feathered base; vertically thick; slightly curved downwards. The
    skin over the nostrils swollen, not wattled; naked skin round the
    eyes, broad, slightly carunculated. Legs long; feet very large.
    Skin of neck bright red, often showing a naked medial line, with a
    naked red patch at the distal end of the radius of the wing. My
    bird, as measured from the base of the beak to the root of the
    tail, was fully 2 inches longer than the rock-pigeon; yet the tail
    itself was only 4 inches in length, whereas in the rock-pigeon,
    which is a much smaller bird, the tail is 4-5/8 inches in
    length.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The Hinkel-or Florentiner Taube of
    Neumeister (Table 13 fig. 1) agrees with the above description in
    all the specified characters (for the beak is not mentioned),
    except that Neumeister expressly says that the neck is short,
    whereas in my Scanderoon it was remarkably long and bowed; so that
    the Hinkel forms a well-marked variety.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race II. Pigeon cygne and Pigeon
    bagadais of Boitard and Corbi&#233;</I> (Scanderoon of French
    writers).&#8212;I kept two of these birds alive, imported from
    France. They differed from the first sub-race or true Scanderoon in
    the much greater length of the wing and tail, in the beak not being
    so long, and in the skin about the head being more carunculated.
    The skin of the neck is red; but the naked patches on the wings are
    absent. One of my birds measured 38&#189; inches from tip to tip of
    wing. By taking the length of the body as the standard of
    comparison, the two wings were no less than 5 inches longer than
    those of the rock-pigeon! The tail was 6&#188; inches in length,
    and therefore 2&#188; inches longer than that of the
    Scanderoon,&#8212;a bird of nearly the same size. The beak is
    longer, thicker, and broader than in the rock-pigeon,
    proportionally with the size of body. The eyelids, nostrils, and
    internal gape of mouth are all proportionally very large, as in
    Carriers. The foot, from the end of the middle to end of hind toe,
    was actually 2&#183;85 inches in length, which is an excess of
    &#183;32 of an inch over the foot of the rock-pigeon,
    proportionally to the relative size of the two birds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race III. Spanish and Roman
    Runts.</I>&#8212;I am not sure that I am right in placing these
    Runts in a distinct sub-race; yet, if we take well-characterised
    birds, there can be no doubt of the propriety of the separation.
    They are heavy, massive birds, with shorter necks, legs, and beaks
    than in the foregoing races. The skin over the nostrils is swollen,
    but not carunculated; the naked skin round the eyes is not very
    wide, and only slightly carunculated; and I have seen a fine
    so-called Spanish Runt with hardly any naked skin round the eyes.
    Of the two varieties to be seen in England, one, which is the
    rarer, has very long wings and tail, and agrees pretty closely with
    the last sub-race; the other, with shorter wings and tail, is
    apparently the <I>Pigeon romain ordinaire</I> of Boitard and
    Corbi&#233;. These Runts are apt to tremble like Fantails. They are
    bad flyers. A few years ago Mr. Gulliver<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> exhibited a Runt which weighed 1 pound
    14 ounces; and, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, two Runts from
    the south of France were lately exhibited at the Crystal Palace,
    each of which weighed 2 pounds 2&#189; ounces. A very fine
    rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands weighed only 14&#189;
    ounces.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race IV. Tronfo of Aldrovandi</I>
    (Leghorn Runt?).&#8212;In Aldrovandi's work published in 1600 there
    is a coarse woodcut of a great Italian pigeon, with an elevated
    tail, short legs, massive body, and with the beak short and thick.
    I had imagined that this latter character so abnormal in the group,
    was merely a false representation from bad drawing; but Moore, in
    his work published in 1735, says that he possessed a Leghorn Runt
    of which "the beak was very short for so large a bird." In other
    respects Moore's bird resembled the first sub-race or Scanderoon,
    for it had a long bowed neck, long legs, short beak, and elevated
    tail, and not much wattle about the head. So that Aldrovandi's and
    Moore's birds must have formed distinct varieties, both of which
    seem to be now extinct in Europe. Sir W. Elliot, however, informs
    me that he has seen in Madras a short-beaked Runt imported from
    Cairo.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race V. Murassa (adorned Pigeon)
    of Madras.</I>&#8212;Skins of these handsome chequered birds were
    sent me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot. They are rather larger than
    the largest rock-pigeon, with longer and more massive beaks. The
    skin over the nostrils is rather full and very slightly
    carunculated, and they have some naked skin round the eyes; feet
    large. This breed is intermediate between the rock-pigeon and a
    very poor variety of Runt or Carrier.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From these several descriptions we see
    that with Runts, as with Carriers, we have a fine gradation from
    the rock-pigeon (with the Tronfo diverging as a distinct branch) to
    our largest and most massive Runts. But the chain of affinities,
    and many points of resemblance, between Runts and carriers, make me
    believe that these two races have not descended by independent
    lines from the rock-pigeon, but from some common parent, as
    represented in the Table, which had already acquired a moderately
    long beak with slightly swollen skin over the nostrils, and with
    some slightly carunculated naked skin round the eyes.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Misled by the extraordinary shortness and
    form of the beak, I did not at first perceive the near affinity of
    this Race to that of Carriers until the fact was pointed out to me
    by Mr. Brent. Subsequently, after examining the Bussorah Carrier, I
    saw that no very great amount of modification would be requisite to
    convert it into a Barb. This view of the affinity of Barbs to
    Carriers is supported by the analogical difference between the
    short and long-beaked Runts; and still more strongly by the fact,
    that, young Barbs and Dragons, within 24 hours after being hatched,
    resemble each other much more closely than do young pigeons of
    other and equally distinct breeds. At this early age, the length of
    beak, the swollen skin over the rather open nostrils, the gape of
    the mouth, and the size of the feet, are the same in both; although
    these parts afterwards become widely different. We thus see that
    embryology (as the comparison of very young animals may perhaps be
    called) comes into play in the classification of domestic
    varieties, as with species in a state of nature.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Fanciers, with some truth, compare the
    head and beak of the Barb to that of a bullfinch. The Barb, if
    found in a state of nature would certainly have been placed in a
    new genus formed for its reception. The body is a little larger
    than that of the rock-pigeon, but the beak is more than &#183;2 of
    an inch shorter; although shorter, it is both vertically and
    horizontally thicker. From the outward flexure of the rami of the
    lower jaw, the mouth internally is very broad, in the proportion of
    &#183;6 to &#183;4 to that of the rock-pigeon. The whole head is
    broad. The skin over the nostril is swollen, but not carunculated,
    except slightly in first-rate birds when old; whilst the naked skin
    round the eye is broad and much carunculated. It is sometimes so
    much developed, that a bird belonging to Mr. Harrison Weir could
    hardly see to pick up food from the ground. The eyelids in one
    specimen were nearly twice as long as those of the rock-pigeon. The
    feet are coarse and strong, but proportionally rather shorter than
    in the rock-pigeon. The plumage is generally dark and uniform.
    Barbs, in short, may be called short-beaked Carriers, bearing the
    same relation to Carriers that the Tronfo of Aldrovandi does to the
    common Runt.</SMALL></P>

    have counted in one of my own birds 33, and at Calcutta Mr. Blyth<A

    tail 34 feathers. In Madras, as I am informed by Sir W. Elliot, 32
    is the standard number; but in England number is much less valued
    than the position and expansion of the tail. The feathers are
    arranged in an irregular double row; their permanent fanlike
    expansion and their upward direction are more remarkable characters
    than their increased number. The tail is capable of the same
    movements as in other pigeons, and can be depressed so as to sweep
    the ground. It arises from a more expanded basis than in other
    pigeons; and in three skeletons there were one or two extra
    coccygeal vertebr&#230;. I have examined many specimens of various
    colours from different countries, and there was no trace of the
    oil-gland; this is a curious case of abortion.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> The neck is thin and bowed backwards.
    The breast is broad and protuberant. The feet are small. The
    carriage of the bird is very different from that of other pigeons;
    in good birds the head touches the tail-feathers, which
    consequently often become crumpled. They habitually tremble much:
    and their necks have an extraordinary, apparently convulsive,
    backward and forward movement. Good birds walk in a singular
    manner, as if their small feet were stiff. Owing to their large
    tails, they fly badly on a windy day. The dark-coloured varieties
    are generally larger than white Fantails.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Although between the best and common
    Fantails, now existing in England, there is a vast difference in
    the position and size of the tail, in the carriage of the head and
    neck, in the convulsive movements of the neck, in the manner of
    walking, and in the breadth of the breast, the differences so
    graduate away, that it is impossible to make more than one
    sub-race. Moore, however, an excellent old authority<A href=

    of broad-tailed shakers (<I>i.e.</I> Fantails), "one having a neck
    much longer and more slender than the other;" and I am informed by
    Mr. B. P. Brent, that there is an existing German Fantail with a

    from Java. It was coloured in a peculiar manner, unlike any
    European Fantail; and, for a Fantail, had a remarkably short beak.
    Although a good bird of the kind, it had only 14 tail-feathers; but
    Mr. Swinhoe has counted in other birds of this breed from 18 to 24
    tail-feathers. From a rough sketch sent to me, it is evident that
    the tail is not so much expanded or so much upraised as in even
    second-rate European Fantails. The bird shakes its neck like our
    Fantails. It had a well-developed oil-gland. Fantails were known in
    India, as We shall hereafter see, before the year 1600; and we may
    suspect that in the Java Fantail we see the breed in its earlier
    and less improved condition.</SMALL></P>

    can be recognised at once by the feathers irregularly diverging,
    like a frill, along the front of the neck, in the same manner, but
    in a less degree, as along the back of the neck in the Jacobin.
    They have the remarkable habit of continually and momentarily
    inflating the upper part of the &#156;sophagus, which causes a
    movement in the frill. When the &#156;sophagus of a dead bird is
    inflated, it is seen to be larger than in other breeds, and not so
    distinctly separated from the crop. The Pouter inflates both its
    true crop and &#156;sophagus; the Turbit inflates in a much less
    degree the &#156;sophagus alone. The beak of the Turbit is very
    short, being &#183;28 of an inch shorter than that of the
    rock-pigeon, proportionally with the size of their bodies; and in
    some owls brought by Mr. E. Vernon Harcourt from Tunis, it was even

    I have examined eight skeletons of various kinds of Tumblers:

    ribs.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race I. Persian
    Tumblers.</I>&#8212;I received a pair direct from Persia, from the
    Hon. C. Murray. They are rather smaller birds than the wild
    rock-pigeon, about the size of the common dovecot pigeon, white and
    mottled, slightly feathered on the feet, with the beak just
    perceptibly shorter than in the rock-pigeon. H.M. Consul, Mr. Keith
    Abbott, informs me that the difference in the length of beak is so
    slight, that only practised Persian fanciers can distinguish these
    Tumblers from the common pigeon of the country. He informs me that
    they fly in flocks high up in the air and tumble well. Some of them
    occasionally appear to become giddy and tumble to the ground, in
    which respect they resemble some of our Tumblers.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race II. Lotan, or Lowtun: Indian
    Ground Tumblers.</I>&#8212;These birds present one of the most
    remarkable inherited habits or instincts ever recorded. The
    specimens sent to me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot are white,
    slightly feathered on the feet, with the feathers on the head
    reversed; and they are rather smaller than the rock or dovecot
    pigeon. The beak is proportionally only slightly shorter and rather
    thinner than in the rock-pigeon. These birds when gently shaken and
    placed on the ground immediately begin tumbling head over heels,
    and they continue thus to tumble until taken up and
    soothed,&#8212;the ceremony being generally to blow in their faces,
    as in recovering a person from a state of hypnotism or mesmerism.
    It is asserted that they will continue to roll over till they die,
    if not taken up. There is abundant evidence with respect to these
    remarkable peculiarities; but what makes the case the more worthy
    of attention is, that the habit has been inherited since before the
    year 1600, for the breed is distinctly described in the 'Ayeen
    Akbery.'<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> Mr. Evans kept a pair in
    London, imported by Captain Vigne; and he assures me that he has
    seen them tumble in the air, as well as in the manner above
    described on the ground. Sir W. Elliot, however, writes to me from
    Madras, that he is informed that they tumble exclusively on the
    ground, or at a very small height above it. He also mentions birds
    of another sub-variety, called the Kalmi Lotan, which begin to roll
    over if only touched on the neck with a rod or wand.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race III. Common English
    Tumblers.</I>&#8212;These birds have exactly the same habits as the
    Persian Tumbler, but tumble better. The English bird is rather
    smaller than the Persian, and the beak is plainly shorter. Compared
    with the rock-pigeon, and proportionally with the size of body, the
    beak is from &#183;15 to nearly &#183;2 of an inch shorter, but it
    is not thinner. There are several varieties of the common Tumbler,
    namely, Baldheads, Beards, and Dutch Rollers. I have kept the
    latter alive; they have differently shaped heads, longer necks, and
    are feather-footed. They tumble to an extraordinary degree; as Mr.
    Brent remarks,<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> "Every few seconds
    over they go; one, two, or three summersaults at a time. Here and
    there a bird gives a very quick and rapid spin, revolving like a
    wheel, though they sometimes lose their balance, and make a rather
    ungraceful fall, in which they occasionally hurt themselves by
    striking some object." From Madras I have received several
    specimens of the common Tumbler of India, differing slightly from
    each other in the length of their beaks. Mr. Brent sent me a dead
    specimen of a "House-tumbler,"<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
    which is a Scotch variety, not differing in general appearance and
    form of beak from the common Tumbler. Mr. Brent states that these
    birds generally begin to tumble "almost as soon as they can well
    fly; at three months old they tumble well, but still fly strong; at
    five or six months they tumble excessively; and in the second year
    they mostly give up flying, on account of their tumbling so much
    and so close to the ground. Some fly round with the flock, throwing
    a clean summersault every few yards, till they are obliged to
    settle from giddiness and exhaustion. These are called Air
    Tumblers, and they commonly throw from twenty to thirty
    summersaults in a minute, each clear and clean. I have one red cock
    that I have on two or three occasions timed by my watch, and
    counted forty summersaults in the minute. Others tumble
    differently. At first they throw a single summersault, then it is
    double, till it becomes a continuous roll, which puts an end to
    flying, for if they fly a few yards over they go, and roll till
    they reach the ground. Thus I had one kill herself, and another
    broke his leg. Many of them turn over only a few inches from the
    ground, and will tumble two or three times in flying across their
    loft. These are called House-tumblers, from tumbling in the house.
    The act of tumbling seems to be one over which they have no
    control, an involuntary movement which they seem to try to prevent.
    I have seen a bird sometimes in his struggles fly a yard or two
    straight upwards, the impulse forcing him backwards while he
    struggles to go forwards. If suddenly startled, or in a strange
    place, they seem less able to fly than if quiet in their accustomed
    loft." These House-tumblers differ from the Lotan or Ground Tumbler
    of India, in not requiring to be shaken in order to begin tumbling.
    The breed has probably been formed merely by selecting the best
    common Tumblers, though it is possible that they may have been
    crossed at some former period with Lotans.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Sub-race IV. Short-faced
    Tumblers.</I>&#8212;These are marvellous birds, and are the glory
    and pride of many fanciers. In their extremely short, sharp, and
    conical beaks, with the skin over the nostrils but little
    developed, they almost depart from the type of the Columbid&#230;.
    Their heads are nearly globular and upright in front, so that some
    fanciers say<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> "the head should
    resemble a cherry with a barleycorn stuck in it." These are the
    smallest kind of pigeons. Mr. Esquilant possessed a blue Baldhead,
    two years old, which when alive weighed, before feeding-time, only
    6 ounces 5 drs.; two others, each weighed 7 ounces. We have seen
    that a wild rock-pigeon weighed 14 ounces 2 drs., and a Runt 34
    ounces 4 drs. Short-faced Tumblers have a remarkably erect
    carriage, with prominent breasts, drooping wings, and very small
    feet. The length of the beak from the tip to the feathered base was
    in one good bird only &#183;4 of an inch; in a wild rock-pigeon it
    was exactly double this length. As these Tumblers have shorter
    bodies than the wild rock-pigeon, they ought of course to have
    shorter beaks; but proportionally with the size of the body, the
    beak is &#183;28 of an inch too short. So, again, the feet of this
    bird were actually &#183;45 shorter, and proportionally &#183;21 of
    an inch shorter, than the feet of the rock-pigeon. The middle toe
    has only twelve or thirteen, instead of fourteen or fifteen
    scutell&#230;. The primary wing-feathers are not rarely nine
    instead of ten in number. The improved short-faced Tumblers have
    almost lost the power of tumbling; but there are several authentic
    accounts of their occasionally tumbling. There are several
    sub-varieties, such as Bald-heads, Beards, Mottles, and Almonds;
    the latter are remarkable from not acquiring their
    perfectly-coloured plumage until they have moulted three or four
    times. There is good reason to believe that most of these
    sub-varieties, some of which breed truly, have arisen since the
    publication of Moore's treatise in 1735.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Finally, in regard to the whole group of

    short-faced birds; which latter, no ornithologist, judging from
    mere external structure, would place in the same genus with the
    rock-pigeon. The differences between the successive steps in this
    series are not greater than those which may be observed between
    common dovecot-pigeons (<I>C. livia</I>) brought from different

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Beak very short; feathers reversed.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>A specimen of this bird, in spirits, was
    sent to me from Madras by Sir W. Elliot. It is wholly different
    from the Frill-back often exhibited in England. It is a smallish
    bird, about the size of the common Tumbler, but has a beak in all
    its proportions like our short-faced Tumblers. The beak, measured
    from the tip to the feathered base, was only &#183;46 of an inch in
    length. The feathers over the whole body are reversed or curl
    backwards. Had this bird occurred in Europe, I should have thought
    it only a monstrous variety of our improved Tumbler: but as
    short-faced Tumblers are not known in India, I think it must rank
    as a distinct breed. Probably this is the breed seen by Hasselquist
    in 1757 at Cairo, and said to have been imported from
    India.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This pigeon can at once be recognised by
    its hood, almost enclosing the head and meeting in front of the
    neck. The hood seems to be merely an exaggeration of the crest of
    reversed feathers on the back of the head, which is common to many
    sub-varieties, and which in the Latztaube<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> is in a nearly intermediate state
    between a hood and a crest. The feathers of the hood are elongated.
    Both the wings and tail are likewise much elongated; thus the
    folded wing of the Jacobin, though a somewhat smaller bird, is
    fully 1&#188; inch longer than in the rock-pigeon. Taking the
    length of the body without the tail as the standard of comparison,
    the folded wing, proportionally with the wings of the rock-pigeon,
    is 2&#188; inches too long, and the two wings, from tip to tip,
    5&#188; inches too long. In disposition this bird is singularly
    quiet, seldom flying or moving about, as Bechstein and Riedel have
    likewise remarked in Germany.<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> The
    latter author also notices the length of the wings and tail. The
    beak is nearly &#183;2 of an inch shorter in proportion to the size
    of the body than in the rock-pigeon; but the internal gape of the
    mouth is considerably wider.</SMALL></P>

    in the beak, to the rock-pigeon. The Trumpeter forms the only
    well-marked race. Of the numerous other sub-races and varieties I

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This is a well-marked breed, with a
    peculiar voice, wholly unlike that of any other pigeon. The coo is
    rapidly repeated, and is continued for several minutes; hence their
    name of Trumpeters. They are also characterised by a tuft of
    elongated feathers, which curls forward over the base of the beak,
    and which is possessed by no other breed. Their feet are so heavily
    feathered, that they almost appear like little wings. They are
    larger birds than the rock-pigeon, but their beak is of very nearly
    the same proportional size. Their feet are rather small. This breed
    was perfectly characterised in Moore's time, in 1735. Mr. Brent
    says that two varieties exist, which differ in size.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race I. Laughers.&#8212;Size less
    than the Rock-pigeon; voice very peculiar.</I>&#8212;As this bird
    agrees in nearly all its proportions with the rock-pigeon, though
    of smaller size, I should not have thought it worthy of mention,
    had it not been for its peculiar voice&#8212;a character supposed
    seldom to vary with birds. Although the voice of the Laugher is
    very different from that of the Trumpeter, yet one of my Trumpeters
    used to utter a single note like that of the Laugher. I have kept
    two varieties of Laughers, which differed only in one variety being
    turn-crowned; the smooth-headed kind, for which I am indebted to
    the kindness of Mr. Brent, besides its peculiar note, used to coo
    in a singular and pleasing manner, which, independently, struck
    both Mr. Brent and myself as resembling that of the turtle-dove.
    Both varieties come from Arabia. This breed was known by Moore in
    1735. A pigeon which seems to say Yak-roo is mentioned in 1600 in
    the 'Ayeen Akbery' and is probably the same breed. Sir W. Elliot
    has also sent me from Madras a pigeon called Yahui, said to have
    come from Mecca, which does not differ in appearance from the
    Laugher; it has "a deep melancholy voice, like Yahu, often
    repeated." Yahu, yahu, means Oh God, oh God; and Sayzid Mohammed
    Musari, in the treatise written about 100 years ago, says that
    these birds "are not flown, because they repeat the name of the
    most high God." Mr. Keith Abbott, however, informs me that the
    common pigeon is called Yahoo in Persia.</SMALL></P>

    (die Strupptaube).&#8212;<I>Beak rather longer than in the

    larger bird than the rock-pigeon, and with the beak, proportionally
    with the size of body, a little (viz. by &#183;04 of an inch)
    longer. The feathers, especially on the wing-coverts, have their
    points curled upwards or back-wards.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race III. Nuns</I> (Pigeons
    coquilles).&#8212;These elegant birds are smaller than the
    rock-pigeon. The beak is actually 1&#183;7, and proportionally with
    the size of the body &#183;1 of an inch shorter than in the
    rock-pigeons, although of the same thickness. In young birds the
    scutell&#230; on the tarsi and toes are generally of a leaden-black
    colour; and this is a remarkable character (though observed in a
    lesser degree in some other breeds), as the colour of the legs in
    the adult state is subject to very little variation in any breed. I
    have on two or three occasions counted thirteen or fourteen
    feathers in the tail; this likewise occurs in the barely distinct
    breed called Helmets. Nuns are symmetrically coloured, with the
    head, primary wing-feathers, tail, and tail-coverts of the same
    colour, namely, black or red, and with the rest of the body white.
    This breed has retained the same character since Aldrovandi wrote
    in 1600. I have received from Madras almost similarly coloured
    birds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race IV. Spots</I> (die
    Blasstauben; pigeons heurt&#233;s).&#8212;These birds are a very
    little larger than the rock-pigeon, with the beak a trace smaller
    in all its dimensions, and with the feet decidedly smaller. They
    are symmetrically coloured, with a spot on the forehead, with the
    tail and tail-coverts of the same colour, the rest of the body
    being white. This breed existed in 1676;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> and in 1735 Moore remarks that they
    breed truly, as is the case at the present day.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Sub-race V. Swallows.</I>&#8212;These
    birds, as measured from tip to tip of wing, or from the end of the
    beak to the end of the tail, exceed in size the rock-pigeon; but
    their bodies are much less bulky; their feet and legs are likewise
    smaller. The beak is of about the same length, but rather slighter.
    Altogether their general appearance is considerably different from
    that of the rock-pigeon. Their heads and wings are of the same
    colour, the rest of the body being white. Their flight is said to
    be peculiar. This seems to be a modern breed, which, however,
    originated before the year 1795 in Germany, for it is described by
    Bechstein.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Besides the several breeds now described,
    three or four other very distinct kinds existed lately, or perhaps
    still exist, in Germany and France. Firstly, the Karmeliten, or
    carme pigeon, which I have not seen; it is described as of small
    size, with very short legs, and with an extremely short beak.
    Secondly, the Finnikin, which is now extinct in England. It had,
    according to Moore's<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> treatise,
    published in 1735, a tuft of feathers on the hinder part of the
    head, which ran down its back not unlike a horse's mane. "When it
    is salacious it rises over the hen and turns round three or four
    times, flapping its wings, then reverses and turns as many times
    the other way." The Turner, on the other hand, when it "plays to
    the female, turns only one way." Whether these extraordinary
    statements may be trusted I know not; but the inheritance of any
    habit may be believed, after what we have seen with respect to the
    Ground-tumbler of India. MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233; describe a
    pigeon<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> which has the singular
    habit of sailing for a considerable time through the air, without
    flapping its wings, like a bird of prey. The confusion is
    inextricable, from the time of Aldrovandi in 1600 to the present
    day, in the accounts published of the Draijers, Smiters, Finnikins,
    Turners, Claquers, etc., which are all remarkable from their manner
    of flight. Mr. Brent informs me that he has seen one of these
    breeds in Germany with its wing-feathers injured from having been
    so often struck together but he did not see it flying. An old
    stuffed specimen of a Finnikin in the British Museum presents no
    well-marked character. Thirdly, a singular pigeon with a forked
    tail is mentioned in some treatises; and as Bechstein<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> briefly describes and figures this bird,
    with a tail "having completely the structure of that of the
    house-swallow," it must once have existed, for Bechstein was far
    too good a naturalist to have confounded any distinct species with
    the domestic pigeon. Lastly, an extraordinary pigeon imported from
    Belgium has lately been exhibited at the Philoperisteron Society in
    London,<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> which "conjoins the
    colour of an archangel with the head of an owl or barb, its most
    striking peculiarity being the extraordinary length of the tail and
    wing-feathers, the latter crossing beyond the tail, and giving to
    the bird the appearance of a gigantic swift (Cypselus), or
    long-winged hawk." Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that this bird weighed
    only 10 ounces, but in length was 15&#189; inches from tip to beak
    to end of tail, and 32&#189; inches from tip to tip of wing; now
    the wild rock-pigeon weighs 14&#189; ounces, and measures from tip
    to beak to end of tail 15 inches, and from tip to tip of wing only
    26&#190; inches.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have now described all the domestic pigeons
    known to me, and have added a few others on reliable authority. I
    have classed them under four Groups, in order to mark their
    affinities and degrees of difference; but the third group is
    artificial. The kinds examined by me form eleven races, which
    include several sub-races; and even these latter present
    differences that would certainly have been thought of specific
    value if observed in a state of nature. The sub-races likewise
    include many strictly inherited varieties; so that altogether there
    must exist, as previously remarked, above 150 kinds which can be
    distinguished, though generally by characters of extremely slight
    importance. Many of the genera of the Columbid&#230;, admitted by
    ornithologists, do not differ in any great degree from each other;
    taking this into consideration, there can be no doubt that several
    of the most strongly characterised domestic forms, if found wild,
    would have been placed in at least five new genera. Thus a new
    genus would have been formed for the reception of the improved
    English Pouter: a second genus for Carriers and Runts; and this
    would have been a wide or comprehensive genus, for it would have
    admitted common Spanish Runts without any wattle, short-beaked
    Runts like the Tronfo, and the improved English Carrier: a third
    genus would have been formed for the Barb: a fourth for the
    Fantail: and lastly, a fifth for the short beaked, not-wattled
    pigeons, such as Turbits and short-faced Tumblers. The remaining
    domestic forms might have been included, in the same genus with the
    wild rock-pigeon.</P>

    <P align="CENTER"><I>Individual Variability; variations of a
    remarkable nature.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The differences which we have as yet considered
    are characteristic of distinct breeds; but there are other
    differences, either confined to individual birds, or often observed
    in certain breeds but not characteristic of them. These individual
    differences are of importance, as they might in most cases be
    secured and accumulated by man's power of selection and thus an
    existing breed might be greatly modified or a new one formed.
    Fanciers notice and select only those slight differences which are
    externally visible; but the whole organisation is so tied together
    by correlation of growth, that a change in one part is frequently
    accompanied by other changes. For our purpose, modifications of all
    kinds are equally important, and if affecting a part which does not
    commonly vary, are of more importance than a modification in some
    conspicuous part. At the present day any visible deviation of
    character in a well-established breed is rejected as a blemish; but
    it by no means follows that at an early period, before well-marked
    breeds had been formed, such deviations would have been rejected;
    on the contrary, they would have been eagerly preserved as
    presenting a novelty, and would then have been slowly augmented, as
    we shall hereafter more clearly see, by the process of unconscious
    selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have made numerous measurements of the
    various parts of the body in the several breeds, and have hardly
    ever found them quite the same in birds of the same
    breed,&#8212;the differences being greater than we commonly meet
    with in wild species within the same district. To begin with the
    primary feathers of the wing and tail; but I must first mention, as
    some readers may not be aware of the fact, that the number of the
    primary wing and tail-feathers in wild birds is generally constant,
    and characterises, not only whole genera, but even whole families.
    When the tail-feathers are unusually numerous, as for instance in
    the swan, they are apt to be variable in number; but this does not
    apply to the several species and genera of the Columbid&#230;,
    which never (as far as I can hear) have less than twelve or more
    than sixteen tail-feathers; and these numbers characterise, with
    rare exception, whole sub-families.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> The wild rock-pigeon has twelve
    tail-feathers. With Fantails, as we have seen, the number varies
    from fourteen to forty-two. In two young birds in the same nest I
    counted twenty-two and twenty-seven feathers. Pouters are very
    liable to have additional tail-feathers, and I have seen on several
    occasions fourteen or fifteen in my own birds. Mr. Bult had a
    specimen, examined by Mr. Yarrell, with seventeen tail-feathers. I
    had a Nun with thirteen, and another with fourteen tail-feathers;
    and in a Helmet, a breed barely distinguishable from the Nun, I
    have counted fifteen, and have heard of other such instances. On
    the other hand, Mr. Brent possessed a Dragon, which during its
    whole life never had more than ten tail-feathers; and one of my
    Dragons, descended from Mr. Brent's, had only eleven. I have seen a
    Bald-head Tumbler with only ten; and Mr. Brent had an Air-Tumbler
    with the same number, but another with fourteen tail-feathers. Two
    of these latter Tumblers, bred by Mr. Brent, were
    remarkable,&#8212;one from having the two central tail-feathers a
    little divergent, and the other from having the two outer feathers
    longer by three-eighths of an inch than the others; so that in both
    cases the tail exhibited a tendency, but in different ways, to
    become forked. And this shows us how a swallow-tailed breed, like
    that described by Bechstein, might have been formed by careful
    selection.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the primary
    wing-feathers, the number in the Columbid&#230;, as far as I can
    find out, is always nine or ten. In the rock-pigeon it is ten; but
    I have seen no less than eight short-faced Tumblers with only nine
    primaries, and the occurrence of this number has been noticed by
    fanciers, owing to ten primaries of a white colour being one of the
    points in Short-faced Bald-head-Tumblers. Mr. Brent, however, had
    an Air-Tumbler (not short-faced) which had in both wings eleven
    primaries. Mr. Corker, the eminent breeder of prize Carriers,
    assures me that some of his birds had eleven primaries in both
    wings. I have seen eleven in one wing in two Pouters. I have been
    assured by three fanciers that they have seen twelve in
    Scanderoons; but as Neumeister asserts that in the allied Florence
    Runt the middle flight-feather is often double, the number twelve
    may have been caused by two of the ten primaries having each two
    shafts to a single feather. The secondary wing-feathers are
    difficult to count, but the number seems to vary from twelve to
    fifteen. The length of the wing and tail relatively to the body,
    and of the wings to the tail, certainly varies; I have especially
    noticed this in Jacobins. In Mr. Bult's magnificent collection of
    Pouters, the wings and tail varied greatly in length; and were
    sometimes so much elongated that the birds could hardly play
    upright. In the relative length of the few first primaries I have
    observed only a slight degree of variability. Mr. Brent informs me
    that he has observed the shape of the first feather to vary very
    slightly. But the variation in these latter points is extremely
    slight compared with the differences which may be observed in the
    natural species of the Columbid&#230;.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the beak I have seen very considerable
    differences in birds of the same breed, as in carefully bred
    Jacobins and Trumpeters. In Carriers there is often a conspicuous
    difference in the degree of attenuation and curvature of the beak.
    So it is indeed in many breeds: thus I had two strains of black
    Barbs, which evidently differed in the curvature of the upper
    mandible. In width of mouth I have found a great difference in two
    Swallows. In Fantails of first-rate merit I have seen some birds
    with much longer and thinner necks than in others. Other analogous
    facts could be given. We have seen that the oil-gland is aborted in
    all Fantails (with the exception of the sub-race from Java), and, I
    may add, so hereditary is this tendency to abortion, that some,
    although not all, of the mongrels which I reared from the Fantail
    and Pouter had no oil-gland; in one Swallow out of many which I
    have examined, and in two Nuns, there was no oil-gland.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The number of the scutell&#230; on the
    toes often varies in the same breed, and sometimes even differs on
    the two feet of the same individual; the Shetland rock-pigeon has
    fifteen on the middle, and six on the hinder toe; whereas I have
    seen a Runt with sixteen on the middle and eight on the hind toe;
    and a short-faced Tumbler with only twelve and five on these same
    toes. The rock-pigeon has no sensible amount of skin between its
    toes; but I possessed a Spot and a Nun with the skin extending for
    a space of a quarter of an inch from the fork, between the two <I>
    inner</I> toes. On the other hand, as will hereafter be more fully
    shown, pigeons with feathered feet very generally have the bases of
    their <I>outer</I> toes connected by skin. I had a red Tumbler,
    which had a coo unlike that of its fellows, approaching in tone to
    that of the Laugher: this bird had the habit, to a degree which I
    never saw equalled in any other pigeon, of often walking with its
    wings raised and arched in an elegant-manner. I need say nothing on
    the great variability, in almost every breed, in size of body, in
    colour, in the feathering of the feet, and in the feathers on the
    back of the head being reversed. But I may mention a remarkable
    Tumbler<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> exhibited at the Crystal
    Palace, which had an irregular crest of feathers on its head,
    somewhat like the tuft on the head of the Polish fowl. Mr. Bult
    reared a hen Jacobin with the feathers on the thigh so long as to
    reach the ground, and a cock having, but in a lesser degree, the
    same peculiarity: from these two birds he bred others similarly
    characterised, which were exhibited at the Philoperisteron Soc. I
    bred a mongrel pigeon which had fibrous feathers, and the wing and
    tail-feathers so short and imperfect that the bird could not fly
    even a foot in height.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There are many singular and inherited
    peculiarities in the plumage of pigeons: thus Almond-Tumblers do
    not acquire their perfect mottled feathers until they have moulted
    three or four times: the Kite Tumbler is at first brindled black
    and red with a barred appearance, but when "it throws its nest
    feathers it becomes almost black, generally with a bluish tail, and
    a reddish colour on the inner webs of the primary wing-feathers."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> Neumeister describes a breed of a
    black colour with white bars on the wing and a white
    crescent-shaped mark on the breast; these marks are generally
    rusty-red before the first moult, but after the third or fourth
    moult they undergo a change; the wing-feathers and the crown of the
    head likewise then become white or grey.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is an important fact, and I believe there is
    hardly an exception to the rule, that the especial characters for
    which each breed is valued are eminently variable: thus, in the
    Fantail, the number and direction of the tail-feathers, the
    carriage of the body, and the degree of trembling are all highly
    variable points; in Pouters, the degree to which they pout, and the
    shape of their inflated crops; in the Carrier, the length,
    narrowness, and curvature of the beak, and the amount of wattle; in
    Short-faced Tumblers, the shortness of the beak, the prominence of
    the forehead, and general carriage,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> and in the Almond-Tumbler the colour of
    the plumage; in common Tumblers, the manner of tumbling; in the
    Barb, the breadth and shortness of the beak and the amount of
    eye-wattle; in Runts, the size of body; in Turbits the frill; and
    lastly in Trumpeters, the cooing, as well as the size of the tuft
    of feathers over the nostrils. These, which are the distinctive and
    selected characters of the several breeds, are all eminently
    variable.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">There is another interesting fact with respect
    to the characters of the several breeds, namely, that they are
    often most strongly displayed in the male bird. In Carriers, when
    the males and females are exhibited in separate pens, the wattle is
    plainly seen to be much more developed in the males, though I have
    seen a hen Carrier belonging to Mr. Haynes heavily wattled. Mr.
    Tegetmeier informs me that, in twenty Barbs in Mr. P. H. Jones's
    possession, the males had generally the largest eye-wattles; Mr.
    Esquilant also believes in this rule, but Mr. H. Weir, a first-rate
    judge, entertains some doubt on the subject. Male Pouters distend
    their crops to a much greater size than do the females; I have,
    however, seen a hen in the possession of Mr. Evans which pouted
    excellently; but this is an unusual circumstance. Mr. Harrison
    Weir, a successful breeder of prize Fantails, informs me that his
    male birds often have a greater number of tail-feathers than the
    females. Mr. Eaton asserts<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> that
    if a cock and hen Tumbler were of equal merit, the hen would be
    worth double the money; and as pigeons always pair, so that an
    equal number of both sexes is necessary for reproduction, this
    seems to show that high merit is rarer in the female than in the
    male. In the development of the frill in Turbits, of the hood in
    Jacobins, of the tuft in Trumpeters, of tumbling in Tumblers, there
    is no difference between the males and females. I may here add a
    rather different case, namely, the existence in France<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> of a wine-coloured variety of the
    Pouter, in which the male is generally chequered with black, whilst
    the female is never so chequered. Dr. Chapuis also remarks<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> that in certain light-coloured pigeons
    the males have their feathers striated with black, and these
    stri&#230; increase in size at each moult, so that the male
    ultimately becomes spotted with black. With Carriers, the wattle,
    both on the beak and round the eyes, and with Barbs that round the
    eyes, goes on increasing with age. This augmentation of character
    with advancing age, and more especially the difference between the
    males and females in the above-mentioned several respects, are
    remarkable facts, for there is no sensible difference at any age
    between the two sexes in the aboriginal rock-pigeon; and not often
    any strongly marked difference throughout the family of the
    Columbid&#230;.<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the skeletons of the various breeds there is
    much variability; and though certain differences occur frequently,
    and others rarely, in certain breeds, yet none can be said to be
    absolutely characteristic of any breed. Considering that
    strongly-marked domestic races have been formed chiefly by man's
    selection, we ought not to expect to find great and constant
    differences in the skeleton; for fanciers neither see, nor do they
    care for, modifications of structure in the internal framework. Nor
    ought we to expect changes in the skeletons from changed habits of
    life; as every facility is given to the most distinct breeds to
    follow the same habits, and the much modified races are never
    allowed to wander abroad and procure their own food in various
    ways. Moreover, I find, on comparing the skeletons of <I>Columba
    livia, oenas, palumbus,</I> and <I>turtur</I>, which are ranked by
    all systematists in two or three distinct though allied genera,
    that the differences are extremely slight, certainly less than
    between the skeletons of some of the most distinct domestic breeds.
    How far the skeleton of the wild rock-pigeon is constant I have had
    no means of judging, as I have examined only two.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Skull.</I>&#8212;The individual bones,
    especially those at the base, do not differ in shape. But the whole
    skull, in its proportions, outline, and relative direction of the
    bones, differs greatly in some of the breeds, as may be seen by
    comparing the figures of (A) the wild rock-pigeon, (B) the
    Short-faced Tumbler, (C) the English Carrier, and (D) the
    Bagadotten Carrier (of Neumeister), all drawn of the natural size
    and viewed laterally. In the Carrier, besides the elongation of the
    bones of the face, the space between the orbits is proportionally a
    little narrower than in the rock-pigeon. In the Bagadotten the
    upper mandible is remarkably arched, and the premaxillary bones are
    proportionally broader. In the Short-faced Tumbler the skull is
    more globular: all the bones of the face are much shortened, and
    the front of the skull and descending nasal bones are almost
    perpendicular: the maxillo-jugal arch and premaxillary bones form
    an almost straight line; the space between the prominent edges of
    the eye-orbits is depressed. In the Barb the premaxillary bones are
    much shortened, and their anterior portion is thicker than in the
    rock-pigeon, as is the lower part of the nasal bone. In two Nuns
    the ascending branches of the premaxillaries, near their tips, were
    somewhat attenuated, and in these birds, as well as in some others,
    for instance in the Spot, the occipital crest over the foramen was
    considerably more prominent than in the rock-pigeon.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the lower jaw, the articular surface
    is proportionably smaller in many breeds than in the rock-pigeon;
    and the vertical diameter, more especially of the outer part of the
    articular surface, is considerably shorter. May not this be
    accounted for by the lessened use of the jaws, owing to nutritious
    food having been given during a long period to all highly improved
    pigeons? In Runts, Carriers, and Barbs (and in a lesser degree in
    several breeds), the whole side of the jaw near the articular end
    is bent inwards in a highly remarkable manner; and the superior
    margin of the ramus, beyond the middle, is reflexed in an equally
    remarkable manner, as may be seen in fig. 25, in comparison with
    the jaw of the rock-pigeon. This reflection of the upper margin of
    the lower jaw is plainly connected with the singularly wide gape of
    the mouth, as has been described in Runts, Carriers, and Barbs. The
    reflection is well shown in fig. 26 of the head of a Runt seen from
    above; here a wide open space may be observed on each side, between
    the edges of the lower jaw and of the premaxillary bones. In the
    rock-pigeon, and in several domestic breeds, the edges of the lower
    jaw on each side come close up to the premaxillary bones, so that
    no open space is left. The degree of downward curvature of the
    distal half of the lower jaw also differs to an extraordinary
    degree in some breeds, as may be seen in the drawings (fig. 27 A)
    of the rock-pigeon, (B) of the Short-faced Tumbler, and (C) of the
    Bagadotten Carrier of Neumeister. In some Runts the symphysis of
    the lower jaw is remarkably solid. No one would readily have
    believed that jaws differing in the several above-specified points
    so greatly could have belonged to the same species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Vertebr&#230;.</I>&#8212;All the
    breeds have twelve cervical vertebr&#230;.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> But in a Bussorah Carrier from India the
    twelfth vertebra carried a small rib, a quarter of an inch in
    length, with a perfect double articulation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The <I>dorsal vertebr&#230;</I> are
    always eight. In the rock-pigeon all eight bear ribs; the eighth
    rib being very thin, and the seventh having no process. In Pouters
    all the ribs are extremely broad, eight bear ribs; the eighth rib
    being very thin and the seventh having no process. In Pouters all
    the ribs are extremely broad, and, in three out of four skeletons
    examined by me, the eighth rib was twice or even thrice as broad as
    in the rock-pigeon; and the seventh pair had distinct processes. In
    many breeds there are only seven ribs, as in seven out of eight
    skeletons of various Tumblers, and in several skeletons of
    Fantails, Turbits and Nuns.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In all these breeds the seventh pair was
    very small, and was destitute of processes, in which respect it
    differed from the same rib in the rock-pigeon. In one Tumbler, and
    in the Bussorah Carrier, even the sixth pair had no process. The
    hypapophysis of the second dorsal vertebra varies much in
    development; being sometimes (as in several, but not all Tumblers)
    nearly as prominent as that of the third dorsal vertebra; and the
    two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified arch. The
    development of the arch, formed by the hypapophyses of the third
    and fourth dorsal vertebr&#230;, also varies considerably, as does
    the size of the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The rock-pigeon has twelve sacral vertebr&#230;;
    but these vary in number, relative size, and distinctness, in the
    different breeds. In Pouters, with their elongated bodies, there
    are thirteen or even fourteen, and, as we shall immediately see, an
    additional number of caudal vertebr&#230;. In Runts and Carriers
    there is generally the proper number, namely twelve; but in one
    Runt, and in the Bussorah Carrier, there were only eleven. In
    Tumblers there are either eleven, or twelve, or thirteen sacral
    vertebr&#230;.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The <I>caudal vertebr&#230;</I> are seven in
    number in the rock-pigeon. In Fantails, which have their tails so
    largely developed, there are eight or nine, and apparently in one
    case ten, and they are a little longer than in the rock-pigeon, and
    their shape varies considerably. Pouters, also, have eight or nine
    caudal vertebr&#230;. I have seen eight in a Nun and Jacobin.
    Tumblers, though such small birds, always have the normal number
    seven; as have Carriers, with one exception, in which there were
    only six.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The <I>pelvis</I> differs very little in any
    breed. The anterior margin of the ilium, however, is sometimes a
    little more equally rounded on both sides than in the rock-pigeon.
    The ischium is also frequently rather more elongated. The
    obturator-notch is sometimes, as in many Tumblers, less developed
    than in the rock-pigeon. The ridges on the ilium are very prominent

    "108" height="527" align="RIGHT">

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the bones of the extremities I could
    detect no difference, except in their proportional lengths; for
    instance, the metatarsus in a Pouter was 1&#183;65 inch, and in a
    Short-faced Tumbler only &#183;95 in length; and this is a greater
    difference than would naturally follow from their differently-sized
    bodies; but long legs in the Pouter, and small feet in the Tumbler,
    are selected points. In some Pouters the <I>scapula</I> is rather
    straighter, and in some Tumblers it is straighter, with the apex
    less elongated, than in the rock-pigeon: in fig. 28, the scapula of
    the rock-pigeon (A), and of a short-faced Tumbler (B), are given.
    The processes at the summit of the <I>coracoid,</I> which receive
    the extremities of the furculum, form a more perfect cavity in some
    Tumblers than in the rock-pigeon: in Pouters these processes are
    larger and differently shaped, and the exterior angle of the
    extremity of the coracoid, which is articulated to the sternum, is
    squarer.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The two arms of the <I>furculum</I> in
    Pouters diverge less, proportionally to their length, than in the
    rock-pigeon; and the symphysis is more solid and pointed. In
    Fantails the degree of divergence of the two arms varies in a
    remarkable manner. In fig. 29, B and C represent the furcula of two
    Fantails; and it will be seen that the divergence in B is rather
    less even than in the furculum of the short-faced, small-sized
    Tumbler (A), whereas the divergence in C equals that in a
    rock-pigeon, or in the Pouter (D), though the latter is a much
    larger bird. The extremities of the furculum, where articulated to
    the coracoids, vary considerably in outline.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the <I>sternum</I> the differences in
    form are slight, except in the size and outline of the
    perforations, which, both in the larger and lesser sized breeds,
    are sometimes small. These perforations, also, are sometimes either
    nearly circular, or elongated as is often the case with Carriers.
    The posterior perforations occasionally are not complete, being
    left open posteriorly. The marginal apophyses forming the anterior
    perforations vary greatly in development. The degree of convexity
    of the posterior part of the sternum differs much, being sometimes
    almost perfectly flat. The manubrium is rather more prominent in
    some individuals than in others, and the pore immediately under it
    varies greatly in size.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Correlation of Growth.</I>&#8212;By this term
    I mean that the whole organisation is so connected, that when one
    part varies, other parts vary; but which of two correlated
    variations ought to be looked at as the cause and which as the
    effect, or whether both result from some common cause, we can
    seldom or never tell. The point of interest for us is that, when
    fanciers, by the continued selection of slight variations, have
    largely modified one part, they often unintentionally produce other
    modifications. For instance, the beak is readily acted on by
    selection, and, with its increased or diminished length, the tongue
    increases or diminishes, but not in due proportion; for, in a Barb
    and Short-faced Tumbler, both of which have very short beaks, the
    tongue, taking the rock-pigeon as the standard of comparison, was
    proportionally not shortened enough, whilst in two Carriers and in
    a Runt the tongue, proportionally with the beak, was not lengthened
    enough, thus, in a first-rate English Carrier, in which the beak
    from the tip to the feathered base was exactly thrice as long as in
    a first-rate Short-faced Tumbler, the tongue was only a little more
    than twice as long. But the tongue varies in length independently
    of the beak: thus in a Carrier with a beak 1&#183;2 inch in length,
    the tongue was &#183;67 in length: whilst in a Runt which equalled
    the Carrier in length of body and in stretch of wings from tip to
    tip, the beak was &#183;92 whilst the tongue was &#183;73 of an
    inch in length, so that the tongue was actually longer than in the
    carrier with its long beak. The tongue of the Runt was also very
    broad at the root. Of two Runts, one had its beak longer by
    &#183;23 of an inch, whilst its tongue was shorter by &#183;14 than
    in the other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With the increased or diminished length of the
    beak the length of the slit forming the external orifice of the
    nostrils varies, but not in due proportion, for, taking the
    rock-pigeon as the standard, the orifice in a Short-faced Tumbler
    was not shortened in due proportion with its very short beak. On
    the other hand (and this could not have been anticipated), the
    orifice in three English Carriers, in the Bagadotten Carrier, and
    in a Runt (<I>pigeon cygne</I>), was longer by above the tenth of
    an inch than would follow from the length of the beak
    proportionally with that of the rock-pigeon. In one Carrier the
    orifice of the nostrils was thrice as long as in the rock-pigeon,
    though in body and length of beak this bird was not nearly double
    the size of the rock-pigeon. This greatly increased length of the
    orifice of the nostrils seems to stand partly in correlation with
    the enlargement of the wattled skin on the upper mandible and over
    the nostrils; and this is a character which is selected by
    fanciers. So again, the broad, naked, and wattled skin round the
    eyes of Carriers and Barbs is a selected character; and in obvious
    correlation with this, the eyelids, measured longitudinally, are
    proportionally more than double the length of those of the
    rock-pigeon.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The great difference (see fig. 27) in the
    curvature of the lower jaw in the rock-pigeon, the Tumbler, and
    Bagadotten Carrier, stands in obvious relation to the curvature of
    the upper jaw, and more especially to the angle formed by the
    maxillo-jugal arch with the premaxillary bones. But in Carriers,
    Runts, and Barbs the singular reflexion of the upper margin of the
    middle part of the lower jaw (see fig. 25) is not strictly
    correlated with the width or divergence (as may be clearly seen in
    fig. 26) of the premaxillary bones, but with the breadth of the
    horny and soft parts of the upper mandible, which are always
    overlapped by the edges of the lower mandible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In Pouters, the elongation of the body is a
    selected character, and the ribs, as we have seen, have generally
    become very broad, with the seventh pair furnished with processes;
    the sacral and caudal vertebr&#230; have been augmented in number;
    the sternum has likewise increased in length (but not in the depth
    of the crest) by &#183;4 of an inch more than would follow from the
    greater bulk of the body in comparison with that of the
    rock-pigeon. In Fantails, the length and number of the caudal
    vertebr&#230; have increased. Hence, during the gradual progress of
    variation and selection, the internal bony framework and the
    external shape of the body have been, to a certain extent, modified
    in a correlated manner.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although the wings and tail often vary in length
    independently of each other, it is scarcely possible to doubt that
    they generally tend to become elongated or shortened in
    correlation. This is well seen in Jacobins, and still more plainly
    in Runts, some varieties of which have their wings and tail of
    great length, whilst others have both very short. With Jacobins,
    the remarkable length of the tail and wing-feathers is not a
    character which is intentionally selected by fanciers; but fanciers
    have been trying for centuries, at least since the year 1600, to
    increase the length of the reversed feathers on the neck, so that
    the hood may more completely enclose the head; and it may be
    suspected that the increased length of the wing and tail-feathers
    stand in correlation with the increased length of the
    neck-feathers. Short-faced Tumblers have short wings in nearly due
    proportion with the reduced size of their bodies; but it is
    remarkable, seeing that the number of the primary wing-feathers is
    a constant character in most birds, that these Tumblers generally
    have only nine instead of ten primaries. I have myself observed
    this in eight birds; and the Original Columbarian Society<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> reduced the standard for Bald-head
    Tumblers from ten to nine white flight-feathers, thinking it unfair
    that a bird which had only nine feathers should be disqualified for
    a prize because it had not ten <I>white</I> flight-feathers. On the
    other hand, in Carriers and Runts, which have large bodies and long
    wings, eleven primary feathers have occasionally been observed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Tegetmeier has informed me of a curious and
    inexplicable case of correlation, namely, that young pigeons of all
    breeds which when mature become white, yellow, silver (<I>i.e.,</I>
    extremely pale blue), or dun-coloured, are born almost naked;
    whereas pigeons of other colours are born well-clothed with down.
    Mr. Esquilant, however, has observed that young dun Carriers are
    not so bare as young dun Barbs and Tumblers. Mr. Tegetmeier has
    seen two young birds in the same nest, produced from differently
    coloured parents, which differed greatly in the degree to which
    they were at first clothed with down.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have observed another case of correlation
    which at first sight appears quite inexplicable, but on which, as
    we shall see in a future chapter, some light can be thrown by the
    law of homologous parts varying in the same manner. The case is,
    that, when the feet are much feathered, the roots of the feathers
    are connected by a web of skin, and apparently in correlation with
    this the two outer toes become connected for a considerable space
    by skin. I have observed this in very many specimens of Pouters,
    Trumpeters, Swallows, Roller-tumblers (likewise observed in this
    breed by Mr. Brent), and in a lesser degree in other feather-footed
    pigeons.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The feet of the smaller and larger breeds are of
    course much smaller or larger than those of the rock-pigeon; but
    the scutell&#230; or scales covering the toes and tarsi have not
    only decreased or increased in size, but likewise in number. To
    give a single instance, I have counted eight scutell&#230; on the
    hind toe of a Runt, and only five on that of a Short-faced Tumbler.
    With birds in a state of nature the number of the scutell&#230; on
    the feet is usually a constant character. The length of the feet
    and the length of the beak apparently stand in correlation; but as
    disuse apparently has affected the size of the feet, this case may
    come under the following discussion.</P>

    following discussion on the relative proportions of the feet,
    sternum, furculum, scapul&#230;, and wings, I may premise, in order
    to give some confidence to the reader, that all my measurements
    were made in the same manner, and that they were made without the
    least intention of applying them to the following purpose.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I measured most of the birds which came
    into my possession, from the feathered <I>base</I> of the beak (the
    length of beak itself being so variable) to the end of the tail,
    and to the oil-gland, but unfortunately (except in a few cases) not
    to the root of the tail; I measured each bird from the extreme tip
    to tip of wing; and the length of the terminal folded part of the
    wing, from the extremity of the primaries to the joint of the
    radius. I measured the feet without the claws, from the end of the
    middle toe to the end of the hind toe; and the tarsus and middle
    toe together. I have taken in every case the mean measurement of
    two wild rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands, as the standard of
    comparison. The following table shows the actual length of the feet
    in each bird; and the difference between the length which the feet
    ought to have had according to the size of body of each, in
    comparison with the size of body and length of feet of the
    rock-pigeon, calculated (with a few specified exceptions) by the
    standard of the length of the body from the base of the beak to the
    oil-gland. I have preferred this standard, owing to the variability
    of the length of tail. But I have made similar calculations, taking
    as the standard the length from tip to tip of wing, and likewise in
    most cases from the base of the beak to the end of the tail; and
    the result has always been closely similar. To give an example: the
    first bird in the table, being a Short-faced Tumbler, is much
    smaller than the rock-pigeon, and would naturally have shorter
    feet; but it is found on calculation to have feet too short by
    &#183;11 of an inch, in comparison with the feet of the
    rock-pigeon, relatively to the size of the body in these two birds,
    as measured from the base of beak to the oil-gland. So again, when
    this same Tumbler and the rock-pigeon were compared by the length
    of their wings, or by the extreme length of their bodies, the feet
    of the Tumbler were likewise found to be too short in very nearly
    the same proportion. I am well aware that the measurements pretend
    to greater accuracy than is possible, but it was less trouble to
    write down the actual measurements given by the compasses in each
    case than an approximation.</SMALL></P>

    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In these two tables (Tables I and II) we
    see in the first column the actual length of the feet in thirty-six
    birds belonging to various breeds, and in the two other columns we
    see by how much the feet are too short or too long, according to
    the size of bird, in comparison with the rock-pigeon. In the first
    table twenty-two specimens have their feet too short, on an average
    by a little above the tenth of an inch (viz. &#183;107); and five
    specimens have their feet on an average a very little too long,
    namely, by &#183;07 of an inch. But some of these latter cases can
    be explained; for instance, with Pouters the legs and feet are
    selected for length, and thus any natural tendency to a diminution
    in the length of the feet will have been counteracted. In the
    Swallow and Barb, when the calculation was made on any standard of
    comparison besides the one used (viz. length of body from base of
    beak to oil-gland), the feet were found to be too
    small.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the second table we have eight birds,
    with their beaks much longer than in the rock-pigeon, both actually
    and proportionally with the size of body, and their feet are in an
    equally marked manner longer, namely, in proportion, on an average
    by &#183;29 of an inch. I should here state that in Table I there
    are a few partial exceptions to the beak being proportionally
    shorter than in the rock-pigeon: thus the beak of the English
    Frill-back is just perceptibly longer, and that of the Bussorah
    Carrier of the same length or slightly longer, than in the
    rock-pigeon. The beaks of Spots, Swallows, and Laughers are only a
    very little shorter, or of the same proportional length, but
    slenderer. Nevertheless, these two tables, taken conjointly,
    indicate pretty plainly some kind of correlation between the length
    of the beak and the size of the feet. Breeders of cattle and horses
    believe that there is an analogous connection between the length of
    the limbs and head; they assert that a race-horse with the head of
    a dray-horse, or a grey-hound with the head of a bulldog, would be
    a monstrous production. As fancy pigeons are generally kept in
    small aviaries, and are abundantly supplied with food, they must
    walk about much less than the wild rock-pigeon; and it may be
    admitted as highly probable that the reduction in the size of the
    feet in the twenty-two birds in the first table has been caused by
    disuse,<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> and that this reduction
    has acted by correlation on the beaks of the great majority of the
    birds in Table I. When, on the other hand, the beak has been much
    elongated by the continued selection of successive slight
    increments of length, the feet by correlation have likewise become
    much elongated in comparison with those of the wild rock-pigeon,
    notwithstanding their lessened use.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As I had taken measures from the end of
    the middle toe to the heel of the tarsus in the rock-pigeon and in
    the above thirty-six birds, I have made calculations analogous with
    those above given, and the result is the same&#8212; namely, that
    in the short-beaked breeds, with equally few exceptions as in the
    former case, the middle toe conjointly with the tarsus has
    decreased in length; whereas in the long-beaked breeds it has
    increased in length, though not quite so uniformly as in the former
    case, for the leg, in some varieties of the Runt varies much in
    length.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As fancy pigeons are generally confined
    in aviaries of moderate size, and as even when not confined they do
    not search for their own food, they must during many generations
    have used their wings incomparably less than the wild rock-pigeon.
    Hence it seemed to me probable that all the parts of the skeleton
    subservient to flight would be found to be reduced in size. With
    respect to the sternum, I have carefully measured its extreme
    length in twelve birds of different breeds, and in two wild
    rock-pigeons from the Shetland Islands. For the proportional
    comparison I have tried three standards of measurement, with all
    twelve birds namely, the length from the base of the beak to the
    oil-gland, to the end of the tail, and from the extreme tip to tip
    of wings. The result has been in each case nearly the same, the
    sternum being invariably found to be shorter than in the wild
    rock-pigeon. I will give only a single table, as calculated by the
    standard from the base of the beak to the oil-gland; for the result
    in this case is nearly the mean between the results obtained by the
    two other standards.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This table shows that in these twelve
    breeds the sternum is of an average one-third of an inch (exactly
    &#183;332) shorter than in the rock-pigeon, proportionally with the
    size of their bodies; so that the sternum has been reduced by
    between one-seventh and one-eighth of its entire length; and this
    is a considerable reduction.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have also measured in twenty-one birds,
    including the above dozen, the prominence of the crest of the
    sternum relatively to its length, independently of the size of the
    body. In two of the twenty-one birds the crest was prominent in the
    same relative degree as in the rock-pigeon; in seven it was more
    prominent; but in five out of these seven, namely, in a Fantail,
    two Scanderoons, and two English Carriers, this greater prominence
    may to a certain extent be explained, as a prominent breast is
    admired and selected by fanciers; in the remaining twelve birds the
    prominence was less. Hence it follows that the crest exhibits a
    slight, though uncertain, tendency to be reduced in prominence in a
    greater degree than does the length of the sternum relatively to
    the size of body, in comparison with the rock-pigeon.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I have measured the length of the scapula
    in nine different large and small-sized breeds, and in all the
    scapula is proportionally shorter (taking the same standard as
    before) than in the wild rock-pigeon. The reduction in length on an
    average is very nearly one-fifth of an inch, or about one-ninth of
    the length of the scapula in the rock-pigeon.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The arms of the furcula in all the
    specimens which I compared, diverged less, proportionally with the
    size of body, than in the rock-pigeon; and the whole furculum was
    proportionally shorter. Thus in a Runt, which measured from tip to
    tip of wings 38&#189; inches, the furculum was only a very little
    longer (with the arms hardly more divergent) than in a rock-pigeon
    which measured from tip to tip 26&#189; inches. In a Barb, which in
    all its measurements was a little larger than the same rock-pigeon,
    the furculum was a quarter of an inch shorter. In a Pouter, the
    furculum had not been lengthened proportionally with the increased
    length of the body. In a Short-faced Tumbler, which measured from
    tip to tip of wings 24 inches, therefore only 2&#189; inches less
    than the rock-pigeon, the furculum was barely two-thirds of the
    length of that of the rock-pigeon.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We thus clearly see that the sternum, scapula,
    and furculum are all reduced in proportional length; but when we
    turn to the wings we find what at first appears a wholly different
    and unexpected result. I may here remark that I have not picked out
    specimens, but have used every measurement made by me. Taking the
    length from the base of beak to the end of the tail as the standard
    of comparison, I find that, out of thirty-five birds of various
    breeds, twenty-five have wings of greater, and ten have them of
    less proportional length, than in the rock-pigeon. But from the
    frequently correlated length of the tail and wing-feathers, it is
    better to take as the standard of comparison the length from the
    base of the beak to the oil-gland; and by this standard, out of
    twenty-six of the same birds which had been thus measured,
    twenty-one had wings too long, and only five had them too short. In
    the twenty-one birds the wings exceeded in length those of the
    rock-pigeon, on an average, by 1-1/3 inch; whilst in the five birds
    they were less in length by only &#183;8 of an inch. As I was much
    surprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so
    frequently have been increased in length, it occurred to me that it
    might be solely due to the greater length of the wing-feathers; for
    this certainly is the case with the Jacobin, which has wings of
    unusual length. As in almost every case I had measured the folded
    wings, I subtracted the length of this terminal part from that of
    the expanded wings, and thus I obtained, with a moderate degree of
    accuracy, the length of the wings from the ends of the two radii,
    answering from wrist to wrist in our arms. The wings, thus measured
    in the same twenty-five birds, now gave a widely different result;
    for they were proportionally with those of the rock-pigeon too
    short in seventeen birds, and in only eight too long. Of these
    eight birds, five were long-beaked,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> and this fact perhaps indicates that
    there is some correlation of the length of the beak with the length
    of the bones of the wings, in the same manner as with that of the
    feet and tarsi. The shortening of the humerus and radius in the
    seventeen birds may probably be attributed to disuse, as in the
    case of the scapula and furculum to which the wing-bones are
    attached;&#8212;the lengthening of the wing-feathers, and
    consequently the expansion of the wings from tip to tip, being, on
    the other hand, as completely independent of use and disuse as is
    the growth of the hair or wool on our long-haired dogs or
    long-woolled sheep.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To sum up: we may confidently admit that the
    length of the sternum, and frequently the prominence of its crest,
    the length of the scapula and furculum, have all been reduced in
    size in comparison with the same parts in the rock-pigeon. And I
    presume that this may be attributed to disuse or lessened exercise.
    The wings, as measured from the ends of the radii, have likewise
    been generally reduced in length; but, owing to the increased
    growth of the wing-feathers, the wings, from tip to tip, are
    commonly longer than in the rock-pigeon. The feet, as well as the
    tarsi conjointly with the middle toe, have likewise in most cases
    become reduced; and this it is probable has been caused by their
    lessened use; but the existence of some sort of correlation between
    the feet and beak is shown more plainly than the effects of disuse.
    We have also some faint indication of a similar correlation between
    the main bones of the wing and the beak.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Summary on the Points of Difference between
    the several Domestic Races, and between the individual
    Birds.</I>&#8212;The beak, together with the bones of the face,
    differ remarkably in length, breadth, shape, and curvature. The
    skull differs in shape, and greatly in the angle formed by the
    union of the pre-maxillary, nasal, and maxillo-jugal bones. The
    curvature of the lower jaw and the reflection of its upper margin,
    as well as the gape of the mouth, differ in a highly remarkable
    manner. The tongue varies much in length, both independently and in
    correlation with the length of the beak. The development of the
    naked, wattled skin over the nostrils and round the eyes varies in
    an extreme degree. The eyelids and the external orifices of the
    nostrils vary in length, and are to a certain extent correlated
    with the degree of development of the wattle. The size and form of
    the &#156;sophagus and crop, and their capacity for inflation,
    differ immensely. The length of the neck varies. With the varying
    shape of the body, the breadth and number of the ribs, the presence
    of processes, the number of the sacral vertebr&#230;, and the
    length of the sternum, all vary. The number and size of the
    coccygeal vertebr&#230; vary, apparently in correlation with the
    increased size of the tail. The size and shape of the perforations
    in the sternum, and the size and divergence of the arms of the
    furculum, differ. The oil-gland varies in development, and is
    sometimes quite aborted. The direction and length of certain
    feathers have been much modified, as in the hood of the Jacobin and
    the frill of the Turbit. The wing and tail-feathers generally vary
    in length together, but sometimes independently of each other and
    of the size of the body. The number and position of the
    tail-feather vary to an unparalleled degree. The primary and
    secondary wing-feathers occasionally vary in number, apparently in
    correlation with the length of the wing. The length of the leg and
    the size of the feet, and, in connection with the latter, the
    number of the scutell&#230;, all vary. A web of skin sometimes
    connects the bases of the two inner toes, and almost invariably the
    two outer toes when the feet are feathered.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The size of the body differs greatly: a Runt has
    been known to weigh more than five times as much as a Short-faced
    Tumbler. The eggs differ in size and shape. According to
    Parmentier,<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> some races use much
    straw in building their nests, and others use little; but I cannot
    hear of any recent corroboration of this statement. The length of
    time required for hatching the eggs is uniform in all the breeds.
    The period at which the characteristic plumage of some breeds is
    acquired, and at which certain changes of colour supervene,
    differs. The degree to which the young birds are clothed with down
    when first hatched is different, and is correlated in a singular
    manner with the colour of the plumage. The manner of flight, and
    certain inherited movements, such as clapping the wings, tumbling
    either in the air or on the ground, and the manner of courting the
    female, present the most singular differences. In disposition the
    several races differ. Some races are very silent; others coo in a
    highly peculiar manner.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although many different races have kept true in
    character during several centuries, as we shall hereafter more
    fully see, yet there is far more individual variability in the most
    constant breeds than in birds in a state of nature. There is hardly
    any exception to the rule that those characters vary most which are
    now most valued and attended to by fanciers, and which consequently
    are now being improved by continued selection. This is indirectly
    admitted by fanciers when they complain that it is much more
    difficult to breed high fancy pigeons up to the proper standard of
    excellence than the so-called toy pigeons, which differ from each
    other merely in colour; for particular colours when once acquired
    are not liable to continued improvement or augmentation. Some
    characters become attached, from quite unknown causes, more
    strongly to the male than to the female sex; so that we have in
    certain races, a tendency towards the appearance of secondary
    sexual characters,<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> of which the
    aboriginal rock-pigeon displays not a trace.</P>

      (in his 'Pterylographie,' 1840, p. 55) states that it is absent
      in two species of Columba, in several species of Psittacus, in
      some species of Otis, and in most or all birds of the Ostrich
      family. It can hardly be an accidental coincidence that the two
      species of Columba, which are destitute of an oil-gland, have an
      unusual number of tail-feathers, namely 16, and in this respect
      resemble Fantails.</FONT></LI>

      of the ease with which a race thus characterised could be

      and Runts. Barbs may properly be called short-beaked Carriers. It
      would, therefore, appear as if, during the reduction of their
