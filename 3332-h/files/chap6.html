    <P align="JUSTIFY">The differences described in the last chapter
    between the eleven chief domestic races and between individual
    birds of the same race, would be of little significance, if they
    had not all descended from a single wild stock. The question of
    their origin is therefore of fundamental importance, and must be
    discussed at considerable length. No one will think this
    superfluous who considers the great amount of difference between
    the races, who knows how ancient many of them are, and how truly
    they breed at the present day. Fanciers almost unanimously believe
    that the different races are descended from several wild stocks,
    whereas most naturalists believe that all are descended from the
    Columba livia or rock-pigeon.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Temminck <A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A>has
    well observed, and Mr. Gould has made the same remark to me, that
    the aboriginal parent must have been a species which roosted and
    built its nest on rocks; and I may add that it must have been a
    social bird. For all the domestic races are highly social, and none
    are known to build or habitually to roost on trees. The awkward
    manner in which some pigeons, kept by me in a summer-house near an
    old walnut-tree, occasionally alighted on the barer branches, was
    evident.<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> Nevertheless, Mr. R. Scot
    Skirving informs me that he often saw crowds of pigeons in Upper
    Egypt settling on low trees, but not on palms, in preference to
    alighting on the mud hovels of the natives. In India Mr. Blyth<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> has been assured that the wild <I>C.
    livia,</I> var. <I>intermedia,</I> sometimes roosts in trees. I may
    here give a curious instance of compulsion leading to changed
    habits: the banks of the Nile above lat. 28&#176; 30' are
    perpendicular for a long distance, so that when the river is full
    the pigeons cannot alight on the shore to drink, and Mr. Skirving
    repeatedly saw whole flocks settle on the water, and drink whilst
    they floated down the stream. These flocks seen from a distance
    resembled flocks of gulls on the surface of the sea.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If any domestic race had descended from a
    species which was not social, or which built its nest and roosted
    in trees,<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> the sharp eyes of
    fanciers would assuredly have detected some vestige of so different
    an aboriginal habit. For we have reason to believe that aboriginal
    habits are long retained under domestication. Thus with the common
    ass we see signs of its original desert life in its strong dislike
    to cross the smallest stream of water, and in its pleasure in
    rolling in the dust. The same strong dislike to cross a stream is
    common to the camel, which has been domesticated from a very
    ancient period. Young pigs, though so tame, sometimes squat when
    frightened, and thus try to conceal themselves even on an open and
    bare place. Young turkeys, and occasionally even young fowls, when
    the hen gives the danger-cry, run away and try to hide themselves,
    like young partridges or pheasants, in order that their mother may
    take flight, of which she has lost the power. The musk-duck
    (<I>Cairina moschata</I>) in its native country often perches and
    roosts on trees,<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> and our
    domesticated musk-ducks, though such sluggish birds, "are fond of
    perching on the tops of barns, walls, etc., and, if allowed to
    spend the night in the hen-house, the female will generally go to
    roost by the side of the hens, but the drake is too heavy to mount
    thither with ease."<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> We know that
    the dog, however well and regularly fed, often buries, like the
    fox, any superfluous food; and we see him turning round and round
    on a carpet, as if to trample down grass to form a bed; we see him
    on bare pavements scratching backwards as if to throw earth over
    his excrement, although, as I believe, this is never effected even
    where there is earth. In the delight with which lambs and kids
    crowd together and frisk on the smallest hillock, we see a vestige
    of their former alpine habits.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have therefore good reason to believe that
    all the domestic races of the pigeon are descended either from some
    one or from several species which both roosted and built their
    nests on rocks, and were social in disposition. As only five or six
    wild species have these habits, and make any near approach in
    structure to the domesticated pigeon, I will enumerate them.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Firstly, the <I>Columba leuconota</I>
    resembles certain domestic varieties in its plumage, with the one
    marked and never-failing difference of a white band which crosses
    the tail at some distance from the extremity. This species,
    moreover, inhabits the Himalaya, close to the limit of perpetual
    snow; and therefore, as Mr. Blyth has remarked, is not likely to
    have been the parent of our domestic breeds, which thrive in the
    hottest countries. Secondly, the <I>C. rupestris,</I> of Central
    Asia, which is intermediate<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
    between the <I>C. leuconota</I> and <I>livia</I>; but has nearly
    the same coloured tail as the former species. Thirdly, the <I>
    Columba littoralis</I> builds and roosts, according to Temminck, on
    rocks in the Malayan archipelago; it is white, excepting parts of
    the wing and the tip of the tail, which are black; its legs are
    livid-coloured, and this is a character not observed in any adult
    domestic pigeon; but I need not have mentioned this species or the
    closely-allied <I>C. luctuosa,</I> as they in fact belong to the
    genus Carpophaga. Fourthly, <I>Columba guinea,</I> which ranges
    from Guinea<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> to the Cape of Good
    Hope, and roosts either on trees or rocks, according to the nature
    of the country. This species belongs to the genus Strictoenas of
    Reichenbach, but is closely allied to Columba; it is to some extent
    coloured like certain domestic races, and has been said to be
    domesticated in Abyssinia; but Mr. Mansfield Parkyns, who collected
    the birds of that country and knows the species, informs me that
    this is a mistake. Moreover, the <I>C. guinea</I> is characterised
    by the feathers of the neck having peculiar notched tips,&#8212;a
    character not observed in any domestic race. Fifthly, the <I>
    Columba &#339;nas</I> of Europe, which roosts on trees, and builds
    its nest in holes, either in trees or the ground; this species, as
    far as external characters go, might be the parent of several
    domestic races; but, though it crosses readily with the true
    rock-pigeon, the offspring, as we shall presently see, are sterile
    hybrids, and of such sterility there is not a trace when the
    domestic races are intercrossed. It should also be observed that if
    we were to admit, against all probability, that any of the
    foregoing five or six species were the parents of some of our
    domestic pigeons, not the least light would be thrown on the chief
    differences between the eleven most strongly-marked
    races.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We now come to the best known
    rock-pigeon, the <I>Columba livia,</I> which is often designated in
    Europe pre-eminently as the Rock-pigeon, and which naturalists
    believe to be the parent of all the domesticated breeds. This bird
    agrees in every essential character with the breeds which have been
    only slightly modified. It differs from all other species in being
    of a slaty-blue colour, with two black bars on the wings, and with
    the croup (or loins) white. Occasionally birds are seen in Faroe
    and the Hebrides with the black bars replaced by two or three black
    spots; this form has been named by Brehm<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> <I>C. amali&#230;,</I> but this species
    has not been admitted as distinct by other ornithologists. Graba<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> even found a difference in the bars
    on the right and left wings of the same bird in Faroe. Another and
    rather more distinct form is either truly wild or has become feral
    on the cliffs of England and was doubtfully named by Mr. Blyth<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> as <I>C. affinis,</I> but is now no
    longer considered by him as a distinct species. <I>C. affinis</I>
    is rather smaller than the rock-pigeon of the Scottish islands, and
    has a very different appearance owing to the wing-coverts being
    chequered with black, with similar marks often extending over the
    back. The chequering consists of a large black spot on the two
    sides, but chiefly on the outer side, of each feather. The
    wing-bars in the true rock-pigeon and in the chequered variety are,
    in fact, due to similar though larger spots symmetrically crossing
    the secondary wing-feather and the larger coverts. Hence the
    chequering arises merely from an extension of these marks to other
    parts of the plumage. Chequered birds are not confined to the
    coasts of England; for they were found by Graba at Faroe; and W.
    Thompson<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> says that at Islay fully
    half the wild rock-pigeons were chequered. Colonel King, of Hythe,
    stocked his dovecot with young wild birds which he himself procured
    from nests at the Orkney Islands; and several specimens, kindly
    sent to me by him, were all plainly chequered. As we thus see that
    chequered birds occur mingled with the true rock-pigeon at three
    distinct sites, namely, Faroe, the Orkney Islands, and Islay, no
    importance can be attached to this natural variation in the
    plumage.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Prince C. L. Bonaparte,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> a great divider of species, enumerates,
    with a mark of interrogation, as distinct from <I>C. livia,</I> the
    <I>C. turricola</I> of Italy, the <I>C. rupestris</I> of Daouria,
    and the <I>C. schimperi</I> of Abyssinia; but these birds differ
    from <I>C. livia</I> in characters of the most trifling value. In
    the British Museum there is a chequered pigeon, probably the <I>C.
    schimperi</I> of Bonaparte, from Abyssinia. To these may be added
    the <I>C. gymnocyclus</I> of G. R. Gray from W. Africa, which is
    slightly more distinct, and has rather more naked skin round the
    eyes than the rock-pigeon; but from information given me by Dr.
    Daniell, it is doubtful whether this is a wild bird, for
    dovecot-pigeons (which I have examined) are kept on the coast of
    Guinea.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The wild rock-pigeon of India (<I>C.
    intermedia</I> of Strickland) has been more generally accepted as a
    distinct species. It differs chiefly in the croup being blue
    instead of snow-white; but as Mr. Blyth informs me, the tint
    varies, being sometimes albescent. When this form is domesticated
    chequered birds appear, just as occurs in Europe with the truly
    wild <I>C. livia.</I> Moreover we shall immediately have proof that
    the blue and white croup is a highly variable character; and
    Bechstein<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> asserts that with
    dovecot-pigeons in Germany this is the most variable of all the
    characters of the plumage. Hence it may be concluded that <I>C.
    intermedia</I> cannot be ranked as specifically distinct from <I>C.
    livia.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In Madeira there is a rock-pigeon which a
    few ornithologists have suspected to be distinct from <I>C.
    livia.</I> I have examined numerous specimens collected by Mr. E.
    V. Harcourt and Mr. Mason. They are rather smaller than the rock-
    pigeon from the Shetland Islands, and their beaks are plainly
    thinner, but the thickness of the beak varied in the several
    specimens. In plumage there is remarkable diversity; some specimens
    are identical in every feather (I speak after actual comparison)
    with the rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands; others are chequered,
    like <I>C. affinis</I> from the cliffs of England, but generally to
    a greater degree, being almost black over the whole back; others
    are identical with the so-called <I>C. intermedia</I> of India in
    the degree of blueness of the croup; whilst others have this part
    very pale or very dark blue, and are likewise chequered. So much
    variability raises a strong suspicion that these birds are domestic
    pigeons which have become feral.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From these facts it can hardly be doubted
    that <I>C. livia, affinis, intermedia,</I> and the forms marked
    with an interrogation by Bonaparte ought all to be included under a
    single species. But it is quite immaterial whether or not they are
    thus ranked, and whether some one of these forms or all are the
    progenitors of the various domestic kinds, as far as any light can
    thus be thrown on the differences between the more strongly-marked
    races. That common dovecot-pigeons, which are kept in various parts
    of the world, are descended from one or from several of the
    above-mentioned wild varieties of <I>C. livia,</I> no one who
    compares them will doubt. But before making a few remarks on
    dovecot-pigeons, it should be stated that the wild rock-pigeon has
    been found easy to tame in several countries. We have seen that
    Colonel King at Hythe stocked his dovecot more than twenty years
    ago with young wild birds taken at the Orkney Islands, and since
    then they have greatly multiplied. The accurate Macgillivray<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> asserts that he completely tamed a
    wild rock-pigeon in the Hebrides; and several accounts are on
    records of these pigeons having bred in dovecots in the Shetland
    Islands. In India, as Captain Hutton informs me, the wild
    rock-pigeon is easily tamed, and breeds readily with the domestic
    kind; and Mr. Blyth<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> asserts that
    wild birds come frequently to the dovecots and mingle freely with
    their inhabitants. In the ancient 'Ayeen Akbery' it is written
    that, if a few wild pigeons be taken, "they are speedily joined by
    a thousand others of their kind."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Dovecot-pigeons are those which are kept
    in dovecots in a semi- domesticated state; for no special care is
    taken of them, and they procure their own food, except during the
    severest weather. In England, and, judging from MM. Boitard and
    Corbi&#233;'s work, in France, the common dovecot- pigeon exactly
    resembles the chequered variety of <I>C. livia;</I> but I have seen
    dovecots brought from Yorkshire without any trace of chequering,
    like the wild rock-pigeon of the Shetland Islands. The chequered
    dovecots from the Orkney Islands, after having been domesticated by
    Colonel King for more than twenty years, differed slightly from
    each other in the darkness of their plumage and in the thickness of
    their beaks; the thinnest beak being rather thicker than the
    thickest one in the Madeira birds. In Germany, according to
    Bechstein, the common dovecot-pigeon is not chequered. In India
    they often become chequered, and sometimes pied with white; the
    croup also, as I am informed by Mr. Blyth, becomes nearly white. I
    have received from Sir. J. Brooke some dovecot-pigeons, which
    originally came from the S. Natunas Islands in the Malay
    Archipelago, and which had been crossed with the Singapore
    dovecots: they were small and the darkest variety was extremely
    like the dark chequered variety with a blue croup from Madeira; but
    the beak was not so thin, though decidedly thinner than in the
    rock- pigeon from the Shetland Islands. A dovecot-pigeon sent to me
    by Mr. Swinhoe from Foochow, in China, was likewise rather small,
    but differed in no other respect. I have also received through the
    kindness of Dr. Daniell, four living dovecot-pigeons from Sierra
    Leone,<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> these were fully as large
    as the Shetland rock-pigeon, with even bulkier bodies. In plumage
    some of them were identical with the Shetland rock pigeon, but with
    the metallic tints apparently rather more brilliant; others had a
    blue croup, and resembled the chequered variety of <I>C.
    intermedia</I> of India; and some were so much chequered as to be
    nearly black. In these four birds the beak differed slightly in
    length, but in all it was decidedly shorter, more massive, and
    stronger than in the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands, or
    in the English dovecot. When the beaks of these African pigeons
    were compared with the thinnest beaks of the wild Madeira
    specimens, the contrast was great; the former being fully one-third
    thicker in a vertical direction than the latter; so that any one at
    first would have felt inclined to rank these birds as specifically
    distinct; yet so perfectly graduated a series could be formed
    between the above-mentioned varieties, that it was obviously
    impossible to separate them.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To sum up: the wild <I>Columba livia,</I>
    including under this name <I>C. affinis, intermedia,</I> and the
    other still more closely-affined geographical races, has a vast
    range from the southern coast of Norway and the Faroe Islands to
    the shores of the Mediterranean, to Madeira and the Canary Islands,
    to Abyssinia, India, and Japan. It varies greatly in plumage, being
    in many places chequered with black, and having either a white or
    blue croup or loins; it varies also slightly in the size of the
    beak and body. Dovecot-pigeons, which no one disputes are descended
    from one or more of the above wild forms, present a similar but
    greater range of variation in plumage, in the size of body, and in
    the length and thickness of the beak. There seems to be some
    relation between the croup being blue or white, and the temperature
    of the country inhabited by both wild and dovecot pigeons; for
    nearly all the dovecot-pigeons in the northern parts of Europe have
    a white croup, like that of the wild European rock-pigeon; and
    nearly all the dovecot-pigeons of India have a blue croup like that
    of the wild <I>C. intermedia</I> of India. As in various countries
    the wild rock-pigeon has been found easy to tame, it seems
    extremely probable that the dovecot-pigeons throughout the world
    are the descendants of at least two and perhaps more wild stocks;
    but these, as we have just seen, cannot be ranked as specifically
    distinct.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the variation of <I>C.
    livia,</I> we may without fear of contradiction go one step
    further. Those pigeon-fanciers who believe that all the chief
    races, such as Carriers, Pouters, Fantails, etc., are descended
    from distinct aboriginal stocks, yet admit that the so-called
    toy-pigeons, which differ from the rock-pigeon in little except
    colour, are descended from this bird. By toy-pigeons are meant such
    birds as Spots, Nuns, Helmets, Swallows, Priests, Monks,
    Porcelains, Swabians, Archangels, Breasts, Shields, and others in
    Europe, and many others in India. It would indeed be as puerile to
    suppose that all these birds are descended from so many distinct
    wild stocks as to suppose this to be the case with the many
    varieties of the gooseberry, heartsease, or dahlia. Yet these kinds
    all breed true, and many of them include sub-varieties which
    likewise transmit their character truly. They differ greatly from
    each other and from the rock-pigeon in plumage, slightly in size
    and proportions of body, in size of feet, and in the length and
    thickness of their beaks. They differ from each other in these
    respects more than do dovecot-pigeons. Although we may safely admit
    that dovecot-pigeons, which vary slightly, and that toy- pigeons,
    which vary in a greater degree in accordance with their more
    highly-domesticated condition, are descended from <I>C. livia,</I>
    including under this name the above-enumerated wild geographical
    races; yet the question becomes far more difficult when we consider
    the eleven principal races, most of which have been profoundly
    modified. It can, however, be shown, by indirect evidence of a
    perfectly conclusive nature, that these principal races are not
    descended from so many wild stocks; and if this be once admitted,
    few will dispute that they are the descendants of <I>C. livia,</I>
    which agrees with them so closely in habits and in most characters,
    which varies in a state of nature, and which has certainly
    undergone a considerable amount of variation, as in the
    toy-pigeons. We shall moreover presently see how eminently
    favourable circumstances have been for a great amount of
    modification in the more carefully tended breeds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The reasons for concluding that the several
    principal races are not descended from so many aboriginal and
    unknown stocks may be grouped under the following six
    heads:&#8212;</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Firstly.</I>&#8212;If the eleven chief races
    have not arisen from the variation of some one species, together
    with its geographical races, they must be descended from several
    extremely distinct aboriginal species; for no amount of crossing
    between only six or seven wild forms could produce races so
    distinct as Pouters, Carriers, Runts, Fantails, Turbits,
    Short-faced Tumblers, Jacobins, and Trumpeters. How could crossing
    produce, for instance, a Pouter or a Fantail, unless the two
    supposed aboriginal parents possessed the remarkable characters of
    these breeds? I am aware that some naturalists, following Pallas,
    believe that crossing gives a strong tendency to variation,
    independently of the characters inherited from either parent. They
    believe that it would be easier to raise a Pouter or Fantail pigeon
    from crossing two distinct species, neither of which possessed the
    characters of these races, than from any single species. I can find
    few facts in support of this doctrine, and believe in it only to a
    limited degree; but in a future chapter I shall have to recur to
    this subject. For our present purpose the point is not material.
    The question which concerns us is, whether or not many new and
    important characters have arisen since man first domesticated the
    pigeon. On the ordinary view, variability is due to changed
    conditions of life; on the Pallasian doctrine, variability, or the
    appearance of new characters, is due to some mysterious effect from
    the crossing of two species, neither of which possesses the
    characters in question. In some few instances it is possible that
    well-marked races may have been formed by crossing; for instance, a
    Barb might perhaps be formed by a cross between a long-beaked
    Carrier, having large eye-wattles, and some short-beaked pigeon.
    That many races have been in some degree modified by crossing, and
    that certain varieties which are distinguished only by peculiar
    tints have arisen from crosses between differently-coloured
    varieties, is almost certain. On the doctrine, therefore, that the
    chief races owe their differences to their descent from distinct
    species, we must admit that at least eight or nine, or more
    probably a dozen species, all having the same habit of breeding and
    roosting on rocks and living in society, either now exist
    somewhere, or formerly existed, but have become extinct as wild
    birds. Considering how carefully wild pigeons have been collected
    throughout the world, and what conspicuous birds they are,
    especially when frequenting rocks, it is extremely improbable that
    eight or nine species, which were long ago domesticated and
    therefore must have inhabited some anciently known country, should
    still exist in the wild state and be unknown to ornithologists.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The hypothesis that such species formerly
    existed, but have become extinct, is in some slight degree more
    probable. But the extinction of so many species within the
    historical period is a bold hypothesis, seeing how little influence
    man has had in exterminating the common rock-pigeon, which agrees
    in all its habits of life with the domestic races. The <I>C.
    livia</I> now exists and flourishes on the small northern islands
    of Faroe, on many islands off the coast of Scotland, on Sardinia,
    and the shores of the Mediterranean, and in the centre of India.
    Fanciers have sometimes imagined that the several supposed
    parent-species were originally confined to small islands, and thus
    might readily have been exterminated; but the facts just given do
    not favour the probability of their extinction, even on small
    islands. Nor is it probable, from what is known of the distribution
    of birds, that the islands near Europe should have been inhabited
    by peculiar species of pigeons; and if we assume that distant
    oceanic islands were the homes of the supposed parent-species, we
    must remember that ancient voyages were tediously slow, and that
    ships were then ill-provided with fresh food, so that it would not
    have been easy to bring home living birds. I have said ancient
    voyages, for nearly all the races of the pigeon were known before
    the year 1600, so that the supposed wild species must have been
    captured and domesticated before that date.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Secondly.</I>&#8212;The doctrine that the
    chief domestic races are descended from several aboriginal species,
    implies that several species were formerly so thoroughly
    domesticated as to breed readily when confined. Although it is easy
    to tame most wild birds, experience shows us that it is difficult
    to get them to breed freely under confinement; although it must be
    owned that this is less difficult with pigeons than with most other
    birds. During the last two or three hundred years, many birds have
    been kept in aviaries, but hardly one has been added to our list of
    thoroughly reclaimed species: yet on the above doctrine we must
    admit that in ancient times nearly a dozen kinds of pigeons, now
    unknown in the wild state, were thoroughly domesticated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Thirdly.</I>&#8212;Most of our domesticated
    animals have run wild in various parts of the world; but birds,
    owing apparently to their partial loss of the power of flight, less
    often than quadrupeds. Nevertheless I have met with accounts
    showing that the common fowl has become feral in South America and
    perhaps in West Africa, and on several islands: the turkey was at
    one time almost feral on the banks of the Parana; and the
    Guinea-fowl has become perfectly wild at Ascension and in Jamaica.
    In this latter island the peacock, also, "has become a maroon
    bird." The common duck wanders from its home and becomes almost
    wild in Norfolk. Hybrids between the common and musk-duck which
    have become wild have been shot in North America, Belgium, and near
    the Caspian Sea. The goose is said to have run wild in La Plata.
    The common dovecot-pigeon has become wild at Juan Fernandez,
    Norfolk Island, Ascension, probably at Madeira, on the shores of
    Scotland, and, as is asserted, on the banks of the Hudson in North
    America.<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> But how different is the
    case, when we turn to the eleven chief domestic races of the
    pigeon, which are supposed by some authors to be descended from so
    many distinct species! no one has ever pretended that any one of
    these races has been found wild in any quarter of the world; yet
    they have been transported to all countries, and some of them must
    have been carried back to their native homes. On the view that all
    the races are the product of variation, we can understand why they
    have not become feral, for the great amount of modification which
    they have undergone shows how long and how thoroughly they have
    been domesticated; and this would unfit them for a wild life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Fourthly.</I>&#8212;If it be assumed that the
    characteristic differences between the various domestic races are
    due to descent from several aboriginal species, we must conclude
    that man chose for domestication in ancient times, either
    intentionally or by chance, a most abnormal set of pigeons; for
    that species resembling such birds as Pouters, Fantails, Carriers,
    Barbs, Short-faced Tumblers, Turbits, etc., would be in the highest
    degree abnormal, as compared with all the existing members of the
    great pigeon family, cannot be doubted. Thus we should have to
    believe that man not only formerly succeeded in thoroughly
    domesticating several highly abnormal species, but that these same
    species have since all become extinct, or are at least now unknown.
    This double accident is so extremely improbable that the assumed
    existence of so many abnormal species would require to be supported
    by the strongest evidence. On the other hand, if all the races are
    descended from <I>C. livia,</I> we can understand, as will
    hereafter be more fully explained, how any slight deviation in
    structure which first appeared would continually be augmented by
    the preservation of the most strongly marked individuals; and as
    the power of selection would be applied according to man's fancy,
    and not for the bird's own good, the accumulated amount of
    deviation would certainly be of an abnormal nature in comparison
    with the structure of pigeons living in a state of nature.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have already alluded to the remarkable fact
    that the characteristic differences between the chief domestic
    races are eminently variable; we see this plainly in the great
    difference in the number of the tail-feathers in the Fantail, in
    the development of the crop in Pouters, in the length of the beak
    in Tumblers, in the state of the wattle in Carriers, etc. If these
    characters are the result of successive variations added together
    by selection, we can understand why they should be so variable: for
    these are the very parts which have varied since the domestication
    of the pigeon, and therefore would be likely still to vary; these
    variations moreover have been recently, and are still being
    accumulated by man's selection; therefore they have not as yet
    become firmly fixed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Fifthly.</I>&#8212;All the domestic races
    pair readily together, and, what is equally important, their
    mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile. To ascertain this fact I
    made many experiments, which are given in the note below; and
    recently Mr. Tegetmeier has made similar experiments with the same
    result.<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> The accurate Neumeister
    asserts that when dovecots are crossed with pigeons of any other
    breed, the mongrels are extremely fertile and hardy.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> affirm, after their great experience,
    that the more distinct the breeds are which are crossed, the more
    productive are their mongrel offspring. I admit that the doctrine
    first broached by Pallas is highly probable, if not actually
    proved, namely, that closely allied species, which in a state of
    nature or when first captured would have been in some degree
    sterile if crossed, lose this sterility after a long course of
    domestication; yet when we consider the great difference between
    such races as Pouters, Carriers, Runts, Fantails, Turbits, Tumblers
    etc., the fact of their perfect, or even increased, fertility when
    intercrossed in the most complicated manner becomes a strong
    argument in favour of their having all descended from a single
    species. This argument is rendered much stronger when we hear (I
    append in a note<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> all the cases
    which I have collected) that hardly a single well-ascertained
    instance is known of hybrids between two true species of pigeons
    being fertile, <I>inter se,</I> or even when crossed with one of
    their pure parents.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Sixthly.</I>&#8212;Excluding certain
    important characteristic differences, the chief races agree most
    closely both with each other and with <I>C. livia</I> in all other
    respects. As previously observed, all are eminently sociable; all
    dislike to perch or roost, and refuse to build in trees; all lay
    two eggs, and this is not a universal rule with the Columbid&#230;;
    all, as far as I can hear, require the same time for hatching their
    eggs; all can endure the same great range of climate; all prefer
    the same food, and are passionately fond of salt; all exhibit (with
    the asserted exception of the Finnikin and Turner which do not
    differ much in any other character) the same peculiar gestures when
    courting the females; and all (with the exception of Trumpeters and
    Laughers, which likewise do not differ much in any other character)
    coo in the same peculiar manner, unlike the voice of any other wild
    pigeon. All the coloured breeds display the same peculiar metallic
    tints on the breast, a character far from general with pigeons.
    Each race presents nearly the same range of variation in colour;
    and in most of the races we have the same singular correlation
    between the development of down in the young and the future colour
    of plumage. All have the proportional length of their toes, and of
    their primary wing-feathers, nearly the same,&#8212;characters
    which are apt to differ in the several members of the
    Columbid&#230;. In those races which present some remarkable
    deviation of structure, such as in the tail of Fantails, crop of
    Pouters, beak of Carriers and Tumblers, etc., the other parts
    remain nearly unaltered. Now every naturalist will admit that it
    would be scarcely possible to pick out a dozen natural species in
    any family which should agree closely in habits and in general
    structure, and yet should differ greatly in a few characters alone.
    This fact is explicable through the doctrine of natural selection;
    for each successive modification of structure in each natural
    species is preserved, solely because it is of service; and such
    modifications when largely accumulated imply a great change in the
    habits of life, and this will almost certainly lead to other
    changes of structure throughout the whole organisation. On the
    other hand, if the several races of the pigeon have been produced
    by man through selection and variation, we can readily understand
    how it is that they should still all resemble each other in habits
    and in those many characters which man has not cared to modify,
    whilst they differ to so prodigious a degree in those parts which
    have struck his eye or pleased his fancy.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Besides the points above enumerated, in which
    all the domestic races resemble <I>C. livia</I> and each other,
    there is one which deserves special notice. The wild rock-pigeon is
    of a slaty-blue colour; the wings are crossed by two bars; the
    croup varies in colour, being generally white in the pigeon of
    Europe, and blue in that of India; the tail has a black bar close
    to the end, and the outer webs of the outer tail-feathers are edged
    with white, except near the tips. These combined characters are not
    found in any wild pigeon besides <I>C. livia.</I> I have looked
    carefully through the great collections of pigeons in the British
    Museum, and I find that a dark bar at the end of the tail is
    common; that the white edging to the outer tail-feathers is not
    rare; but that the white croup is extremely rare, and the two black
    bars on the wings occur in no other pigeon, excepting the alpine
    <I>C. leuconota</I> and <I>C. rupestris</I> of Asia. Now if we turn
    to the domestic races, it is highly remarkable, as an eminent
    fancier, Mr. Wicking, observed to me, that, whenever a blue bird
    appears in any race, the wings almost invariably show the double
    black bars.<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> The primary
    wing-feathers may be white or black, and the whole body may be of
    any colour, but if the wing-coverts are blue, the two black bars
    are sure to appear. I have myself seen, or acquired trustworthy
    evidence, as given below,<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> of blue
    birds with black bars on the wing, with the croup either white or
    very pale or dark blue, with the tail having a terminal black bar,
    and with the outer feathers externally edged with white or very
    pale coloured, in the following races, which, as I carefully
    observed in each case, appeared to be perfectly true: namely, in
    Pouters, Fantails, Tumblers, Jacobins, Turbits, Barbs, Carriers,
    Runts of three distinct varieties, Trumpeters, Swallows, and in
    many other toy-pigeons, which as being closely allied to <I>C.
    livia,</I> are not worth enumerating. Thus we see that, in
    purely-bred races of every kind known in Europe, blue birds
    occasionally appear having all the marks which characterise <I>C.
    livia,</I> and which concur in no other wild species. Mr. Blyth,
    also, has made the same observation with respect to the various
    domestic races known in India.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Certain variations in the plumage are equally
    common in the wild <I>C. livia,</I> in dovecot-pigeons, and in all
    the most highly modified races. Thus, in all, the croup varies from
    white to blue, being most frequently white in Europe, and very
    generally blue in India.<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> We have
    seen that the wild <I>C. livia</I> in Europe, and dovecots in all
    parts of the world, often have the upper wing-coverts chequered
    with black; and all the most distinct races, when blue, are
    occasionally chequered in precisely the same manner. Thus I have
    seen Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Turbits, Tumblers (Indian and
    English), Swallows, Bald-pates, and other toy-pigeons blue and
    chequered; and Mr. Esquilant has seen a chequered Runt. I bred from
    two pure blue Tumblers a chequered bird.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The facts hitherto given refer to the occasional
    appearance in pure races of blue birds with black wing-bars, and
    likewise of blue and chequered birds; but it will now be seen that
    when two birds belonging to distinct races are crossed, neither of
    which have, nor probably have had during many generations, a trace
    of blue in their plumage, or a trace of wing-bars and the other
    characteristic marks, they very frequently produce mongrel
    offspring of a blue colour, sometimes chequered, with black
    wing-bars, etc.; or if not of a blue colour, yet with the several
    characteristic marks more or less plainly developed. I was led to
    investigate this subject from MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233;<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> having asserted that from crosses
    between certain breeds it is rare to get anything but bisets or
    dovecot pigeons, which, as we know, are blue birds with the usual
    characteristic marks. We shall hereafter see that this subject
    possesses, independently of our present object, considerable
    interest, so that I will give the results of my own trials in full.
    I selected for experiment races which, when pure, very seldom
    produce birds of a blue colour, or have bars on their wings and
    tail.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The Nun is white, with the head, tail, and
    primary wing-feathers black; it is a breed which was established as
    long ago as the year 1600. I crossed a male Nun with a female red
    common Tumbler, which latter variety generally breeds true. Thus
    neither parent had a trace of blue in the plumage, or of bars on
    the wing and tail. I should premise that common Tumblers are rarely
    blue in England. From the above cross I reared several young: one
    was red over the whole back, but with the tail as blue as that of
    the rock-pigeon; the terminal bar, however, was absent, but the
    outer feathers were edged with white: a second and third nearly
    resembled the first, but the tail in both presented a trace of the
    bar at the end: a fourth was brownish, and the wings showed a trace
    of the double bar: a fifth was pale blue over the whole breast,
    back, croup, and tail, but the neck and primary wing-feathers were
    reddish; the wings presented two distinct bars of a red colour; the
    tail was not barred, but the outer feathers were edged with white.
    I crossed this last curiously coloured bird with a black mongrel of
    complicated descent, namely, from a black Barb, a Spot, and
    Almond-tumbler, so that the two young birds produced from this
    cross included the blood of five varieties, none of which had a
    trace of blue or of wing and tail-bars: one of the two young birds
    was brownish-black, with black wing-bars; the other was
    reddish-dun, with reddish wing-bars, paler than the rest of the
    body, with the croup pale blue, the tail bluish with a trace of the
    terminal bar.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Eaton<A href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
    matched two Short-faced Tumblers, namely, a splash cock and kite
    hen (neither of which are blue or barred), and from the first nest
    he got a perfect blue bird, and from the second a silver or pale
    blue bird, both of which, in accordance with all analogy, no doubt
    presented the usual characteristic marks.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I crossed two male black Barbs with two female
    red Spots. These latter have the whole body and wings white, with a
    spot on the forehead, the tail and tail-coverts red; the race
    existed at least as long ago as 1676, and now breeds perfectly
    true, as was known to be the case in the year 1735.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> Barbs are uniformly-coloured birds, with
    rarely even a trace of bars on the wing or tail; they are known to
    breed very true. The mongrels thus raised were black or nearly
    black, or dark or pale brown, sometimes slightly piebald with
    white: of these birds no less than six presented double wing-bars;
    in two the bars were conspicuous and quite black; in seven some
    white feathers appeared on the croup; and in two or three there was
    a trace of the terminal bar to the tail, but in none were the outer
    tail-feathers edged with white.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I crossed black Barbs (of two excellent strains)
    with purely-bred, snow-white Fantails. The mongrels were generally
    quite black, with a few of the primary wing and tail feathers
    white: others were dark reddish-brown, and others snow-white: none
    had a trace of wing-bars or of the white croup. I then paired
    together two of these mongrels, namely, a brown and black bird, and
    their offspring displayed wing-bars, faint, but of a darker brown
    than the rest of body. In a second brood from the same parents a
    brown bird was produced, with several white feathers confined to
    the croup.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I crossed a male dun Dragon belonging to a
    family which had been dun- coloured without wing-bars during
    several generations, with a uniform red Barb (bred from two black
    Barbs); and the offspring presented decided but faint traces of
    wing-bars. I crossed a uniform red male Runt with a White
    trumpeter; and the offspring had a slaty-blue tail with a bar at
    the end, and with the outer feathers edged with white. I also
    crossed a female black and white chequered Trumpeter (of a
    different strain from the last) with a male Almond-tumbler, neither
    of which exhibited a trace of blue, or of the white croup, or of
    the bar at end of tail: nor is it probable that the progenitors of
    these two birds had for many generations exhibited any of these
    characters, for I have never even heard of a blue Trumpeter in this
    country, and my Almond-tumbler was purely bred; yet the tail of
    this mongrel was bluish, with a broad black bar at the end, and the
    croup was perfectly white. It may be observed in several of these
    cases, that the tail first shows a tendency to become by reversion
    blue; and this fact of the persistency of colour in the tail and
    tail-coverts<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> will surprise no one
    who has attended to the crossing of pigeons.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The last case which I will give is the most
    curious. I paired a mongrel female Barb-fantail with a mongrel male
    Barb-spot; neither of which mongrels had the least blue about them.
    Let it be remembered that blue Barbs are excessively rare; that
    Spots, as has been already stated, were perfectly characterised in
    the year 1676, and breed perfectly true; this likewise is the case
    with white Fantails, so much so that I have never heard of white
    Fantails throwing any other colour. Nevertheless the offspring from
    the above two mongrels was of exactly the same blue tint as that of
    the wild rock-pigeon from the Shetland Islands over the whole back
    and wings; the double black wing-bars were equally conspicuous; the
    tail was exactly alike in all its characters, and the croup was
    pure white; the head, however, was tinted with a shade of red,
    evidently derived from the Spot, and was of a paler blue than in
    the rock-pigeon, as was the stomach. So that two black Barbs, a red
    Spot, and a white Fantail, as the four purely-bred grandparents,
    produced a bird exhibiting the general blue colour, together with
    every characteristic mark, the wild <I>Columba livia.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to crossed breeds frequently
    producing blue birds chequered with black, and resembling in all
    respects both the dovecot-pigeon and the chequered wild variety of
    the rock-pigeon, the statement before referred to by MM. Boitard
    and Corbi&#233; would almost suffice; but I will give three
    instances of the appearance of such birds from crosses in which one
    alone of the parents or great-grandparents was blue, but not
    chequered. I crossed a male blue Turbit with a snow-white
    Trumpeter, and the following year with a dark, leaden-brown,
    Short-faced Tumbler; the offspring from the first cross were as
    perfectly chequered as any dovecot-pigeon; and from the second, so
    much so as to be nearly as black as the most darkly chequered
    rock-pigeon from Madeira. Another bird, whose great-grandparents
    were a white Trumpeter, a white Fantail, a white Red-spot, a red
    Runt, and a blue Pouter, was slaty-blue and chequered exactly like
    a dovecot-pigeon. I may here add a remark made to me by Mr.
    Wicking, who has had more experience than any other person in
    England in breeding pigeons of various colours: namely, that when a
    blue, or a blue and chequered bird, having black wing- bars, once
    appears in any race and is allowed to breed, these characters are
    so strongly transmitted that it is extremely difficult to eradicate
    them.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">What, then, are we to conclude from this
    tendency in all the chief domestic races, both when purely bred and
    more especially when intercrossed, to produce offspring of a blue
    colour, with the same characteristic marks, varying in the same
    manner, as in <I>Columbia livia</I>? If we admit that these races
    are all descended from <I>C. livia,</I> no breeder will doubt that
    the occasional appearance of blue birds thus characterised is
    accounted for on the well-known principle of "throwing back" or
    reversion. Why crossing should give so strong a tendency to
    reversion, we do not with certainty know; but abundant evidence of
    this fact will be given in the following chapters. It is probable
    that I might have bred even for a century pure black Barbs, Spots,
    Nuns, white Fantails, Trumpeters, etc., without obtaining a single
    blue or barred bird; yet by crossing these breeds I reared in the
    first and second generation, during the course of only three or
    four years, a considerable number of young birds, more or less
    plainly coloured blue, and with most of the characteristic marks.
    When black and white, or black and red birds, are crossed, it would
    appear that a slight tendency exists in both parents to produce
    blue offspring, and that this, when combined, overpowers the
    separate tendency in either parent to produce black, or white, or
    red offspring.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If we reject the belief that all the races of
    the pigeon are the modified descendants of <I>C. livia,</I> and
    suppose that they are descended from several aboriginal stocks,
    then we must choose between the three following assumptions:
    firstly, that at least eight or nine species formerly existed which
    were aboriginally coloured in various ways, but have since varied
    in exactly the same manner so as to assume the colouring of <I>C.
    livia</I>; but this assumption throws not the least light on the
    appearance of such colours and marks when the races are crossed. Or
    secondly, we may assume that the aboriginal species were all
    coloured blue, and had the wing-bars and other characteristic marks
    of <I>C. livia,</I>&#8212;a supposition which is highly improbable,
    as besides this one species no existing member of the
    Columbid&#230; presents these combined characters; and it would not
    be possible to find any other instance of several species identical
    in plumage, yet as different in important points of structure as
    are Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, Tumblers, etc. Or lastly, we may
    assume that all the races, whether descended from <I>C. livia</I>
    or from several aboriginal species, although they have been bred
    with so much care and are so highly valued by fanciers, have all
    been crossed within a dozen or score of generations with <I>C.
    livia,</I> and have thus acquired their tendency to produce blue
    birds with the several characteristic marks. I have said that it
    must be assumed that each race has been crossed with <I>C.
    livia</I> within a dozen, or, at the utmost, within a score of
    generations; for there is no reason to believe that crossed
    offspring ever revert to one of their ancestors when removed by a
    greater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed
    only once, the tendency to reversion will naturally become less and
    less in the succeeding generations, as in each there will be less
    and less of the blood of the foreign breed; but when there has been
    no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both
    parents to revert to some long-lost character, this tendency, for
    all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted
    undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two
    distinct cases of reversion are often confounded together by those
    who have written on inheritance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Considering, on the one hand, the improbability
    of the three assumptions which have just been discussed, and, on
    the other hand, how simply the facts are explained on the principle
    of reversion, we may conclude that the occasional appearance in all
    the races, both when purely bred and more especially when crossed,
    of blue birds, sometimes chequered, with double wing-bars, with
    white or blue croups, with a bar at the end of the tail, and with
    the outer tail-feathers edged with white, affords an argument of
    the greatest weight in favour of the view that all are descended
    from <I>Columba livia,</I> including under this name the three or
    four wild varieties or sub-species before enumerated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">To sum up the six foregoing arguments, which are
    opposed to the belief that the chief domestic races are the
    descendants of at least eight or nine or perhaps a dozen species;
    for the crossing of any less number would not yield the
    characteristic differences between the several races. <I>
    Firstly,</I> the improbability that so many species should still
    exist somewhere, but be unknown to ornithologists, or that they
    should have become within the historical period extinct, although
    man has had so little influence in exterminating the wild <I>C.
    livia. Secondly,</I> the improbability of man in former times
    having thoroughly domesticated and rendered fertile under
    confinement so many species. <I>Thirdly,</I> these supposed species
    having nowhere become feral. <I>Fourthly,</I> the extraordinary
    fact that man should, intentionally or by chance, have chosen for
    domestication several species, extremely abnormal in character; and
    furthermore, the points of structure which render these supposed
    species so abnormal being now highly variable. <I>Fifthly,</I> the
    fact of all the races, though differing in many important points of
    structure, producing perfectly fertile mongrels; whilst all the
    hybrids which have been produced between even closely allied
    species in the pigeon-family are sterile. <I>Sixthly,</I> the
    remarkable statements just given on the tendency in all the races,
    both when purely bred and when crossed, to revert in numerous
    minute details of colouring to the character of the wild
    rock-pigeon, and to vary in a similar manner. To these arguments
    may be added the extreme improbability that a number of species
    formerly existed, which differed greatly from each other in some
    few points, but which resembled each other as closely as do the
    domestic races in other points of structure, in voice, and in all
    their habits of life. When these several facts and arguments are
    fairly taken into consideration, it would require an overwhelming
    amount of evidence to make us admit that the chief domestic races
    are descended from several aboriginal stocks; and of such evidence
    there is absolutely none.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The belief that the chief domestic races are
    descended from several wild stocks no doubt has arisen from the
    apparent improbability of such great modifications of structure
    having been effected since man first domesticated the rock-pigeon.
    Nor am I surprised at any degree of hesitation in admitting their
    common parentage: formerly, when I went into my aviaries and
    watched such birds as Pouters, Carriers, Barbs, Fantails, and
    Short-faced Tumblers, etc., I could not persuade myself that all
    had descended from the same wild stock, and that man had
    consequently in one sense created these remarkable modifications.
    Therefore I have argued the question of their origin at great, and,
    as some will think, superfluous length.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, in favour of the belief that all the
    races are descended from a single stock, we have in <I>Columba
    livia</I> a still existing and widely distributed species, which
    can be and has been domesticated in various countries. This species
    agrees in most points of structure and in all its habits of life,
    as well as occasionally in every detail of plumage, with the
    several domestic races. It breeds freely with them, and produces
    fertile offspring. It varies in a state of nature,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> and still more so when
    semi-domesticated, as shown by comparing the Sierra Leone pigeons
    with those of India, or with those which apparently have run wild
    in Madeira. It has undergone a still greater amount of variation in
    the case of the numerous toy-pigeons, which no one supposes to be
    descended from distinct species; yet some of these toy-pigeons have
    transmitted their character truly for centuries. Why, then, should
    we hesitate to believe in that greater amount of variation which is
    necessary for the production of the eleven chief races? It should
    be borne in mind that in two of the most strongly-marked races,
    namely, Carriers and Short-faced Tumblers, the extreme forms can be
    connected with the parent-species by graduated differences not
    greater than those which may be observed between the
    dovecot-pigeons inhabiting different countries, or between the
    various kinds of toy-pigeons,&#8212;gradations which must certainly
    be attributed to variation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That circumstances have been eminently
    favourable for the modification of the pigeon through variation and
    selection will now be shown. The earliest record, as has been
    pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius, of pigeons in a
    domesticated condition, occurs in the fifth Egyptian dynasty, about
    3000 B.C.;<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> but Mr. Birch, of the
    British Museum, informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill of
    fare in the previous dynasty. Domestic pigeons are mentioned in
    Genesis, Leviticus, and Isaiah.<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
    In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> immense prices were given for pigeons;
    "nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their
    pedigree and race." In India, about the year 1600, pigeons were
    much valued by Akbar Khan: 20,000 birds were carried about with the
    court, and the merchants brought valuable collections. "The monarch
    of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare breeds. His Majesty,"
    says the courtly historian, "by crossing the breeds, which method
    was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> Akber Khan possessed seventeen
    distinct kinds, eight of which were valuable for beauty alone. At
    about this same period of 1600 the Dutch, according to Aldrovandi,
    were as eager about pigeons as the Romans had formerly been. The
    breeds which were kept during the fifteenth century in Europe and
    in India apparently differed from each other. Tavernier, in his
    Travels in 1677, speaks, as does Chardin in 1735, of the vast
    number of pigeon-houses in Persia; and the former remarks that, as
    Christians were not permitted to keep pigeons, some of the vulgar
    actually turned Mahometans for this sole purpose. The Emperor of
    Morocco had his favourite keeper of pigeons, as is mentioned in
    Moore's treatise, published 1737. In England, from the time of
    Willughby in 1678 to the present day, as well as in Germany and in
    France, numerous treatises have been published on the pigeon. In
    India, about a hundred years ago, a Persian treatise was written;
    and the writer thought it no light affair, for he begins with a
    solemn invocation, "in the name of God, the gracious and merciful."
    Many large towns, in Europe and the United States, now have their
    societies of devoted pigeon-fanciers: at present there are three
    such societies in London. In India, as I hear from Mr. Blyth, the
    inhabitants of Delhi and of some other great cities are eager
    fanciers. Mr. Layard informs me that most of the known breeds are
    kept in Ceylon. In China, according to Mr. Swinhoe of Amoy, and Dr.
    Lockhart of Shangai, Carriers, Fantails, Tumblers, and other
    varieties are reared with care, especially by the bonzes or
    priests. The Chinese fasten a kind of whistle to the tail-feathers
    of their pigeons, and as the flock wheels through the air they
    produce a sweet sound. In Egypt the late Abbas Pacha was a great
    fancier of Fantails. Many pigeons are kept at Cairo and
    Constantinople, and these have lately been imported by native
    merchants, as I hear from Sir W. Elliot, into Southern India, and
    sold at high prices.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The foregoing statements show in how many
    countries, and during how long a period, many men have been
    passionately devoted to the breeding of pigeons. Hear how an
    enthusiastic fancier at the present day writes: "If it were
    possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing amount of
    solace and pleasure derived from Almond Tumblers, when they begin
    to understand their properties, I should think that scarce any
    nobleman or gentleman would be without their aviaries of Almond
    Tumblers."<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> The pleasure thus
    taken is of paramount importance, as it leads amateurs carefully to
    note and preserve each slight deviation of structure which strikes
    their fancy. Pigeons are often closely confined during their whole
    lives; they do not partake of their naturally varied diet; they
    have often been transported from one climate to another; and all
    these changes in their conditions of life would be likely to cause
    variability. Pigeons have been domesticated for nearly 5000 years,
    and have been kept in many places, so that the numbers reared under
    domestication must have been enormous: and this is another
    circumstance of high importance, for it obviously favours the
    chance of rare modifications of structure occasionally appearing.
    Slight variations of all kinds would almost certainly be observed,
    and, if valued, would, owing to the following circumstances, be
    preserved and propagated with unusual facility. Pigeons,
    differently from any other domesticated animal, can easily be mated
    for life, and, though kept with other pigeons, rarely prove
    unfaithful to each other. Even when the male does break his
    marriage-vow, he does not permanently desert his mate. I have bred
    in the same aviaries many pigeons of different kinds, and never
    reared a single bird of an impure strain. Hence a fancier can with
    the greatest ease select and match his birds. He will also see the
    good results of his care; for pigeons breed with extraordinary
    rapidity. He may freely reject inferior birds, as they serve at an
    early age as excellent food.</P>

      <I>History of the principal Races of the Pigeon.</I><A href= 
      "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Before discussing the means and steps by
    which the chief races have been formed, it will be advisable to
    give some historical details, for more is known of the history of
    the pigeon, little though this is, than of any other domesticated
    animal. Some of the cases are interesting as proving how long
    domestic varieties may be propagated with exactly the same or
    nearly the same characters; and other cases are still more
    interesting as showing how slowly but steadily races have been
    greatly modified during successive generations. In the last chapter
    I stated that Trumpeters and Laughers, both so remarkable for their
    voices, seem to have been perfectly characterised in 1735; and
    Laughers were apparently known in India before the year 1600. Spots
    in 1676, and Nuns in the time of Aldrovandi, before 1600, were
    coloured exactly as they now are. Common Tumblers and Ground
    Tumblers displayed in India, before the year 1600, the same
    extraordinary peculiarities of flight as at the present day, for
    they are well described in the 'Ayeen Akbery.' These breeds may all
    have existed for a much longer period; we know only that they were
    perfectly characterised at the dates above given. The <I>
    average</I> length of life of the domestic pigeon is probably about
    five or six years; if so, some of these races have retained their
    character perfectly for at least forty or fifty
    generations.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Pouters.</I>&#8212;These birds, as far
    as a very short description serves for comparison, appear to have
    been well characterised in Aldrovandi's time,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> before the year 1600. Length of body and
    length of leg are at the present time the two chief points of
    excellence. In 1735 Moore said (see Mr. J. M. Eaton's
    edition)&#8212;and Moore was a first-rate fancier&#8212;that he
    once saw a bird with a body 20 inches in length, "though 17 or 18
    inches is reckoned a very good length;" and he has seen the legs
    very nearly 7 inches in length, yet a leg 6&#189; or 6&#190; long
    "must be allowed to be a very good one." Mr. Bult, the most
    successful breeder of Pouters in the world, informs me that at
    present (1858) the standard length of the body is not less than 18
    inches; but he has measured one bird 19 inches in length, and has
    heard of 20 and 22 inches, but doubts the truth of these latter
    statements. The standard length of the leg is now 7 inches, but Mr.
    Bult has recently measured two of his own birds with legs 7&#189;
    long. So that in the 123 years which have elapsed since 1735 there
    has been hardly any increase in the standard length of the body; 17
    or 18 inches was formerly reckoned a very good length, and now 18
    inches is the minimum standard; but the length of leg seems to have
    increased, as Moore never saw one quite 7 inches long; now the
    standard is 7, and two of Mr. Bult's birds measured 7&#189; inches
    in length. The extremely slight improvement in Pouters, except in
    the length of the leg, during the last 123 years, may be partly
    accounted for by the neglect which they suffered, as I am informed
    by Mr. Bult, until within the last 20 or 30 years. About 1765<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> there was a change of fashion,
    stouter and more feathered legs being preferred to thin and nearly
    naked legs.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Fantails.</I>&#8212;The first notice
    of the existence of this breed is in India, before the year 1600,
    as given in the 'Ayeen Akbery;'<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
    at this date, judging from Aldrovandi, the breed was unknown in
    Europe. In 1677 Willughby speaks of a Fantail with 26
    tail-feathers; in 1735 Moore saw one with 36 feathers; and in 1824
    MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233; assert that in France birds can easily
    be found with 42 tail-feathers. In England, the number of the
    tail-feathers is not at present so much regarded as their upward
    direction and expansion. The general carriage of the bird is
    likewise now much valued. The old descriptions do not suffice to
    show whether in these latter respects there has been much
    improvement: but if Fantails with their heads and tails touching
    had formerly existed, as at the present time, the fact would almost
    certainly have been noticed. The Fantails which are now found in
    India probably show the state of the race, as far as carriage is
    concerned, at the date of their introduction into Europe; and some,
    said to have been brought from Calcutta, which I kept alive, were
    in a marked manner inferior to our exhibition birds. The Java
    Fantail shows the same difference in carriage; and although Mr.
    Swinhoe has counted 18 and 24 tail-feathers in his birds, a
    first-rate specimen sent to me had only 14
    tail-feathers.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Jacobins.</I>&#8212;This breed existed
    before 1600, but the hood, judging from the figure given by
    Aldrovandi, did not enclose the head nearly so perfectly as at
    present: nor was the head then white; nor were the wings and tail
    so long, but this last character might have been overlooked by the
    rude artist. In Moore's time, in 1735, the Jacobin was considered
    the smallest kind of pigeon, and the bill is said to be very short.
    Hence either the Jacobin, or the other kinds with which it was then
    compared, must since that time have been considerably modified; for
    Moore's description (and it must be remembered that he was a
    first-rate judge) is clearly not applicable, as far as size of body
    and length of beak are concerned, to our present Jacobins. In 1795,
    judging from Bechstein, the breed had assumed its present
    character.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Turbits.</I>&#8212;It has generally
    been supposed by the older writers on pigeons, that the Turbit is
    the Cortbeck of Aldrovandi; but if this be the case, it is an
    extraordinary fact that the characteristic frill should not have
    been noticed. The beak, moreover, of the Cortbeck is described as
    closely resembling that of the Jacobin, which shows a change in the
    one or the other race. The Turbit, with its characteristic frill,
    and bearing its present name, is described by Willughby in 1677;
    and the bill is said to be like that of the bullfinch,&#8212;a good
    comparison, but now more strictly applicable to the beak of the
    Barb. The sub-breed called the Owl was well known in Moore's time,
    in 1735.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Tumblers.</I>&#8212;Common Tumblers,
    as well as Ground Tumblers, perfect as far as tumbling is
    concerned, existed in India before the year 1600; and at this
    period diversified modes of flight, such as flying at night, the
    ascent to a great height, and manner of descent, seem to have been
    much attended to in India, as at the present time. Belon<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> in 1555 saw in Paphlagonia what he
    describes as "a very new thing, viz. pigeons which flew so high in
    the air that they were lost to view, but returned to their
    pigeon-house without separating." This manner of flight is
    characteristic of our present Tumblers, but it is clear that Belon
    would have mentioned the act of tumbling if the pigeons described
    by him had tumbled. Tumblers were not known in Europe in 1600, as
    they are not mentioned by Aldrovandi, who discusses the flight of
    pigeons. They are briefly alluded to by Willughby, in 1687, as
    small pigeons "which show like footballs in the air." The
    short-faced race did not exist at this period, as Willughby could
    not have overlooked birds so remarkable for their small size and
    short beaks. We can even trace some of the steps by which this race
    has been produced. Moore in 1735 enumerates correctly the chief
    points of excellence, but does not give any description of the
    several sub-breeds; and from this fact Mr. Eaton infers<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> that the Short-faced Tumbler had not
    then come to full perfection. Moore even speaks of the Jacobin as
    being the smallest pigeon. Thirty years afterwards, in 1765, in the
    Treatise dedicated to Mayor, short-faced Almond Tumblers are fully
    described, but the author, an excellent fancier, expressly states
    in his Preface (p. xiv.) that, "from great care and expense in
    breeding them, they have arrived to so great perfection and are so
    different from what they were 20 or 30 years past, that an old
    fancier would have condemned them for no other reason than because
    they are not like what used to be thought good when he was in the
    fancy before." Hence it would appear that there was a rather sudden
    change in the character of the short-faced Tumbler at about this
    period; and there is reason to suspect that a dwarfed and
    half-monstrous bird, the parent-form of the several short-faced
    sub-breeds, then appeared. I suspect this because short-faced
    Tumblers are born with their beaks (ascertained by careful
    measurement) as short, proportionally with the size of their
    bodies, as in the adult bird; and in this respect they differ
    greatly from all other breeds, which slowly acquire during growth
    their various characteristic qualities.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Since the year 1765 there has been some
    change in one of the chief characters of the short-faced Tumbler,
    namely, in the length of the beak. Fanciers measure the "head and
    beak" from the tip of the beak to the front corner of the eyeball.
    About the year 1765 a "head and beak" was considered good,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> which, measured in the usual manner, was
    7/8 of an inch in length; now it ought not to exceed 5/8 of an
    inch; "it is however possible," as Mr. Eaton candidly confesses,
    "for a bird to be considered as pleasant or neat even at 6/8 of an
    inch, but exceeding that length it must be looked upon as unworthy
    of attention." Mr. Eaton states that he has never seen in the
    course of his life more than two or three birds with the "head and
    beak" not exceeding half an inch in length; "still I believe in the
    course of a few years that the head and beak will be shortened, and
    that half-inch birds will not be considered so great a curiosity as
    at the present time." That Mr. Eaton's opinion deserves attention
    cannot be doubted, considering his success in winning prizes at our
    exhibitions. Finally in regard to the Tumbler it may be concluded
    from the facts above given that it was originally introduced into
    Europe, probably first into England, from the East; and that it
    then resembled our common English Tumbler, or more probably the
    Persian or Indian Tumbler, with a beak only just perceptibly
    shorter than that of the common dovecot-pigeon. With respect to the
    short-faced Tumbler, which is not known to exist in the East, there
    can hardly be a doubt that the whole wonderful change in the size
    of the head, beak, body and feet, and in general carriage, has been
    produced during the last two centuries by continued selection,
    aided probably by the birth of a semi- monstrous bird somewhere
    about the year 1750.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Runts.</I>&#8212;Of their history
    little can be said. In the time of Pliny the pigeons of Campania
    were the largest known; and from this fact alone some authors
    assert that they were Runts. In Aldrovandi's time, in 1600, two
    sub-breeds existed; but one of them, the short-beaked, is now
    extinct in Europe.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Barbs.</I>&#8212;Notwithstanding
    statements to the contrary, it seems to me impossible to recognise
    the Barb in Aldrovandi's description and figures; four breeds,
    however, existed in the year 1600 which evidently were allied both
    to Barbs and Carriers. To show how difficult it is to recognise
    some of the breeds described by Aldrovandi I will give the
    different opinions in regard to the above four kinds, named by him
    <I>C. indica, cretensis, gutturosa,</I> and <I>persica.</I>
    Willughby thought that the <I>Columba indica</I> was a Turbit, but
    the eminent fancier Mr. Brent believes that it was an inferior
    Barb: <I>C. cretensis,</I> with a short beak and a swelling on the
    upper mandible, cannot be recognised: <I>C.</I> (falsely called)
    <I>gutturosa,</I> which from its <I>rostrum, breve, crassum, et
    tuberosum</I> seems to me to come nearest to the Barb, Mr. Brent
    believes to be a Carrier; and lastly, the <I>C. persica et
    turcica,</I> Mr. Brent thinks, and I quite concur with him, was a
    short-beaked Carrier with very little wattle. In 1687 the Barb was
    known in England, and Willughby describes the beak as like that of
    the Turbit; but it is not credible that his Barbs should have had a
    beak like that of our present birds, for so accurate an observer
    could not have overlooked its great breadth.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>English Carrier.</I>&#8212;We may look
    in vain in Aldrovandi's work for any bird resembling our prize
    Carriers; the <I>C. persica et turcica</I> of this author comes the
    nearest, but is said to have had a short thick beak; therefore it
    must have approached in character a Barb, and have differed greatly
    from our Carriers. In Willughby's time, in 1677, we can clearly
    recognise the Carrier, yet he adds, "the bill is not short, but of
    a moderate length;" a description which no one would apply to our
    present Carriers, so conspicuous for the extraordinary length of
    their beaks. The old names given in Europe to the Carrier, and the
    several names now in use in India, indicate that Carriers
    originally came from Persia; and Willughby's description would
    perfectly apply to the Bussorah Carrier as it now exists in Madras.
    In later times we can partially trace the progress of change in our
    English Carriers: Moore, in 1735, says "an inch and a half is
    reckoned a long beak, though there are very good Carriers that are
    found not to exceed an inch and a quarter." These birds must have
    resembled or perhaps been a little superior to the Carriers,
    previously described, now found in Persia. In England at the
    present day "there are," as Mr. Eaton<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> states, "beaks that would measure (from
    edge of eye to tip of beak) one inch and three-quarters, and some
    few even two inches in length."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From these historical details we see that nearly
    all the chief domestic races existed before the year 1600. Some
    remarkable only for colour appear to have been identical with our
    present breeds, some were nearly the same, some considerably
    different, and some have since become extinct. Several breeds, such
    as Finnikins and Turners, the swallow-tailed pigeon of Bechstein
    and the Carmelite, seem to have originated and to have disappeared
    within this same period. Any one now visiting a well-stocked
    English aviary would certainly pick out as the most distinct kinds,
    the massive Runt, the Carrier with its wonderfully elongated beak
    and great wattles, the Barb with its short broad beak and
    eye-wattles, the short-faced Tumbler with its small conical beak,
    the Pouter with its great crop, long legs and body, the Fantail
    with its upraised, widely-expanded, well-feathered tail, the Turbit
    with its frill and short blunt beak, and the Jacobin with his hood.
    Now, if this same person could have viewed the pigeons kept before
    1600 by Akber Khan in India and by Aldrovandi in Europe, he would
    have seen the Jacobin with a less perfect hood; the Turbit
    apparently without its frill; the Pouter with shorter legs, and in
    every way less remarkable&#8212;that is, if Aldrovandi's Pouter
    resembled the old German kind; the Fantail would have been far less
    singular in appearance, and would have had much fewer feathers in
    its tail; he would have seen excellent flying Tumblers, but he
    would in vain have looked for the marvellous short-faced breeds; he
    would have seen birds allied to Barbs, but it is extremely doubtful
    whether he would have met with our actual Barbs; and lastly, he
    would have found Carriers with beaks and wattle incomparably less
    developed than in our English Carriers. He might have classed most
    of the breeds in the same groups as at present; but the differences
    between the groups were then far less strongly pronounced than at
    present. In short, the several breeds had at this early period not
    diverged in so great a degree as now from their aboriginal common
    parent, the wild rock-pigeon.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Manner of Formation of the chief Races.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We will now consider more closely the probable
    steps by which the chief races have been formed. As long as pigeons
    are kept semi-domesticated in dovecots in their native country,
    without any care in selecting and matching them, they are liable to
    little more variation than the wild <I>C. livia,</I> namely, in the
    wings becoming chequered with black, in the croup being blue or
    white, and in the size of the body. When, however, dovecot-pigeons
    are transported into diversified countries, such as Sierra Leone,
    the Malay archipelago, and Madeira, they are exposed to new
    conditions of life; and apparently in consequence vary in a
    somewhat greater degree. When closely confined, either for the
    pleasure of watching them, or to prevent their straying, they must
    be exposed, even in their native climate, to considerably different
    conditions; for they cannot obtain their natural diversity of food;
    and, what is probably more important, they are abundantly fed,
    whilst debarred from taking much exercise. Under these
    circumstances we might expect to find, from the analogy of all
    other domesticated animals, a greater amount of individual
    variability than with the wild pigeon; and this is the case. The
    want of exercise apparently tends to reduce the size of the feet
    and organs of flight; and then, from the law of correlation of
    growth, the beak apparently becomes affected. From what we now see
    occasionally taking place in our aviaries, we may conclude that
    sudden variations or sports, such as the appearance of a crest of
    feathers on the head, of feathered feet, of a new shade of colour,
    of an additional feather in the tail or wing, would occur at rare
    intervals during the many centuries which have elapsed since the
    pigeon was first domesticated. At the present day such "sports" are
    generally rejected as blemishes; and there is so much mystery in
    the breeding of pigeons that, if a valuable sport did occur, its
    history would often be concealed. Before the last hundred and fifty
    years, there is hardly a chance of the history of any such sport
    having been recorded. But it by no means follows from this that
    such sports in former times, when the pigeon had undergone much
    less variation, would have been rejected. We are profoundly
    ignorant of the cause of each sudden and apparently spontaneous
    variation, as well as of the infinitely numerous shades of
    difference between the birds of the same family. But in a future
    chapter we shall see that all such variations appear to be the
    indirect result of changes of some kind in the conditions of
    life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Hence, after a long course of domestication, we
    might expect to see in the pigeon much individual variability, and
    occasional sudden variations, as well as slight modifications from
    the lessened use of certain parts, together with the effects of
    correlation of growth. But without selection all this would produce
    only a trifling or no result; for without such aid differences of
    all kinds would, from the two following causes, soon disappear. In
    a healthy and vigorous lot of pigeons many more young birds are
    killed for food or die than are reared to maturity; so that an
    individual having any peculiar character, if not selected, would
    run a good chance of being destroyed; and if not destroyed, the
    peculiarity in question would generally be obliterated by free
    intercrossing. It might, however, occasionally happen that the same
    variation repeatedly occurred, owing to the action of peculiar and
    uniform conditions of life, and in this case it would prevail
    independently of selection. But when selection is brought into play
    all is changed; for this is the foundation-stone in the formation
    of new races; and with the pigeon, circumstances, as we have
    already seen, are eminently favourable for selection. When a bird
    presenting some conspicuous variation has been preserved, and its
    offspring have been selected, carefully matched, and again
    propagated, and so onwards during successive generations, the
    principle is so obvious that nothing more need be said about it.
    This may be called <I>methodical selection,</I> for the breeder has
    a distinct object in view, namely, to preserve some character which
    has actually appeared; or to create some improvement already
    pictured in his mind.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Another form of selection has hardly been
    noticed by those authors who have discussed this subject, but is
    even more important. This form may be called <I>unconscious
    selection,</I> for the breeder selects his birds unconsciously,
    unintentionally, and without method, yet he surely though slowly
    produces a great result. I refer to the effects which follow from
    each fancier at first procuring and afterwards rearing as good
    birds as he can, according to his skill, and according to the
    standard of excellence at each successive period. He does not wish
    permanently to modify the breed; he does not look to the distant
    future, or speculate on the final result of the slow accumulation
    during many generations of successive slight changes; he is content
    if he possesses a good stock, and more than content if he can beat
    his rivals. The fancier in the time of Aldrovandi, when in the year
    1600 he admired his own Jacobins, Pouters, or Carriers, never
    reflected what their descendants in the year 1860 would become: he
    would have been astonished could he have seen our Jacobins, our
    improved English Carriers, and our Pouters; he would probably have
    denied that they were the descendants of his own once-admired
    stock, and he would perhaps not have valued them, for no other
    reason, as was written in 1765, "than because they were not like
    what used to be thought good when he was in the fancy." No one will
    attribute the lengthened beak of the Carrier, the shortened beak of
    the Short-faced Tumbler, the lengthened leg of the Pouter, the more
    perfectly enclosed hood of the Jacobin, etc.&#8212;changes effected
    since the time of Aldrovandi, or even since a much later
    period,&#8212;to the direct and immediate action of the conditions
    of life. For these several races have been modified in various and
    even in directly opposite ways, though kept under the same climate
    and treated in all respects in as nearly uniform a manner as
    possible. Each slight change in the length or shortness of the
    beak, in the length of leg, etc., has no doubt been indirectly and
    remotely caused by some change in the conditions to which the bird
    has been subjected, but we must attribute the final result, as is
    manifest in those cases of which we have any historical record, to
    the continued selection and accumulation of many slight successive
    variations.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The action of unconscious selection, as far as
    pigeons are concerned, depends on a universal principle in human
    nature, namely, on our rivalry, and desire to outdo our neighbours.
    We see this in every fleeting fashion, even in our dress, and it
    leads the fancier to endeavour to exaggerate every peculiarity in
    his breeds. A great authority on pigeons,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> says, "Fanciers do not and will not
    admire a medium standard, that is, half and half, which is neither
    here nor there, but admire extremes." After remarking that the
    fancier of Short-faced Beard Tumblers wishes for a very short beak,
    and that the fancier of Long-faced Beard Tumblers wishes for a very
    long beak, he says, with respect to one of intermediate length,
    "Don't deceive yourself. Do you suppose for a moment the short or
    the long-faced fancier would accept such a bird as a gift?
    Certainly not; the short-faced fancier could see no beauty in it;
    the long-faced fancier would swear there was no use in it, etc." In
    these comical passages, written seriously, we see the principle
    which has ever guided fanciers, and has led to such great
    modifications in all the domestic races which are valued solely for
    their beauty or curiosity.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Fashions in pigeon-breeding endure for long
    periods; we cannot change the structure of a bird as quickly as we
    can the fashion of our dress. In the time of Aldrovandi, no doubt
    the more the pouter inflated his crop, the more he was valued.
    Nevertheless, fashions do to a certain extent change; first one
    point of structure and then another is attended to; or different
    breeds are admired at different times and in different countries.
    As the author just quoted remarks, "the fancy ebbs and flows; a
    thorough fancier now-a-days never stoops to breed toy-birds;" yet
    these very "toys" are now most carefully bred in Germany. Breeds
    which at the present time are highly valued in India are considered
    worthless in England. No doubt, when breeds are neglected, they
    degenerate; still we may believe that, as long as they are kept
    under the same conditions of life, characters once gained will be
    partially retained for a long time, and may form the starting-point
    for a future course of selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Let it not be objected to this view of the
    action of unconscious selection that fanciers would not observe or
    care for extremely slight differences. Those alone who have
    associated with fanciers can be thoroughly aware of their accurate
    powers of discrimination acquired by long practice, and of the care
    and labour which they bestow on their birds. I have known a fancier
    deliberately study his birds day after day to settle which to match
    together and which to reject. Observe how difficult the subject
    appears to one of the most eminent and experienced fanciers. Mr.
    Eaton, the winner of many prizes, says, "I would here particularly
    guard you against keeping too great a variety of pigeons, otherwise
    you will know a little about all the kinds, but nothing about one
    as it ought to be known." "It is possible there may be a few
    fanciers that have a good general knowledge of the several fancy
    pigeons, but there are many who labour under the delusion of
    supposing they know what they do not." Speaking exclusively of one
    sub- variety of one race, namely, the short-faced almond tumbler,
    and after saying that some fanciers sacrifice every property to
    obtain a good head and beak, and that other fanciers sacrifice
    everything for plumage, he remarks: "Some young fanciers who are
    over covetous go in for all the five properties at once, and they
    have their reward by getting nothing." In India, as I hear from Mr.
    Blyth, pigeons are likewise selected and matched with the greatest
    care. We must not judge of the slight divergences from existing
    varieties which would have been valued in ancient days, by those
    which are now valued after the formation of so many races, each
    with its own standard of perfection, kept uniform by our numerous
    Exhibitions. The ambition of the most energetic fancier may be
    fully satisfied by the difficulty of excelling other fanciers in
    the breeds already established, without trying to form a new
    one.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A difficulty with respect to the power of
    selection will perhaps already have occurred to the reader, namely,
    what could have led fanciers first to attempt to make such singular
    breeds as Pouters, Fantails, Carriers, etc.? But it is this very
    difficulty which the principle of unconscious selection removes.
    Undoubtedly no fancier ever did intentionally make such an attempt.
    All that we need suppose is that a variation occurred sufficiently
    marked to catch the discriminating eye of some ancient fancier, and
    then unconscious selection carried on for many generations, that
    is, the wish of succeeding fanciers to excel their rivals, would do
    the rest. In the case of the Fantail we may suppose that the first
    progenitor of the breed had a tail only slightly erected, as may
    now be seen in certain Runts,<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
    with some increase in the number of the tail-feathers, as now
    occasionally occurs with Nuns. In the case of the Pouter we may
    suppose that some bird inflated its crop a little more than other
    pigeons, as is now the case in a slight degree with the
    &#339;esophagus of the Turbit. We do not know the origin of the
    common Tumbler, but we may suppose that a bird was born with some
    affection of the brain, leading it to make somersaults in the
    air;<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> and before the year 1600
    pigeons remarkable for their diversified manner of flight were much
    valued in India, and by the order of the Emperor Akber Khan were
    sedulously trained and carefully matched.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the foregoing cases we have supposed that a
    sudden variation, conspicuous enough to catch a fancier's eye,
    first appeared; but even this degree of abruptness in the process
    of variation is not necessary for the formation of a new breed.
    When the same kind of pigeon has been kept pure, and has been bred
    during a long period by two or more fanciers, slight differences in
    the strain can often be recognised. Thus I have seen first- rate
    Jacobins in one man's possession which certainly differed slightly
    in several characters from those kept by another. I possessed some
    excellent Barbs descended from a pair which had won a prize, and
    another lot descended from a stock formerly kept by that famous
    fancier Sir John Sebright, and these plainly differed in the form
    of the beak; but the differences were so slight that they could
    hardly be given by words. Again, the common English and Dutch
    Tumbler differ in a somewhat greater degree, both in length of beak
    and shape of head. What first caused these slight differences
    cannot be explained any more than why one man has a long nose and
    another a short one. In the strains long kept distinct by different
    fanciers, such differences are so common that they cannot be
    accounted for by the accident of the birds first chosen for
    breeding having been originally as different as they now are. The
    explanation no doubt lies in selection of a slightly different
    nature having been applied in each case; for no two fanciers have
    exactly the same taste, and consequently no two, in choosing and
    carefully matching their birds, prefer or select exactly the same.
    As each man naturally admires his own birds, he goes on continually
    exaggerating by selection whatever slight peculiarities they may
    possess. This will more especially happen with fanciers living in
    different countries, who do not compare their stocks or aim at a
    common standard of perfection. Thus, when a mere strain has once
    been formed, unconscious selection steadily tends to augment the
    amount of difference, and thus converts the strain into a sub-breed
    and this ultimately into a well-marked breed or race.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The principle of correlation of growth should
    never be lost sight of. Most pigeons have small feet, apparently
    caused by their lessened use, and from correlation, as it would
    appear, their beaks have likewise become reduced in length. The
    beak is a conspicuous organ, and, as soon as it had thus become
    perceptibly shortened, fanciers would almost certainly strive to
    reduce it still more by the continued selection of birds with the
    shortest beaks; whilst at the same time other fanciers, as we know
    has actually been the case, would in other sub-breeds, strive to
    increase its length. With the increased length of the beak, the
    tongue becomes greatly lengthened, as do the eyelids with the
    increased development of the eye-wattles; with the reduced or
    increased size of the feet, the number of the scutell&#230; vary;
    with the length of the wing, the number of the primary
    wing-feathers differ; and with the increased length of the body in
    the pouter the number of the sacral vertebr&#230; is augmented.
    These important and correlated differences of structure do not
    invariably characterise any breed; but if they had been attended to
    and selected with as much care as the more conspicuous external
    differences, there can hardly be a doubt that they would have been
    rendered constant. Fanciers could assuredly have made a race of
    Tumblers with nine instead of ten primary wing-feathers, seeing how
    often the number nine appears without any wish on their part, and
    indeed in the case of the white-winged varieties in opposition to
    their wish. In a similar manner, if the vertebr&#230; had been
    visible and had been attended to by fanciers, assuredly an
    additional number might easily have been fixed in the Pouter. If
    these latter characters had once been rendered constant, we should
    never have suspected that they had at first been highly variable,
    or that they had arisen from correlation, in the one case with the
    shortness of the wings, and in the other case with the length of
    the body.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In order to understand how the chief domestic
    races have become distinctly separated from each other, it is
    important to bear in mind, that fanciers constantly try to breed
    from the best birds, and consequently that those which are inferior
    in the requisite qualities are in each generation neglected; so
    that after a time the less improved parent-stocks and many
    subsequently formed intermediate grades become extinct. This has
    occurred in the case of the Pouter, Turbit, and Trumpeter, for
    these highly improved breeds are now left without any links closely
    connecting them either with each other or with the aboriginal
    rock-pigeon. In other countries, indeed, where the same care has
    not been applied, or where the same fashion has not prevailed, the
    earlier forms may long remain unaltered, or altered only in a
    slight degree, and we are thus sometimes enabled to recover the
    connecting links. This is the case in Persia and India with the
    Tumbler and Carrier, which there differ but slightly from the
    rock-pigeon in the proportions of their beaks. So again in Java,
    the Fantail sometimes has only fourteen caudal feathers, and the
    tail is much less elevated and expanded than in our improved birds;
    so that the Java bird forms a link between a first-rate Fantail and
    the rock-pigeon.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Occasionally a breed may be retained for some
    particular quality in a nearly unaltered condition in the same
    country, together with highly modified off-shoots or sub-breeds,
    which are valued for some distinct property. We see this
    exemplified in England, where the common Tumbler, which is valued
    only for its flight, does not differ much from its parent-form, the
    Eastern Tumbler; whereas the Short-faced Tumbler has been
    prodigiously modified, from being valued, not for its flight, but
    for other qualities. But the common-flying Tumbler of Europe has
    already begun to branch out into slightly different sub-breeds,
    such as the common English Tumbler, the Dutch Roller, the Glasgow
    House-tumbler, and the Long-faced Beard Tumbler, etc.; and in the
    course of centuries, unless fashions greatly change, these
    sub-breeds will diverge through the slow and insensible process of
    unconscious selection, and become modified, in a greater and
    greater degree. After a time the perfectly graduated links which
    now connect all these sub-breeds together, will be lost, for there
    would be no object and much difficulty in retaining such a host of
    intermediate sub-varieties.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The principle of divergence, together with the
    extinction of the many previously existing intermediate forms, is
    so important for understanding the origin of domestic races, as
    well as of species in a state of nature, that I will enlarge a
    little more on this subject. Our third main group includes
    Carriers, Barbs, and Runts, which are plainly related to one
    another, yet wonderfully distinct in several important characters.
    According to the view given in the last chapter, these three races
    have probably descended from an unknown race having an intermediate
    character, and this race from the rock-pigeon. Their characteristic
    differences are believed to be due to different breeders having at
    an early period admired different points of structure; and then, on
    the acknowledged principle of admiring extremes, having gone on
    breeding, without any thought of the future, as good birds as they
    could,&#8212;Carrier-fanciers preferring long beaks with much
    wattle,&#8212;Barb-fanciers preferring short thick beaks with much
    eye-wattle,&#8212;and Runt-fanciers not caring about the beak or
    wattle, but only for the size and weight of the body. This process
    would have led to the neglect and final extinction of the earlier,
    inferior, and intermediate birds; and thus it has come to pass,
    that in Europe these three races are now so extraordinarily
    distinct from each other. But in the East, whence they were
    originally brought, the fashion has been different, and we there
    see breeds which connect the highly modified English Carrier with
    the rock-pigeon, and others which to a certain extent connect
    Carriers and Runts. Looking back to the time of Aldrovandi, we find
    that there existed in Europe, before the year 1600, four breeds
    which were closely allied to Carriers and Barbs, but which
    competent authorities cannot now identify with our present Barbs
    and Carriers; nor can Aldrovandi's Runts be identified with our
    present Runts. These four breeds certainly did not differ from each
    other nearly so much as do our existing English Carriers, Barbs,
    and Runts. All this is exactly what might have been anticipated. If
    we could collect all the pigeons which have ever lived, from before
    the time of the Romans to the present day, we should be able to
    group them in several lines, diverging from the parent rock-pigeon.
    Each line would consist of almost insensible steps, occasionally
    broken by some slightly greater variation or sport, and each would
    culminate in one of our present highly modified forms. Of the many
    former connecting links, some would be found to have become
    absolutely extinct without having left any issue, whilst others,
    though extinct, would be recognised as the progenitors of the
    existing races.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have heard it remarked as a strange
    circumstance that we occasionally hear of the local or complete
    extinction of domestic races, whilst we hear nothing of their
    origin. How, it has been asked, can these losses be compensated,
    and more than compensated, for we know that with almost all
    domesticated animals the races have largely increased in number
    since the time of the Romans? But on the view here given, we can
    understand this apparent contradiction. The extinction of a race
    within historical times is an event likely to be noticed; but its
    gradual and scarcely sensible modification through unconscious
    selection, and its subsequent divergence, either in the same or
    more commonly in distant countries, into two or more strains, and
    their gradual conversion into sub-breeds, and these into well-
    marked breeds are events which would rarely be noticed. The death
    of a tree, that has attained gigantic dimensions, is recorded; the
    slow growth of smaller trees and their increase in number excite no
    attention.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In accordance with the belief in the great power
    of selection, and of the little direct power of changed conditions
    of life, except in causing general variability or plasticity of
    organisation, it is not surprising that dovecot-pigeons have
    remained unaltered from time immemorial; and that some toy-pigeons,
    which differ in little else besides colour from the dovecot-pigeon,
    have retained the same character for several centuries. For when
    one of these toy-pigeons had once become beautifully and
    symmetrically coloured,&#8212;when, for instance, a Spot had been
    produced with the crown of its head, its tail, and tail-coverts of
    a uniform colour, the rest of the body being snow-white,&#8212;no
    alteration or improvement would be desired. On the other hand, it
    is not surprising that during this same interval of time our
    highly-bred pigeons have undergone an astonishing amount of change;
    for in regard to them there is no defined limit to the wish of the
    fancier, and there is no known limit to the variability of their
    characters. What is there to stop the fancier desiring to give to
    his Carrier a longer and longer beak, or to his Tumbler a shorter
    and shorter beak? nor has the extreme limit of variability in the
    beak, if there be any such limit, as yet been reached.
    Notwithstanding the great improvement effected within recent times
    in the Short-faced Almond Tumbler, Mr. Eaton remarks, "the field is
    still as open for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years
    ago;" but this is perhaps an exaggerated assertion, for the young
    of all highly-improved fancy birds are extremely liable to disease
    and death.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have heard it objected that the formation of
    the several domestic races of the pigeon throws no light on the
    origin of the wild species of the Columbid&#230;, because their
    differences are not of the same nature. The domestic races, for
    instance do not differ, or differ hardly at all, in the relative
    lengths and shape of the primary wing-feathers, in the relative
    length of the hind toe, or in habits of life, as in roosting and
    building in trees. But the above objection shows how completely the
    principle of selection has been misunderstood. It is not likely
    that characters selected by the caprice of man should resemble
    differences preserved under natural conditions either from being of
    direct service to each species, or from standing in correlation
    with other modified and serviceable structures. Until man selects
    birds differing in the relative length of the wing-feathers or
    toes, etc., no sensible change in these parts should be expected.
    Nor could man do anything unless these parts happened to vary under
    domestication: I do not positively assert that this is the case,
    although I have seen traces of such variability in the
    wing-feathers, and certainly in the tail-feathers. It would be a
    strange fact if the relative length of the hind toe should never
    vary, seeing how variable the foot is both in size and in the
    number of the scutell&#230;. With respect to the domestic races not
    roosting or building in trees, it is obvious that fanciers would
    never attend to or select such changes in habits; but we have seen
    that the pigeons in Egypt, which do not for some reason like
    settling on the low mud hovels of the natives, are led, apparently
    by compulsion, to perch in crowds on the trees. We may even affirm
    that, if our domestic races had become greatly modified in any of
    the above specified respects, and it could be shown that fanciers
    had never attended to such points, or that they did not stand in
    correlation with other selected characters, the fact, on the
    principles advocated in this chapter, would have offered a serious
    difficulty.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Let us briefly sum up the last two chapters on
    the pigeon. We may conclude with confidence that all the domestic
    races, notwithstanding their great amount of difference, are
    descended from the <I>Columba livia,</I> including under this name
    certain wild races. But the differences between the latter throw no
    light whatever on the characters which distinguish the domestic
    races. In each breed or sub-breed the individual birds are more
    variable than birds in a state of nature; and occasionally they
    vary in a sudden and strongly-marked manner. This plasticity of
    organisation apparently results from changed conditions of life.
    Disuse has reduced certain parts of the body. Correlation of growth
    so ties the organisation together, that when one part varies other
    parts vary at the same time. When several breeds have once been
    formed, their intercrossing aids the progress of modification, and
    has even produced new sub-breeds. But as, in the construction of a
    building, mere stones or bricks are of little avail without the
    builder's art, so, in the production of new races, selection has
    been the presiding power. Fanciers can act by selection on
    excessively slight individual differences, as well as on those
    greater differences which are called sports. Selection is followed
    methodically when the fancier tries to improve and modify a breed
    according to a prefixed standard of excellence; or he acts
    unmethodically and unconsciously, by merely trying to rear as good
    birds as he can, without any wish or intention to alter the breed.
    The progress of selection almost inevitably leads to the neglect
    and ultimate extinction of the earlier and less improved forms, as
    well as of many intermediate links in each long line of descent.
    Thus it has come to pass that most of our present races are so
    marvellously distinct from each other, and from the aboriginal
    rock-pigeon.</P>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">I have drawn out a long table of the various crosses made by
      fanciers between the several domestic breeds but I do not think
      it worth while publishing. I have myself made for this special
      purpose many crosses, and all were perfectly fertile. I have
      united in one bird five of the most distinct races, and with
      patience I might undoubtedly have thus united all. The case of
      five distinct breeds being blended together with unimpaired
      fertility is important, because G&#228;rtner has shown that it is
      a very general, though not, as he thought, universal rule, that
      complex crosses between several species are excessively sterile.
      I have met with only two or three cases of reported sterility in
      the offspring of certain races when crossed. Pistor ('Das Ganze
      der Feldtaubenzucht,' 1831, s. 15) asserts that the mongrels from
      Barbs and Fantails are sterile: I have proved this to be
      erroneous, not only by crossing those hybrids with several other
      hybrids of the same parentage, but by the more severe test of
      pairing brother and sister hybrids <I>inter se,</I> and they were
      <I>perfectly</I> fertile. Temminck has stated ('Hist. Nat.
      G&#233;n. des Pigeons,' tom. i. p. 197) that the Turbit or Owl
      will not cross readily with other breeds: but my Turbits crossed,
      when left free with Almond Tumblers and with Trumpeters; the same
      thing has occurred (Rev. E. S. Dixon, 'The Dovecote,' p. 107)
      between Turbits and Dovecots and Nuns. I have crossed Turbits
      with Barbs, as has M. Boitard (p. 34), who says the hybrids were
      very fertile. Hybrids from a Turbit and Fantail have been known
      to breed <I>inter se</I> (Riedel, 'Taubenzucht,' s. 25, and
      Bechstein, 'Naturgesch. Deutsch.,' B. iv. s. 44. Turbits (Riedel,
      s. 26) have been crossed with Pouters and with Jacobins, and with
      a hybrid Jacobin-trumpeter (Riedel, s. 27). The latter author
      has, however, made some vague statements (s. 22) on the sterility
      of Turbits when crossed with certain other crossed breeds. But I
      have little doubt that the Rev. E. S. Dixon's explanation of such
      statements is correct, viz. that individual birds both with
      Turbits and other breeds are occasionally sterile.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">Domestic pigeons pair readily with the allied <I>C.
      &#156;nas</I> (Bechstein, 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands,' B. iv. s.
      3); and Mr. Brent has made the same cross several times in
      England, but the young were very apt to die at about ten days
      old; one hybrid which he reared (from <I>C. &#156;nas</I> and a
      male Antwerp Carrier) paired with a Dragon, but never laid eggs.
      Bechstein further states (s. 26) that the domestic pigeon will
      cross with <I>C. palumbus, Turtur risoria,</I> and <I>T.
      vulgaris,</I> but nothing is said of the fertility of the
      hybrids, and this would have been mentioned had the fact been
      ascertained. In the Zoological Gardens (MS. report to me from Mr.
      James Hunt) a male hybrid from <I>Turtur vulgaris</I> and a
      domestic pigeon "paired with several different species of pigeons
      and doves, but none of the eggs were good." Hybrids from <I>C.
      &#156;nas</I> and <I>gymnophthalmos</I> were sterile. In Loudon's
      'Mag. of Nat. Hist.,' vol. vii. 1834, p. 154, it is said that a
      male hybrid (from <I>Turtur vulgaris</I> male, and the
      cream-coloured <I>T. risoria</I> female) paired during two years
      with a female <I>T. risoria,</I> and the latter laid many eggs,
      but all were sterile. MM. Boitard and Corbi&#233; ('Les Pigeons,'
      p. 235) state that the hybrids from these two turtle-doves are
      invariably sterile both <I>inter se</I> and with either pure
      parent. The experiment was tried by M. Corbi&#233; "avec une
      esp&#232;ce d'obstination;" and likewise by M. Mauduyt, and by M.
      Vieillot. Temminck also found the hybrids from these two species
      quite barren. Therefore, when Bechstein ('Naturgesch.
      Deutschlands V&#246;gel,' B. iv. s. 101) asserts that the hybrids
      from these two turtle-doves propagate <I>inter se</I> equally
      well with pure species, and when a writer in the 'Field'
      newspaper (in a letter dated Nov. 10th, 1858) makes a similar
      assertion, it would appear that there must be some mistake;
      though what the mistake is I know not, as Bechstein at least must
      have known the white <I>variety</I> of <I>T. risoria</I>: it
      would be an unparalleled fact if the same two species sometimes
      produced <I>extremely</I> fertile, and sometimes <I>extremely</I>
      barren, offspring. In the MS. report from the Zoological Gardens
      it is said that hybrids from <I>Turtur vulgaris</I> and <I>
      suratensis,</I> and from <I>T. vulgaris</I> and <I>Ectopistes
      migratorius,</I> were sterile. Two of the latter male hybrids
      paired with their pure parents, viz. <I>Turtur vulgaris</I> and
      the Ectopistes, and likewise with <I>T. risoria</I> and with <I>
      Columba &#156;nas,</I> and many eggs were produced, but all were
      barren. At Paris, hybrids have been raised (Isid. Geoffrey
      Saint-Hilaire, 'Hist. Nat. G&#233;n&#233;rale,' tom. iii. p. 180)
      from <I>Turtur auritus</I> with <I>T. cambayensis</I> and with
      <I>T. suratensis</I>; but nothing is said of their fertility. At
      the Zoological Gardens of London the <I>Goura coronata</I> and
      <I>victori&#230;</I> produced a hybrid which paired with the pure
      <I>G. coronata,</I> and laid several eggs, but these proved
      barren. In 1860 <I>Columba gymnophthalmos</I> and <I>maculosa</I>
      produced hybrids in these same gardens.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">There is one exception to the rule, namely, in a sub-variety
      of the Swallow of German origin, which is figured by Neumeister,
      and was shown to me by Mr. Wicking. This bird is blue, but has
      not the black wing-bars; for our object, however, in tracing the
      descent of the chief races, this exception signifies the less as
      the Swallow approaches closely in structure to <I>C. livia.</I>
      In many sub-varieties the black bars are replaced by bars of
      various colours. The figures given by Neumeister are sufficient
      to show that, if the wings alone are blue, the black wing-bars
      appear.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">I have observed blue birds with all the above-mentioned marks
      in the following races, which seemed to be perfectly pure, and
      were shown at various exhibitions. Pouters, with the double black
      wing-bars, with white croup, dark bar to end of tail, and white
      edging to outer tail-feathers. Turbits, with all these same
      characters. Fantails with the same; but the croup in some was
      bluish or pure blue. Mr. Wicking bred blue Fantails from two
      black birds. Carriers (including the Bagadotten of Neumeister)
      with all the marks: two birds which I examined had white, and two
      had blue croups; the white edging to the outer tail-feathers was
      not present in all. Mr. Corker, a great breeder, assures me that,
      if black carriers are matched for many successive generations,
      the offspring become first ash-coloured, and then blue with black
      wing-bars. Runts of the elongated breed had the same marks, but
      the croup was pale blue; the outer tail-feathers had white edges.
      Neumeister figures the great Florence Runt of a blue colour with
      black bars. Jacobins are very rarely blue, but I have received
      authentic accounts of at least two instances of the blue variety
      with black bars having appeared in England; blue Jacobins were
      bred by Mr. Brent from two black birds. I have seen common
      Tumblers, both Indian and English, and Short-faced Tumblers, of a
      blue colour, with black wing-bars, with the black bar at the end
      of the tail, and with the outer tail-feathers edged with white;
      the croup in all was blue, or extremely pale blue, never
      absolutely white. Blue Barbs and Trumpeters seem to be
      excessively rare; but Neumeister, who may be implicitly trusted,
      figures blue varieties of both, with black wing-bars. Mr. Brent
      informs me that he has seen a blue Barb; and Mr. H. Weir, as I am
      informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, once bred a silver (which means very
      pale blue) Barb from two yellow birds.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">Mr. Blyth informs me that all the domestic races in India
      have the croup blue; but this is not invariable, for I possess a
      very pale blue Simmali pigeon with the croup perfectly white,
      sent to me by Sir W. Elliot from Madras. A slaty-blue and
      chequered Nakshi pigeon has some white feathers on the croup
      alone. In some other Indian pigeons there were a few white
      feathers confined to the croup, and I have noticed the same fact
      in a carrier from Persia. The Java Fantail (imported into Amoy,
      and thence sent me) has a perfectly white croup.</FONT></LI>

      of India ('Indian Medical Gazette,' Jan. and Feb. 1873), and says

      together with strychnine, to an ordinary pigeon, brings on

      ever afterwards occasionally made somersaults.</FONT></LI>
