    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the last two chapters the nature and force of
    Inheritance, the circumstances which interfere with its power, and
    the tendency to Reversion, with its many remarkable contingencies,
    were discussed. In the present chapter some other related phenomena
    will be treated of, as fully as my materials permit.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Fixedness of Character.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is a general belief amongst breeders that the
    longer any character has been transmitted by a breed, the more
    fully it will continue to be transmitted. I do not wish to dispute
    the truth of the proposition that inheritance gains strength simply
    through long continuance, but I doubt whether it can be proved. In
    one sense the proposition is little better than a truism; if any
    character has remained constant during many generations, it will be
    likely to continue so, if the conditions of life remain the same.
    So, again, in improving a breed, if care be taken for a length of
    time to exclude all inferior individuals, the breed will obviously
    tend to become truer, as it will not have been crossed during many
    generations by an inferior animal. We have previously seen, but
    without being able to assign any cause, that, when a new character
    appears, it is occasionally from the first constant, or fluctuates
    much, or wholly fails to be transmitted. So it is with the
    aggregate of slight differences which characterise a new variety,
    for some propagate their kind from the first much truer than
    others. Even with plants multiplied by bulbs, layers, etc., which
    may in one sense be said to form parts of the same individual, it
    is well known that certain varieties retain and transmit through
    successive bud-generations their newly-acquired characters more
    truly than others. In none of these, nor in the following cases,
    does there appear to be any relation between the force with which a
    character is transmitted and the length of time during which it has
    been transmitted. Some varieties, such as white and yellow
    hyacinths and white sweet-peas, transmit their colours more
    faithfully than do the varieties which have retained their natural
    colour. In the Irish family, mentioned in the twelfth chapter, the
    peculiar tortoiseshell-like colouring of the eyes was transmitted
    far more faithfully than any ordinary colour. Ancon and Mauchamp
    sheep and niata cattle, which are all comparatively modern breeds,
    exhibit remarkably strong powers of inheritance. Many similar cases
    could be adduced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As all domesticated animals and cultivated
    plants have varied, and yet are descended from aboriginally wild
    forms, which no doubt had retained the same character from an
    immensely remote epoch, we see that scarcely any degree of
    antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly true. In
    this case, however, it may be said that changed conditions of life
    induce certain modifications, and not that the power of inheritance
    fails; but in every case of failure, some cause, either internal or
    external, must interfere. It will generally be found that the
    organs or parts which in our domesticated productions have varied,
    or which still continue to vary,&#8212;that is, which fail to
    retain their former state,&#8212;are the same with the parts which
    differ in the natural species of the same genus. As, on the theory
    of descent with modification, the species of the same genus have
    been modified since they branched off from a common progenitor, it
    follows that the characters by which they differ from one another
    have varied, whilst other parts of the organisation have remained
    unchanged; and it might be argued that these same characters now
    vary under domestication, or fail to be inherited, from their
    lesser antiquity. But variation in a state of nature seems to stand
    in some close relation with changed conditions of life, and
    characters which have already varied under such conditions would be
    apt to vary under the still greater changes consequent on
    domestication, independently of their greater or less
    antiquity.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Fixedness of character, or the strength of
    inheritance, has often been judged of by the preponderance of
    certain characters in the crossed offspring between distinct races;
    but prepotency of transmission here comes into play, and this, as
    we shall immediately see, is a very different consideration from
    the strength or weakness of inheritance.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> It has often been observed that breeds of
    animals inhabiting wild and mountainous countries cannot be
    permanently modified by our improved breeds; and as these latter
    are of modern origin, it has been thought that the greater
    antiquity of the wilder breeds has been the cause of their
    resistance to improvement by crossing; but it is more probably due
    to their structure and constitution being better adapted to the
    surrounding conditions. When plants are first subjected to culture,
    it has been found that, during several generations, they transmit
    their characters truly, that is, do not vary, and this has been
    attributed to ancient characters being strongly inherited: but it
    may with equal or greater probability be consequent on changed
    conditions of life requiring a long time for their cumulative
    action. Notwithstanding these considerations, it would perhaps be
    rash to deny that characters become more strongly fixed the longer
    they are transmitted; but I believe that the proposition resolves
    itself into this,&#8212;that characters of all kinds, whether new
    or old, tend to be inherited, and that those which have already
    withstood all counteracting influences and been truly transmitted,
    will, as a general rule, continue to withstand them, and
    consequently be faithfully inherited.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Prepotency in the Transmission of Character.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When individuals, belonging to the same family,
    but distinct enough to be recognised, or when two well-marked
    races, or two species, are crossed, the usual result, as stated in
    the previous chapter, is, that the offspring in the first
    generation are intermediate between their parents, or resemble one
    parent in one part and the other parent in another part. But this
    is by no means the invariable rule; for in many cases it is found
    that certain individuals, races, and species, are prepotent in
    transmitting their likeness. This subject has been ably discussed
    by Prosper Lucas,<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> but is rendered
    extremely complex by the prepotency sometimes running equally in
    both sexes, and sometimes more strongly in one sex than in the
    other; it is likewise complicated by the presence of secondary
    sexual characters, which render the comparison of crossed breeds
    with their parents difficult.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It would appear that in certain families some
    one ancestor, and after him others in the same family, have had
    great power in transmitting their likeness through the male line;
    for we cannot otherwise understand how the same features should so
    often be transmitted after marriages with many females, as in the
    case of the Austrian Emperors; and so it was, according to Niebuhr,
    with the mental qualities of certain Roman families.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> The famous bull Favourite is believed<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> to have had a prepotent influence on
    the shorthorn race. It has also been observed<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> with English racehorses that certain
    mares have generally transmitted their own character, whilst other
    mares of equally pure blood have allowed the character of the sire
    to prevail. A famous black greyhound, Bedlamite, as I hear from Mr.
    C. M. Brown "invariably got all his puppies black, no matter what
    was the colour of the bitch;" but then Bedlamite "had a
    preponderance of black in his blood, both on the sire and dam
    side."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The truth of the principle of prepotency
    comes out more clearly when distinct races are crossed. The
    improved Shorthorns, notwithstanding that the breed is
    comparatively modern, are generally acknowledged to possess great
    power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds; and it is
    chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly valued
    for exportation.<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Godine has given
    a curious case of a ram of a goat-like breed of sheep from the Cape
    of Good Hope, which produced offspring hardly to be distinguished
    from himself, when crossed with ewes of twelve other breeds. But
    two of these half-bred ewes, when put to a merino ram, produced
    lambs closely resembling the merino breed. Girou de Buzareingues<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> found that of two races of French
    sheep the ewes of one, when crossed during successive generations
    with merino rams, yielded up their character far sooner than the
    ewes of the other race. Sturm and Girou have given analogous cases
    with other breeds of sheep and with cattle, the prepotency running
    in these cases through the male side; but I was assured on good
    authority in South America, that when niata cattle are crossed with
    common cattle, though the niata breed is prepotent whether males or
    females are used, yet that the prepotency is strongest through the
    female line. The Manx cat is tailless and has long hind legs; Dr.
    Wilson crossed a male Manx with common cats, and, out of
    twenty-three kittens, seventeen were destitute of tails; but when
    the female Manx was crossed by common male cats all the kittens had
    tails, though they were generally short and imperfect.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In making reciprocal crosses between
    pouter and fantail pigeons, the pouter-race seemed to be prepotent
    through both sexes over the fantail. But this is probably due to
    weak power in the fantail rather than to any unusually strong power
    in the pouter, for I have observed that barbs also preponderate
    over fantails. This weakness of transmission in the fantail, though
    the breed is an ancient one, is said<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> to be general; but I have observed one
    exception to the rule, namely, in a cross between a fantail and
    laugher. The most curious instance known to me of weak power in
    both sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon. This breed has been well
    known for at least 130 years: it breeds perfectly true, as I have
    been assured by those who have long kept many birds: it is
    characterised by a peculiar tuft of feathers over the beak, by a
    crest on the head, by a singular coo quite unlike that of any other
    breed, and by much-feathered feet. I have crossed both sexes with
    turbits of two sub-breeds, with almond tumblers, spots, and runts,
    and reared many mongrels and recrossed them; and though the crest
    on the head and feathered feet were inherited (as is generally the
    case with most breeds), I have never seen a vestige of the tuft
    over the beak or heard the peculiar coo. Boitard and Corbi&#233;<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> assert that this is the invariable
    result of crossing trumpeters with other breeds: Neumeister,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> however, states that in Germany
    mongrels have been obtained, though very rarely, which were
    furnished with the tuft and would trumpet: but a pair of these
    mongrels with a tuft, which I imported, never trumpeted. Mr. Brent
    states<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> that the crossed offspring
    of a trumpeter were crossed with trumpeters for three generations,
    by which time the mongrels had 7/8ths of this blood in their veins,
    yet the tuft over the beak did not appear. At the fourth generation
    the tuft appeared, but the birds though now having 15-16ths
    trumpeter's blood still did not trumpet. This case well shows the
    wide difference between inheritance and prepotency; for here we
    have a well-established old race which transmits its characters
    faithfully, but which, when crossed with any other race, has the
    feeblest power of transmitting its two chief characteristic
    qualities.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will give one other instance with fowls
    and pigeons of weakness and strength in the transmission of the
    same character to their crossed offspring. The Silk fowl breeds
    true, and there is reason to believe is a very ancient race; but
    when I reared a large number of mongrels from a Silk hen by a
    Spanish cock, not one exhibited even a trace of the so-called
    silkiness. Mr. Hewitt also asserts that in no instance are the
    silky feathers transmitted by this breed when crossed with any
    other variety. But three birds out of many raised by Mr. Orton from
    a cross between a silk cock and a bantam hen had silky feathers.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> So that it is certain that this
    breed very seldom has the power of transmitting its peculiar
    plumage to its crossed progeny. On the other hand, there is a silk
    sub-variety of the fantail pigeon, which has its feathers in nearly
    the same state as in the Silk fowl: now we have already seen that
    fantails, when crossed, possess singularly weak power in
    transmitting their general qualities; but the silk sub-variety when
    crossed with any other small-sized race invariably transmits its
    silky feathers!<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The well-known horticulturist, Mr. Paul,
    informs me that he fertilised the Black Prince hollyhock with
    pollen of the White Globe and the Lemonade and Black Prince
    hollyhocks reciprocally; but not one seedling from these three
    crosses inherited the black colour of the Black Prince. So, again,
    Mr. Laxton, who has had such great experience in crossing peas,
    writes to me that "whenever a cross has been effected between a
    white-blossomed and a purple-blossomed pea, or between a
    white-seeded and a purple-spotted, brown or maple-seeded pea, the
    offspring seems to lose nearly all the characteristics of the
    white-flowered and white-seeded varieties; and this result follows
    whether these varieties have been used as the pollen-bearing or
    seed-producing parents."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The law of prepotency comes into action
    when species are crossed, as with races and individuals.
    G&#228;rtner has unequivocally shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> that this is the case with plants. To
    give one instance: when <I>Nicotiana paniculata</I> and <I>
    vinc&#230;flora</I> are crossed, the character of <I>N.
    paniculata</I> is almost completely lost in the hybrid; but if <I>
    N. quadrivalvis</I> be crossed with <I>N. vinc&#230;flora,</I> this
    latter species, which was before so prepotent, now in its turn
    almost disappears under the power of <I>N. quadrivalvis.</I> It is
    remarkable that the prepotency of one species over another in
    transmission is quite independent, as shown by G&#228;rtner, of the
    greater or less facility with which the one fertilises the
    other.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With animals, the jackal is prepotent
    over the dog, as is stated by Flourens, who made many crosses
    between these animals; and this was likewise the case with a hybrid
    which I once saw between a jackal and a terrier. I cannot doubt,
    from the observations of Colin and others, that the ass is
    prepotent over the horse; the prepotency in this instance running
    more strongly through the male than through the female ass; so that
    the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the hinny.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> The male pheasant, judging from Mr.
    Hewitt's descriptions,<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> and from
    the hybrids which I have seen, preponderates over the domestic
    fowl; but the latter, as far as colour is concerned, has
    considerable power of transmission, for hybrids raised from five
    differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage. I formerly
    examined some curious hybrids in the Zoological Gardens, between
    the Penguin variety of the common duck and the Egyptian goose
    (<I>Anser &#230;gyptiacus</I>); and although I will not assert that
    the domesticated variety preponderated over the natural species,
    yet it had strongly impressed its unnatural upright figure on these
    hybrids.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I am aware that such cases as the
    foregoing have been ascribed by various authors, not to one
    species, race, or individual being prepotent over the other in
    impressing its character on its crossed offspring, but to such
    rules as that the father influences the external characters and the
    mother the internal or vital organs. But the great diversity of the
    rules given by various authors almost proves their falseness. Dr.
    Prosper Lucas has fully discussed this point, and has shown<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> that none of the rules (and I could add
    others to those quoted by him) apply to all animals. Similar rules
    have been announced for plants, and have been proved by
    G&#228;rtner<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> to be all erroneous.
    If we confine our view to the domesticated races of a single
    species, or perhaps even to the species of the same genus, some
    such rules may hold good; for instance, it seems that in
    reciprocally crossing various breeds of fowls the male generally
    gives colour;<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> but conspicuous
    exceptions have passed under my own eyes. It seems that the ram
    usually gives its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed
    offspring, and the bull the presence or absence of
    horns.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the following chapter on Crossing I
    shall have occasion to show that certain characters are rarely or
    never blended by crossing, but are transmitted in an unmodified
    state from either parent-form; I refer to this fact here because it
    is sometimes accompanied on the one side by prepotency, which thus
    acquires the false appearance of unusual strength. In the same
    chapter I shall show that the rate at which a species or breed
    absorbs and obliterates another by repeated crosses, depends in
    chief part on prepotency in transmission.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, some of the cases above
    given,&#8212;for instance, that of the trumpeter
    pigeon,&#8212;prove that there is a wide difference between mere
    inheritance and prepotency. This latter power seems to us, in our
    ignorance, to act in most cases quite capriciously. The very same
    character, even though it be an abnormal or monstrous one, such as
    silky feathers, may be transmitted by different species, when
    crossed, either with prepotent force or singular feebleness. It is
    obvious, that a purely-bred form of either sex, in all cases in
    which prepotency does not run more strongly in one sex than the
    other, will transmit its character with prepotent force over a
    mongrelised and already variable form.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> From several of the above-given cases we
    may conclude that mere antiquity of character does not by any means
    necessarily make it prepotent. In some cases prepotency apparently
    depends on the same character being present and visible in one of
    the two breeds which are crossed, and latent or invisible in the
    other breed; and in this case it is natural that the character
    which is potentially present in both breeds should be prepotent.
    Thus, we have reason to believe that there is a latent tendency in
    all horses to be dun-coloured and striped; and when a horse of this
    kind is crossed with one of any other colour, it is said that the
    offspring are almost sure to be striped. Sheep have a similar
    latent tendency to become dark-coloured, and we have seen with what
    prepotent force a ram with a few black spots, when crossed with
    white sheep of various breeds, coloured its offspring. All pigeons
    have a latent tendency to become slaty-blue, with certain
    characteristic marks, and it is known that, when a bird thus
    coloured is crossed with one of any other colour, it is most
    difficult afterwards to eradicate the blue tint. A nearly parallel
    case is offered by those black bantams which, as they grow old,
    develop a latent tendency to acquire red feathers. But there are
    exceptions to the rule: hornless breeds of cattle possess a latent
    capacity to reproduce horns, yet when crossed with horned breeds
    they do not invariably produce offspring bearing horns.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We meet with analogous cases with plants.
    Striped flowers, though they can be propagated truly by seed, have
    a latent tendency to become uniformly coloured, but when once
    crossed by a uniformly coloured variety, they ever afterwards fail
    to produce striped seedlings.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
    Another case is in some respects more curious: plants bearing
    peloric flowers have so strong a latent tendency to reproduce their
    normally irregular flowers, that this often occurs by buds when a
    plant is transplanted into poorer or richer soil.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> Now I crossed the peloric snapdragon
    (<I>Antirrhinum majus</I>), described in the last chapter, with
    pollen of the common form; and the latter, reciprocally, with
    peloric pollen. I thus raised two great beds of seedlings, and not
    one was peloric. Naudin<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> obtained
    the same result from crossing a peloric Linaria with the common
    form. I carefully examined the flowers of ninety plants of the
    crossed Antirrhinum in the two beds, and their structure had not
    been in the least affected by the cross, except that in a few
    instances the minute rudiment of the fifth stamen, which is always
    present, was more fully or even completely developed. It must not
    be supposed that this entire obliteration of the peloric structure
    in the crossed plants can be accounted for by any incapacity of
    transmission; for I raised a large bed of plants from the peloric
    Antirrhinum, artificially fertilised by its own pollen, and sixteen
    plants, which alone survived the winter, were all as perfectly
    peloric as the parent-plant. Here we have a good instance of the
    wide difference between the inheritance of a character and the
    power of transmitting it to crossed offspring. The crossed plants,
    which perfectly resembled the common snapdragon, were allowed to
    sow themselves, and out of a hundred and twenty-seven seedlings,
    eighty-eight proved to be common snapdragons, two were in an
    intermediate condition between the peloric and normal state, and
    thirty-seven were perfectly peloric, having reverted to the
    structure of their one grand-parent. This case seems at first sight
    to offer an exception to the rule just given, namely, that a
    character which is present in one form and latent in the other is
    generally transmitted with prepotent force when the two forms are
    crossed. For in all the Scrophulariace&#230;, and especially in the
    genera Antirrhinum and Linaria, there is, as was shown in the last
    chapter, a strong latent tendency to become peloric; but there is
    also, as we have seen, a still stronger tendency in all peloric
    plants to reacquire their normal irregular structure. So that we
    have two opposed latent tendencies in the same plants. Now, with
    the crossed Antirrhinums the tendency to produce normal or
    irregular flowers, like those of the common Snapdragon, prevailed
    in the first generation; whilst the tendency to pelorism, appearing
    to gain strength by the intermission of a generation, prevailed to
    a large extent in the second set of seedlings. How it is possible
    for a character to gain strength by the intermission of a
    generation, will be considered in the chapter on pangenesis.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the whole, the subject of prepotency is
    extremely intricate,&#8212;from its varying so much in strength,
    even in regard to the same character, in different
    animals,&#8212;from its running either equally in both sexes, or,
    as frequently is the case with animals, but not with plants, much
    stronger in one sex than the other,&#8212;from the existence of
    secondary sexual characters,&#8212;from the transmission of certain
    characters being limited, as we shall immediately see, by
    sex,&#8212;from certain characters not blending
    together,&#8212;and, perhaps, occasionally from the effects of a
    previous fertilisation on the mother. It is therefore not
    surprising that no one has hitherto succeeded in drawing up general
    rules on the subject of prepotency.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Inheritance as limited by Sex.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">New characters often appear in one sex, and are
    afterwards transmitted to the same sex, either exclusively or in a
    much greater degree than to the other. This subject is important,
    because with animals of many kinds in a state of nature, both high
    and low in the scale, secondary sexual characters, not directly
    connected with the organs of reproduction, are conspicuously
    present. With our domesticated animals, characters of this kind
    often differ widely from those distinguishing the two sexes of the
    parent species; and the principle of inheritance, as limited by
    sex, explains how this is possible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Dr. P. Lucas has shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> that when a peculiarity, in no manner
    connected with the reproductive organs, appears in either parent,
    it is often transmitted exclusively to the offspring of the same
    sex, or to a much greater number of them than of the opposite sex.
    Thus, in the family of Lambert, the horn-like projections on the
    skin were transmitted from the father to his sons and grandsons
    alone; so it has been with other cases of ichthyosis, with
    supernumerary digits, with a deficiency of digits and phalanges,
    and in a lesser degree with various diseases, especially with
    colour-blindness and the h&#230;morrhagic diathesis, that is, an
    extreme liability to profuse and uncontrollable bleeding from
    trifling wounds. On the other hand, mothers have transmitted,
    during several generations, to their daughters alone, supernumerary
    and deficient digits, colour-blindness and other peculiarities. So
    that the very same peculiarity may become attached to either sex,
    and be long inherited by that sex alone; but the attachment in
    certain cases is much more frequent to one than the other sex. The
    same peculiarities also may be promiscuously transmitted to either
    sex. Dr. Lucas gives other cases, showing that the male
    occasionally transmits his peculiarities to his daughters alone,
    and the mother to her sons alone; but even in this case we see that
    inheritance is to a certain extent, though inversely, regulated by
    sex. Dr. Lucas, after weighing the whole evidence, comes to the
    conclusion that every peculiarity tends to be transmitted in a
    greater or lesser degree to that sex in which it first appears. But
    a more definite rule, as I have elsewhere shown<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> generally holds good, namely, that
    variations which first appear in either sex at a late period of
    life, when the reproductive functions are active, tend to be
    developed in that sex alone; whilst variations which first appear
    early in life in either sex are commonly transmitted to both sexes.
    I am, however, far from supposing that this is the sole determining
    cause.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>A few details from the many cases
    collected by Mr. Sedgwick,<A href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> may be
    here given. Colour-blindness, from some unknown cause, shows itself
    much oftener in males than in females; in upwards of two hundred
    cases collected by Mr. Sedgwick, nine-tenths related to men; but it
    is eminently liable to be transmitted through women. In the case
    given by Dr. Earle, members of eight related families were affected
    during five generations: these families consisted of sixty-one
    individuals, namely, of thirty-two males, of whom nine-sixteenths
    were incapable of distinguishing colour, and of twenty-nine
    females, of whom only one-fifteenth were thus affected. Although
    colour-blindness thus generally clings to the male sex,
    nevertheless, in one instance in which it first appeared in a
    female, it was transmitted during five generations to thirteen
    individuals, all of whom were females. The h&#230;morrhagic
    diathesis, often accompanied by rheumatism, has been known to
    affect the males alone during five generations, being transmitted,
    however, through the females. It is said that deficient phalanges
    in the fingers have been inherited by the females alone during ten
    generations. In another case, a man thus deficient in both hands
    and feet, transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one
    daughter; but in the third generation,&#8212;out of nineteen
    grandchildren, twelve sons had the family defect, whilst the seven
    daughters were free. In ordinary cases of sexual limitation, the
    sons or daughters inherit the peculiarity, whatever it may be, from
    their father or mother, and transmit it to their children of the
    same sex; but generally with the h&#230;morrhagic diathesis, and
    often with colour-blindness, and in some other cases, the sons
    never inherit the peculiarity directly from their fathers, but the
    daughters alone transmit the latent tendency, so that the sons of
    the daughters alone exhibit it. Thus the father, grandson, and
    great-great-grandson will exhibit a peculiarity,&#8212;the
    grandmother, daughter, and great-grand-daughter having transmitted
    it in a latent state. Hence we have, as Mr. Sedgwick remarks, a
    double kind of atavism or reversion; each grandson apparently
    receiving and developing the peculiarity from his grandfather, and
    each daughter apparently receiving the latent tendency from her
    grandmother.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From the various facts recorded by Dr.
    Prosper Lucas, Mr. Sedgwick, and others, there can be no doubt that
    peculiarities first appearing in either sex, though not in any way
    necessarily or invariably connected with that sex, strongly tend to
    be inherited by the offspring of the same sex, but are often
    transmitted in a latent state through the opposite sex.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Turning now to domesticated animals, we
    find that certain characters not proper to the parent species are
    often confined to, and inherited by, one sex alone; but we do not
    know the history of the first appearance of such characters. In the
    chapter on Sheep, we have seen that the males of certain races
    differ greatly from the females in the shape of their horns, these
    being absent in the ewes of some breeds; they differ also in the
    development of fat in the tail and in the outline of the forehead.
    These differences, judging from the character of the allied wild
    species, cannot be accounted for by supposing that they have been
    derived from distinct parent forms. There is, also, a great
    difference between the horns of the two sexes in one Indian breed
    of goats. The bull zebu is said to have a larger hump than the cow.
    In the Scotch deer-hound the two sexes differ in size more than in
    any other variety of the dog<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> and,
    judging from analogy, more than in the aboriginal parent-species.
    The peculiar colour called tortoise-shell is very rarely seen in a
    male cat; the males of this variety being of a rusty
    tint.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In various breeds of the fowl the males
    and females often differ greatly; and these differences are far
    from being the same with those which distinguish the two sexes of
    the parent-species, the <I>Gallus bankiva</I>; and consequently
    have originated under domestication. In certain sub-varieties of
    the Game race we have the unusual case of the hens differing from
    each other more than the cocks. In an Indian breed of a white
    colour shaded with black, the hens invariably have black skins, and
    their bones are covered by a black periosteum, whilst the cocks are
    never or most rarely thus characterised. Pigeons offer a more
    interesting case; for throughout the whole great family the two
    sexes do not often differ much; and the males and females of the
    parent-form, the <I>C. livia,</I> are undistinguishable: yet we
    have seen that with pouters the male has the characteristic quality
    of pouting more strongly developed than the female; and in certain
    sub-varieties the males alone are spotted or striated with black,
    or otherwise differ in colour. When male and female English
    carrier-pigeons are exhibited in separate pens, the difference in
    the development of the wattle over the beak and round the eyes is
    conspicuous. So that here we have instances of the appearance of
    secondary sexual characters in the domesticated races of a species
    in which such differences are naturally quite absent.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, secondary sexual characters
    which belong to the species in a state of nature are sometimes
    quite lost, or greatly diminished, under domestication. We see this
    in the small size of the tusks in our improved breeds of the pig,
    in comparison with those of the wild boar. There are sub-breeds of
    fowls, in which the males have lost the fine-flowing tail-feathers
    and hackles; and others in which there is no difference in colour
    between the two sexes. In some cases the barred plumage, which in
    gallinaceous birds is commonly the attribute of the hen, has been
    transferred to the cock, as in the cuckoo sub-breeds. In other
    cases masculine characters have been partly transferred to the
    female, as with the splendid plumage of the golden-spangled
    Hamburgh hen, the enlarged comb of the Spanish hen, the pugnacious
    disposition of the Game hen, and as in the well-developed spurs
    which occasionally appear in the hens of various breeds. In Polish
    fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot, that of the male
    being formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is a new male
    character in the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge,
    new characters are more apt to appear in the males of our
    domesticated animals than in the females,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> and afterwards to be inherited
    exclusively or more strongly by the males. Finally, in accordance
    with the principle of inheritance as limited by sex, the
    preservation and augmentation of secondary sexual characters in
    natural species offers no especial difficulty, as this would follow
    through that form of selection which I have called sexual
    selection.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Inheritance at corresponding periods of Life.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This is an important subject. Since the
    publication of my 'Origin of Species' I have seen no reason to
    doubt the truth of the explanation there given of one of the most
    remarkable facts in biology, namely, the difference between the
    embryo and the adult animal. The explanation is, that variations do
    not necessarily or generally occur at a very early period of
    embryonic growth, and that such variations are inherited at a
    corresponding age. As a consequence of this the embryo, even after
    the parent-form has undergone great modification, is left only
    slightly modified; and the embryos of widely-different animals
    which are descended from a common progenitor remain in many
    important respects like one another and probably like their common
    progenitor. We can thus understand why embryology throws a flood of
    light on the natural system of classification, as this ought to be
    as far as possible genealogical. When the embryo leads an
    independent life, that is, becomes a larva, it has to be adapted to
    the surrounding conditions in its structure and instincts,
    independently of those of its parents; and the principle of
    inheritance at corresponding periods of life renders this
    possible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This principle is, indeed, in one way so obvious
    that it escapes attention. We possess a number of races of animals
    and plants, which, when compared with one another and with their
    parent-forms, present conspicuous differences, both in their
    immature and mature states. Look at the seeds of the several kinds
    of peas, beans, maize, which can be propagated truly, and see how
    they differ in size, colour, and shape, whilst the full-grown
    plants differ but little. Cabbages, on the other hand, differ
    greatly in foliage and manner of growth, but hardly at all in their
    seeds; and generally it will be found that the differences between
    cultivated plants at different periods of growth are not
    necessarily closely connected together, for plants may differ much
    in their seeds and little when full-grown, and conversely may yield
    seeds hardly distinguishable, yet differ much when full-grown. In
    the several breeds of poultry, descended from a single species,
    differences in the eggs and chickens whilst covered with down, in
    the plumage at the first and subsequent moults, as well as in the
    comb and wattles, are all inherited. With man peculiarities in the
    milk and second teeth (of which I have received the details) are
    inheritable, and longevity is often transmitted. So again with our
    improved breeds of cattle and sheep, early maturity, including the
    early development of the teeth, and with certain breeds of fowl the
    early appearance of secondary sexual characters, all come under the
    same head of inheritance at corresponding periods.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Numerous analogous facts could be given. The
    silk-moth, perhaps, offers the best instance; for in the breeds
    which transmit their characters truly, the eggs differ in size,
    colour, and shape: the caterpillars differ, in moulting three or
    four times, in colour, even in having a dark-coloured mark like an
    eyebrow, and in the loss of certain instincts;&#8212;the cocoons
    differ in size, shape, and in the colour and quality of the silk;
    these several differences being followed by slight or barely
    distinguishable differences in the mature moth.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">But it may be said that, if in the above cases a
    new peculiarity is inherited, it must be at the corresponding stage
    of development; for an egg or seed can resemble only an egg or
    seed, and the horn in a full-grown ox can resemble only a horn. The
    following cases show inheritance at corresponding periods more
    plainly, because they refer to peculiarities which might have
    supervened, as far as we can see, earlier or later in life, yet are
    inherited at the same period at which they first appeared.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the Lambert family the porcupine-like
    excrescences appeared in the father and sons at the same age,
    namely, about nine weeks after birth.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> In the extraordinary hairy family
    described by Mr. Crawfurd,<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
    children were produced during three generations with hairy ears; in
    the father the hair began to grow over his body at six years old;
    in his daughter somewhat earlier, namely, at one year; and in both
    generations the milk teeth appeared late in life, the permanent
    teeth being afterwards singularly deficient. Greyness of hair at an
    unusually early age has been transmitted in some families. These
    cases border on diseases inherited at corresponding periods of
    life, to which I shall immediately refer.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is a well-known peculiarity with
    almond-tumbler pigeons, that the full beauty and peculiar character
    of the plumage does not appear until the bird has moulted two or
    three times. Neumeister describes and figures a brace of pigeons in
    which the whole body is white except the breast, neck, and head;
    but in their first plumage all the white feathers have coloured
    edges. Another breed is more remarkable: its first plumage is
    black, with rusty-red wing-bars and a crescent-shaped mark on the
    breast; these marks then become white, and remain so during three
    or four moults; but after this period the white spreads over the
    body, and the bird loses its beauty.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> Prize canary-birds have their wings and
    tail black: "this colour, however, is only retained until the first
    moult, so that they must be exhibited ere the change takes place.
    Once moulted, the peculiarity has ceased. Of course all the birds
    emanating from this stock have black wings and tails the first
    year."<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> A curious and somewhat
    analogous account has been given<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
    of a family of wild pied rooks which were first observed in 1798,
    near Chalfont, and which every year from that date up to the period
    of the published notice, viz., 1837 "have several of their brood
    particoloured, black and white. This variegation of the plumage,
    however, disappears with the first moult; but among the next young
    families there are always a few pied ones." These changes of
    plumage, which are inherited at various corresponding periods of
    life in the pigeon, canary-bird, and rook, are remarkable, because
    the parent-species passes through no such change.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Inherited diseases afford evidence in
    some respects of less value than the foregoing cases, because
    diseases are not necessarily connected with any change in
    structure; but in other respects of more value, because the periods
    have been more carefully observed. Certain diseases are
    communicated to the child apparently by a process like inoculation,
    and the child is from the first affected; such cases may be here
    passed over. Large classes of diseases usually appear at certain
    ages, such as St. Vitus's dance in youth, consumption in early
    mid-life, gout later, and apoplexy still later; and these are
    naturally inherited at the same period. But even in diseases of
    this class, instances have been recorded, as with St. Vitus's
    dance, showing that an unusually early or late tendency to the
    disease is inheritable.<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> In most
    cases the appearance of any inherited disease is largely determined
    by certain critical periods in each person's life, as well as by
    unfavourable conditions. There are many other diseases, which are
    not attached to any particular period, but which certainly tend to
    appear in the child at about the same age at which the parent was
    first attacked. An array of high authorities, ancient and modern,
    could be given in support of this proposition. The illustrious
    Hunter believed in it; and Piorry<A href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
    cautions the physician to look closely to the child at the period
    when any grave inheritable disease attacked the parent. Dr. Prosper
    Lucas,<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> after collecting facts
    from every source, asserts that affections of all kinds, though not
    related to any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the
    offspring at whatever period of life they first appeared in the
    progenitor.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As the subject is important, it may be
    well to give a few instances, simply as illustrations, not as
    proof; for proof, recourse must be had to the authorities above
    quoted. Some of the following cases have been selected for the sake
    of showing that, when a slight departure from the rule occurs, the
    child is affected somewhat earlier in life than the parent. In the
    family of Le Compte blindness was inherited through three
    generations, and no less than twenty-seven children and
    grandchildren were all affected at about the same age; their
    blindness in general began to advance about the fifteenth or
    sixteenth year, and ended in total deprivation of sight at the age
    of about twenty-two.<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> In another
    case a father and his four children all became blind at twenty-one
    years old; in another, a grandmother grew blind at thirty-five, her
    daughter at nineteen, and three grandchildren at the ages of
    thirteen and eleven.<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> So with
    deafness, two brothers, their father and paternal grandfather, all
    became deaf at the age of forty.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Esquirol gives several striking instances
    of insanity coming on at the same age, as that of a grandfather,
    father, and son, who all committed suicide near their fiftieth
    year. Many other cases could be given, as of a whole family who
    became insane at the age of forty.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Other cerebral affections sometimes
    follow the same rule,&#8212;for instance, epilepsy and apoplexy. A
    woman died of the latter disease when sixty-three years old; one of
    her daughters at forty-three, and the other at sixty-seven: the
    latter had twelve children, who all died from tubercular
    meningitis.<A href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> I mention this latter
    case because it illustrates a frequent occurrence, namely, a change
    in the precise nature of an inherited disease, though still
    affecting the same organ.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Asthma has attacked several members of
    the same family when forty years old, and other families during
    infancy. The most different diseases, such as angina pectoris,
    stone in the bladder, and various affections of the skin, have
    appeared in successive generations at nearly the same age. The
    little finger of a man began from some unknown cause to grow
    inwards, and the same finger in his two sons began at the same age
    to bend inwards in a similar manner. Strange and inexplicable
    neuralgic affections have caused parents and children to suffer
    agonies at about the same period of life.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will give only two other cases, which
    are interesting as illustrating the disappearance as well as the
    appearance of disease at the same age. Two brothers, their father,
    their paternal uncles, seven cousins, and their paternal
    grandfather, were all similarly affected by a skin-disease, called
    pityriasis versicolor; "the disease, strictly limited to the males
    of the family (though transmitted through the females), usually
    appeared at puberty, and disappeared at about the age of forty or
    forty-five years." The second case is that of four brothers, who
    when about twelve years old suffered almost every week from severe
    headaches, which were relieved only by a recumbent position in a
    dark room. Their father, paternal uncles, paternal grandfather, and
    granduncles all suffered in the same way from headaches, which
    ceased at the age of fifty-four or fifty-five in all those who
    lived so long. None of the females of the family were affected.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to read the foregoing accounts,
    and the many others which have been recorded, of diseases coming on
    during three or even more generations in several members of the
    same family at the same age, especially in the case of rare
    affections in which the coincidence cannot be attributed to chance,
    and to doubt that there is a strong tendency to inheritance in
    disease at corresponding periods of life. When the rule fails, the
    disease is apt to come on earlier in the child than in the parent;
    the exceptions in the other direction being very much rarer. Dr.
    Lucas<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> alludes to several cases of
    inherited diseases coming on at an earlier period. I have already
    given one striking instance with blindness during three
    generations; and Mr. Bowman remarks that this frequently occurs
    with cataract. With cancer there seems to be a peculiar liability
    to earlier inheritance: Sir J. Paget, who has particularly attended
    to this subject, and tabulated a large number of cases, informs me
    that he believes that in nine cases out of ten the later generation
    suffers from the disease at an earlier period than the previous
    generation. He adds, "In the instances in which the opposite
    relation holds, and the members of later generations have cancer at
    a later age than their predecessors, I think it will be found that
    the non-cancerous parents have lived to extreme old ages." So that
    the longevity of a non-affected parent seems to have the power of
    influencing the fatal period in the offspring; and we thus
    apparently get another element of complexity in inheritance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The facts, showing that with certain diseases
    the period of inheritance occasionally or even frequently advances,
    are important with respect to the general descent-theory, for they
    render it probable that the same thing would occur with ordinary
    modifications of structure. The final result of a long series of
    such advances would be the gradual obliteration of characters
    proper to the embryo and larva, which would thus come to resemble
    more and more closely the mature parent-form. But any structure
    which was of service to the embryo or larva would be preserved by
    the destruction at this stage of growth of each individual which
    manifested any tendency to lose its proper character at too early
    an age.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, from the numerous races of cultivated
    plants and domestic animals, in which the seeds or eggs, the young
    or old, differ from one another and from those of the
    parent-species;&#8212;from the cases in which new characters have
    appeared at a particular period, and afterwards been inherited at
    the same period;&#8212;and from what we know with respect to
    disease, we must believe in the truth of the great principle of
    inheritance at corresponding periods of life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Summary of the three preceding
    Chapters.</I>&#8212;Strong as is the force of inheritance, it
    allows the incessant appearance of new characters. These, whether
    beneficial or injurious,&#8212;of the most trifling importance,
    such as a shade of colour in a flower, a coloured lock of hair, or
    a mere gesture,&#8212;or of the highest importance, as when
    affecting the brain, or an organ so perfect and complex as the
    eye,&#8212;or of so grave a nature as to deserve to be called a
    monstrosity,&#8212;or so peculiar as not to occur normally in any
    member of the same natural class,&#8212;often inherited by man, by
    the lower animals, and plants. In numberless cases it suffices for
    the inheritance of a peculiarity that one parent alone should be
    thus characterised. Inequalities in the two sides of the body,
    though opposed to the law of symmetry, may be transmitted. There is
    ample evidence that the effects of mutilations and of accidents,
    especially or perhaps exclusively when followed by disease, are
    occasionally inherited. There can be no doubt that the evil effects
    of the long-continued exposure of the parent to injurious
    conditions are sometimes transmitted to the offspring. So it is, as
    we shall see in a future chapter, with the effects of the use and
    disuse of parts, and of mental habits. Periodical habits are
    likewise transmitted, but generally, as it would appear, with
    little force.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Hence we are led to look at inheritance as the
    rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly. But this power often
    appears to us in our ignorance to act capriciously, transmitting a
    character with inexplicable strength or feebleness. The very same
    peculiarity, as the weeping habit of trees, silky feathers, etc.,
    may be inherited either firmly or not at all by different members
    of the same group, and even by different individuals of the same
    species, though treated in the same manner. In this latter case we
    see that the power of transmission is a quality which is merely
    individual in its attachment. As with single characters, so it is
    with the several concurrent slight differences which distinguish
    sub-varieties or races; for of these, some can be propagated almost
    as truly as species, whilst others cannot be relied on. The same
    rule holds good with plants, when propagated by bulbs, offsets,
    etc., which in one sense still form parts of the same individual,
    for some varieties retain or inherit through successive
    bud-generations their character far more truly than others.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some characters not proper to the parent-species
    have certainly been inherited from an extremely remote epoch, and
    may therefore be considered as firmly fixed. But it is doubtful
    whether length of inheritance in itself gives fixedness of
    character; though the chances are obviously in favour of any
    character which has long been transmitted true or unaltered still
    being transmitted true as long as the conditions of life remain the
    same. We know that many species, after having retained the same
    character for countless ages, whilst living under their natural
    conditions, when domesticated have varied in the most diversified
    manner, that is, have failed to transmit their original form; so
    that no character appears to be absolutely fixed. We can sometimes
    account for the failure of inheritance by the conditions of life
    being opposed to the development of certain characters; and still
    oftener, as with plants cultivated by grafts and buds, by the
    conditions causing new and slight modifications incessantly to
    appear. In this latter case it is not that inheritance wholly
    fails, but that new characters are continually superadded. In some
    few cases, in which both parents are similarly characterised,
    inheritance seems to gain so much force by the combined action of
    the two parents, that it counteracts its own power, and a new
    modification is the result.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In many cases the failure of the parents to
    transmit their likeness is due to the breed having been at some
    former period crossed; and the child takes after his grandparent or
    more remote ancestor of foreign blood. In other cases, in which the
    breed has not been crossed, but some ancient character has been
    lost through variation, it occasionally reappears through
    reversion, so that the parents apparently fail to transmit their
    own likeness. In all cases, however, we may safely conclude that
    the child inherits all its characters from its parents, in whom
    certain characters are latent, like the secondary sexual characters
    of one sex in the other. When, after a long succession of
    bud-generations, a flower or fruit becomes separated into distinct
    segments, having the colours or other attributes of both
    parent-forms, we cannot doubt that these characters were latent in
    the earlier buds, though they could not then be detected, or could
    be detected only in an intimately commingled state. So it is with
    animals of crossed parentage, which with advancing years
    occasionally exhibit characters derived from one of their two
    parents, of which not a trace could at first be perceived. Certain
    monstrosities, which resemble what naturalists call the typical
    form of the group in question, apparently come under the same law
    of reversion. It is assuredly an astonishing fact that the male and
    female sexual elements, that buds, and even full-grown animals,
    should retain characters, during several generations in the case of
    crossed breeds, and during thousands of generations in the case of
    pure breeds, written as it were in invisible ink, yet ready at any
    time to be evolved under certain conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">What these conditions precisely are, we do not
    know. But any cause which disturbs the organisation or constitution
    seems to be sufficient. A cross certainly gives a strong tendency
    to the reappearance of long-lost characters, both corporeal and
    mental. In the case of plants, this tendency is much stronger with
    those species which have been crossed after long cultivation and
    which therefore have had their constitutions disturbed by this
    cause as well as by crossing, than with species which have always
    lived under their natural conditions and have then been crossed. A
    return, also, of domesticated animals and cultivated plants to a
    wild state favours reversion; but the tendency under these
    circumstances has been much exaggerated.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When individuals of the same family which differ
    somewhat, and when races or species are crossed, the one is often
    prepotent over the other in transmitting its character. A race may
    possess a strong power of inheritance, and yet when crossed, as we
    have seen with trumpeter-pigeons, yield to the prepotency of every
    other race. Prepotency of transmission may be equal in the two
    sexes of the same species, but often runs more strongly in one sex.
    It plays an important part in determining the rate at which one
    race can be modified or wholly absorbed by repeated crosses with
    another. We can seldom tell what makes one race or species
    prepotent over another; but it sometimes depends on the same
    character being present and visible in one parent, and latent or
    potentially present in the other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Characters may first appear in either sex, but
    oftener in the male than in the female, and afterwards be
    transmitted to the offspring of the same sex. In this case we may
    feel confident that the peculiarity in question is really present
    though latent in the opposite sex! hence the father may transmit
    through his daughter any character to his grandson; and the mother
    conversely to her granddaughter. We thus learn, and the fact is an
    important one, that transmission and development are distinct
    powers. Occasionally these two powers seem to be antagonistic, or
    incapable of combination in the same individual; for several cases
    have been recorded in which the son has not directly inherited a
    character from his father, or directly transmitted it to his son,
    but has received it by transmission through his non-affected
    mother, and transmitted it through his non-affected daughter. Owing
    to inheritance being limited by sex, we see how secondary sexual
    characters may have arisen under nature; their preservation and
    accumulation being dependent on their service to either sex.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">At whatever period of life a new character first
    appears, it generally remains latent in the offspring until a
    corresponding age is attained, and then is developed. When this
    rule fails, the child generally exhibits the character at an
    earlier period than the parent. On this principle of inheritance at
    corresponding periods, we can understand how it is that most
    animals display from the germ to maturity such a marvellous
    succession of characters.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Finally, though much remains obscure with
    respect to Inheritance, we may look at the following laws as fairly
    well established. Firstly, a tendency in every character, new and
    old, to be transmitted by seminal and bud generation, though often
    counteracted by various known and unknown causes. Secondly,
    reversion or atavism, which depends on transmission and development
    being distinct powers: it acts in various degrees and manners
    through both seminal and bud generation. Thirdly, prepotency of
    transmission, which may be confined to one sex, or be common to
    both sexes. Fourthly, transmission, as limited by sex, generally to
    the same sex in which the inherited character first appeared; and
    this in many, probably most cases, depends on the new character
    having first appeared at a rather late period of life. Fifthly,
    inheritance at corresponding periods of life, with some tendency to
    the earlier development of the inherited character. In these laws
    of Inheritance, as displayed under domestication, we see an ample
    provision for the production, through variability and natural
    selection, of new specific forms.</P>

      pp. 537-539, the fullest description which I have met with of

      likewise the conclusion of Flourens, and of Bechstein in his
      'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands,' b. i. s. 294. The tail of the
