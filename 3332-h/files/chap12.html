    <P align="JUSTIFY">The subject of inheritance is an immense one,
    and has been treated by many authors. One work alone, 'De
    l'H&#233;r&#233;dit&#233; Naturelle' by Dr. Prosper Lucas, runs to
    the length of 1562 pages. We must confine ourselves to certain
    points which have an important bearing on the general subject of
    variation, both with domestic and natural productions. It is
    obvious that a variation which is not inherited throws no light on
    the derivation of species, nor is of any service to man, except in
    the case of perennial plants, which can be propagated by buds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">If animals and plants had never been
    domesticated, and wild ones alone had been observed, we should
    probably never have heard the saying, that "like begets like." The
    proposition would have been as self-evident as that all the buds on
    the same tree are alike, though neither proposition is strictly
    true. For, as has often been remarked, probably no two individuals
    are identically the same. All wild animals recognise each other,
    which shows that there is some difference between them; and when
    the eye is well practised, the shepherd knows each sheep, and man
    can distinguish a fellow-man out of millions on millions of other
    men. Some authors have gone so far as to maintain that the
    production of slight differences is as much a necessary function of
    the powers of generation, as the production of offspring like their
    parents. This view, as we shall see in a future chapter, is not
    theoretically probable, though practically it holds good. The
    saying that "like begets like" has, in fact, arisen from the
    perfect confidence felt by breeders, that a superior or inferior
    animal will generally reproduce its kind; but this very superiority
    or inferiority shows that the individual in question has departed
    slightly from its type.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The whole subject of inheritance is wonderful.
    When a new character arises, whatever its nature may be, it
    generally tends to be inherited, at least in a temporary and
    sometimes in a most persistent manner. What can be more wonderful
    than that some trifling peculiarity, not primordially attached to
    the species, should be transmitted through the male or female
    sexual cells, which are so minute as not to be visible to the naked
    eye, and afterwards through the incessant changes of a long course
    of development, undergone either in the womb or in the egg, and
    ultimately appear in the offspring when mature, or even when quite
    old, as in the case of certain diseases? Or again, what can be more
    wonderful than the well-ascertained fact that the minute ovule of a
    good milking cow will produce a male, from whom a cell, in union
    with an ovule, will produce a female, and she, when mature, will
    have large mammary glands, yielding an abundant supply of milk, and
    even milk of a particular quality? Nevertheless, the real subject
    of surprise is, as Sir H. Holland has well remarked,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> not that a character should be inherited,
    but that any should ever fail to be inherited. In a future chapter,
    devoted to an hypothesis which I have termed pangenesis, an attempt
    will be made to show the means by which characters of all kinds are
    transmitted from generation to generation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some writers,<A href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
    who have not attended to natural history, have attempted to show
    that the force of inheritance has been much exaggerated. The
    breeders of animals would smile at such simplicity; and if they
    condescended to make any answer, might ask what would be the chance
    of winning a prize if two inferior animals were paired together?
    They might ask whether the half-wild Arabs were led by theoretical
    notions to keep pedigrees of their horses? Why have pedigrees been
    scrupulously kept and published of the Shorthorn cattle, and more
    recently of the Hereford breed? Is it an illusion that these
    recently improved animals safely transmit their excellent qualities
    even when crossed with other breeds? have the Shorthorns, without
    good reason, been purchased at immense prices and exported to
    almost every quarter of the globe, a thousand guineas having been
    given for a bull? With greyhounds pedigrees have likewise been
    kept, and the names of such dogs, as Snowball, Major, etc., are as
    well known to coursers as those of Eclipse and Herod on the turf.
    Even with the Gamecock, pedigrees of famous strains were formerly
    kept, and extended back for a century. With pigs, the Yorkshire and
    Cumberland breeders "preserve and print pedigrees;" and to show how
    such highly-bred animals are valued, I may mention that Mr. Brown,
    who won all the first prizes for small breeds at Birmingham in
    1850, sold a young sow and boar of his breed to Lord Ducie for 43
    guineas; the sow alone was afterwards sold to the Rev. F. Thursby
    for 65 guineas; who writes, "She paid me very well, having sold her
    produce for 300 pounds, and having now four breeding sows from
    her."<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> Hard cash paid down, over
    and over again, is an excellent test of inherited superiority. In
    fact, the whole art of breeding, from which such great results have
    been attained during the present century, depends on the
    inheritance of each small detail of structure. But inheritance is
    not certain; for if it were, the breeder's art<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> would be reduced to a certainty, and
    there would be little scope left for that wonderful skill and
    perseverance shown by the men who have left an enduring monument of
    their success in the present state of our domesticated animals.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is hardly possible, within a moderate
    compass, to impress on the mind of those who have not attended to
    the subject, the full conviction of the force of inheritance which
    is slowly acquired by rearing animals, by studying the many
    treatises which have been published on the various domestic
    animals, and by conversing with breeders. I will select a few facts
    of the kind, which, as far as I can judge, have most influenced my
    own mind. With man and the domestic animals, certain peculiarities
    have appeared in an individual, at rare intervals, or only once or
    twice in the history of the world, but have reappeared in several
    of the children and grandchildren. Thus Lambert, "the
    porcupine-man," whose skin was thickly covered with warty
    projections, which were periodically moulted, had all his six
    children and two grandsons similarly affected.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> The face and body being covered with long
    hair, accompanied by deficient teeth (to which I shall hereafter
    refer), occurred in three successive generations in a Siamese
    family; but this case is not unique, as a woman<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> with a completely hairy face who was
    exhibited in London in 1663, and another instance has recently
    occurred. Colonel Hallam<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> has
    described a race of two-legged pigs, "the hinder extremities being
    entirely wanting;" and this deficiency was transmitted through
    three generations. In fact, all races presenting any remarkable
    peculiarity, such as solid-hoofed swine, Mauchamp sheep, niata
    cattle, etc., are instances of the long-continued inheritance of
    rare deviations of structure.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When we reflect that certain extraordinary
    peculiarities have thus appeared in a single individual out of many
    millions, all exposed in the same country to the same general
    conditions of life, and, again, that the same extraordinary
    peculiarity has sometimes appeared in individuals living under
    widely different conditions of life, we are driven to conclude that
    such peculiarities are not directly due to the action of the
    surrounding conditions, but to unknown laws acting on the
    organisation or constitution of the individual;&#8212;that their
    production stands in hardly closer relation to the conditions of
    life than does life itself. If this be so, and the occurrence of
    the same unusual character in the child and parent cannot be
    attributed to both having been exposed to the same unusual
    conditions, then the following problem is worth consideration, as
    showing that the result cannot be due, as some authors have
    supposed, to mere coincidence, but must be consequent on the
    members of the same family inheriting something in common in their
    constitution. Let it be assumed that, in a large population, a
    particular affection occurs on an average in one out of a million,
    so that the <I>&#224; priori</I> chance that an individual taken at
    random will be so affected is only one in a million. Let the
    population consist of sixty millions, composed, we will assume, of
    ten million families, each containing six members. On these data,
    Professor Stokes has calculated for me that the odds will be no
    less than 8333 millions to 1 that in the ten million families there
    will not be even a single family in which one parent and two
    children will be affected by the peculiarity in question. But
    numerous instances could be given, in which several children have
    been affected by the same rare peculiarity with one of their
    parents; and in this case, more especially if the grandchildren be
    included in the calculation, the odds against mere coincidence
    become something prodigious, almost beyond enumeration.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In some respects the evidence of inheritance is
    more striking when we consider the reappearance of trifling
    peculiarities. Dr. Hodgkin formerly told me of an English family in
    which, for many generations, some members had a single lock
    differently coloured from the rest of the hair. I knew an Irish
    gentleman, who, on the right side of his head, had a small white
    lock in the midst of his dark hair: he assured me that his
    grandmother had a similar lock on the same side, and his mother on
    the opposite side. But it is superfluous to give instances; every
    shade of expression, which may often be seen alike in parents and
    children, tells the same story. On what a curious combination of
    corporeal structure, mental character, and training, handwriting
    depends! yet every one must have noted the occasional close
    similarity of the handwriting in father and son, although the
    father had not taught his son. A great collector of autographs
    assured me that in his collection there were several signatures of
    father and son hardly distinguishable except by their dates.
    Hofacker, in Germany, remarks on the inheritance of handwriting;
    and it has even been asserted that English boys when taught to
    write in France naturally cling to their English manner of writing;
    but for so extraordinary a statement more evidence is requisite.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Gait, gestures, voice, and general
    bearing are all inherited, as the illustrious Hunter and Sir A.
    Carlisle have insisted.<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> My father
    communicated to me some striking instances, in one of which a man
    died during the early infancy of his son, and my father, who did
    not see this son until grown up and out of health, declared that it
    seemed to him as if his old friend had risen from the grave, with
    all his highly peculiar habits and manners. Peculiar manners pass
    into tricks, and several instances could be given of their
    inheritance; as in the case, often quoted, of the father who
    generally slept on his back, with his right leg crossed over the
    left, and whose daughter, whilst an infant in the cradle, followed
    exactly the same habit, though an attempt was made to cure her.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> I will give one instance which has
    fallen under my own observation, and which is curious from being a
    trick associated with a peculiar state of mind, namely,
    pleasureable emotion. A boy had the singular habit, when pleased,
    of rapidly moving his fingers parallel to each other, and, when
    much excited, of raising both hands, with the fingers still moving,
    to the sides of his face on a level with the eyes; when this boy
    was almost an old man, he could still hardly resist this trick when
    much pleased, but from its absurdity concealed it. He had eight
    children. Of these, a girl, when pleased, at the age of four and a
    half years, moved her fingers in exactly the same way, and what is
    still odder, when much excited, she raised both her hands, with her
    fingers still moving, to the sides of her face, in exactly the same
    manner as her father had done, and sometimes even still continued
    to do so when alone. I never heard of any one, excepting this one
    man and his little daughter, who had this strange habit; and
    certainly imitation was in this instance out of the question.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some writers have doubted whether those complex
    mental attributes, on which genius and talent depend, are
    inherited, even when both parents are thus endowed. But he who will
    study Mr. Galton's able work on 'Hereditary Genius' will have its
    doubts allayed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately it matters not, as far as
    inheritance is concerned, how injurious a quality or structure may
    be if compatible with life. No one can read the many treatises<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> on hereditary disease and doubt
    this. The ancients were strongly of this opinion, or, as Ranchin
    expresses it, <I>Omnes Gr&#339;ci, Arabes, et Latini in eo
    consentiunt.</I> A long catalogue could be given of all sorts of
    inherited malformations and of predisposition to various diseases.
    With gout, fifty per cent of the cases observed in hospital
    practice are, according to Dr. Garrod, inherited, and a greater
    percentage in private practice. Every one knows how often insanity
    runs in families, and some of the cases given by Mr. Sedgwick are
    awful,&#8212;as of a surgeon, whose brother, father, and four
    paternal uncles were all insane, the latter dying by suicide; of a
    Jew, whose father, mother, and six brothers and sisters were all
    mad; and in some other cases several members of the same family,
    during three or four successive generations, have committed
    suicide. Striking instances have been recorded of epilepsy,
    consumption, asthma, stone in the bladder, cancer, profuse bleeding
    from the slightest injuries, of the mother not giving milk, and of
    bad parturition being inherited. In this latter respect I may
    mention an odd case given by a good observer,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> in which the fault lay in the offspring,
    and not in the mother: in a part of Yorkshire the farmers continued
    to select cattle with large hind-quarters, until they made a strain
    called "Dutch-buttocked," and "the monstrous size of the buttocks
    of the calf was frequently fatal to the cow, and numbers of cows
    were annually lost in calving."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Instead of giving numerous details on
    various inherited malformations and diseases, I will confine myself
    to one organ, that which is the most complex, delicate, and
    probably best-known in the human frame, namely, the eye, with its
    accessory parts.<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> To begin with
    the latter: I have received an account of a family in which one
    parent and the children are affected by drooping eyelids, in so
    peculiar a manner, that they cannot see without throwing their
    heads backwards. Mr. Wade, of Wakefield, has given me an analogous
    case of a man who had not his eyelids thus affected at birth, nor
    owed their state, as far as was known, to inheritance, but they
    began to droop whilst he was an infant after suffering from fits,
    and he has transmitted the affection to two out of his three
    children, as was evident in the photographs of the whole family
    sent to me together with this account. Sir A. Carlisle<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> specifies a pendulous fold to the
    eyelids, as inherited. "In a family," says Sir H. Holland,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> "where the father had a singular
    elongation of the upper eyelid, seven or eight children were born
    with the same deformity; two or three other children having it
    not." Many persons, as I hear from Sir J. Paget, have two or three
    hairs in their eyebrows much longer than the others; and even so
    trifling a peculiarity as this certainly runs in
    families.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the eye itself, the
    highest authority in England, Mr. Bowman, has been so kind as to
    give me the following remarks on certain inherited imperfections.
    First, hypermetropia, or morbidly long sight: in this affection,
    the organ, instead of being spherical, is too flat from front to
    back, and is often altogether too small, so that the retina is
    brought too forward for the focus of the humours; consequently a
    convex glass is required for clear vision of near objects, and
    frequently even of distant ones. This state occurs congenitally, or
    at a very early age, often in several children of the same family,
    where one of the parents has presented it.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> Secondly, myopia, or short-sight, in
    which the eye is egg-shaped and too long from front to back; the
    retina in this case lies behind the focus, and is therefore fitted
    to see distinctly only very near objects. This condition is not
    commonly congenital, but comes on in youth, the liability to it
    being well known to be transmissible from parent to child. The
    change from the spherical to the ovoidal shape seems the immediate
    consequence of something like inflammation of the coats, under
    which they yield, and there is ground for believing that it may
    often originate in causes acting on the individual affected,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> and may thenceforward become
    transmissible. When both parents are myopic Mr. Bowman has observed
    the hereditary tendency in this direction to be heightened, and
    some of the children to be myopic at an earlier age or in a higher
    degree than their parents. Thirdly, squinting is a familiar example
    of hereditary transmission: it is frequently a result of such
    optical defects as have been above mentioned; but the more primary
    and uncomplicated forms of it are also sometimes in a marked degree
    transmitted in a family. Fourthly, <I>Cataract,</I> or opacity of
    the crystalline lens, is commonly observed in persons whose parents
    have been similarly affected, and often at an earlier age in the
    children than in the parents. Occasionally more than one child in a
    family is thus afflicted, one of whose parents or other relations,
    presents the senile form of the complaint. When cataract affects
    several members of a family in the same generation, it is often
    seen to commence at about the same age in each: <I>e.g.,</I> in one
    family several infants or young persons may suffer from it; in
    another, several persons of middle age. Mr. Bowman also informs me
    that he has occasionally seen, in several members of the same
    family, various defects in either the right or left eye; and Mr.
    White Cooper has often seen peculiarities of vision confined to one
    eye reappearing in the same eye in the offspring.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The following cases are taken from an
    able paper by Mr. W. Sedgwick, and from Dr. Prosper Lucas.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> Amaurosis, either congenital or coming
    on late in life, and causing total blindness, is often inherited;
    it has been observed in three successive generations. Congenital
    absence of the iris has likewise been transmitted for three
    generations, a cleft-iris for four generations, being limited in
    this latter case to the males of the family. Opacity of the cornea
    and congenital smallness of the eyes have been inherited. Portal
    records a curious case, in which a father and two sons were
    rendered blind, whenever the head was bent downwards, apparently
    owing to the crystalline lens, with its capsule, slipping through
    an unusually large pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye.
    Day-blindness, or imperfect vision under a bright light, is
    inherited, as is night-blindness, or an incapacity to see except
    under a strong light: a case has been recorded, by M. Cunier, of
    this latter defect having affected eighty-five members of the same
    family during six generations. The singular incapacity of
    distinguishing colours, which has been called <I>Daltonism,</I> is
    notoriously hereditary, and has been traced through five
    generations, in which it was confined to the female
    sex.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to the colour of the iris:
    deficiency of colouring matter is well known to be hereditary in
    albinoes. The iris of one eye being of different colour from that
    of the other, and the iris being spotted, are cases which have been
    inherited. Mr. Sedgwick gives, in addition, on the authority of Dr.
    Osborne,<A href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> the following curious
    instance of strong inheritance: a family of sixteen sons and five
    daughters all had eyes "resembling in miniature the markings on the
    back of a tortoiseshell cat." The mother of this large family had
    three sisters and a brother all similarly marked, and they derived
    this peculiarity from their mother, who belonged to a family
    notorious for transmitting it to their posterity.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Finally, Dr. Lucas emphatically remarks
    that there is not one single faculty of the eye which is not
    subject to anomalies; and not one which is not subjected to the
    principle of inheritance. Mr. Bowman agrees with the general truth
    of this proposition; which of course does not imply that all
    malformations are necessarily inherited; this would not even follow
    if both parents were affected by an anomaly which in most cases was
    transmissible.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Even if no single fact had been known with
    respect to the inheritance of disease and malformations by man, the
    evidence would have been ample in the case of the horse. And this
    might have been expected, as horses breed much quicker than man,
    are matched with care, and are highly valued. I have consulted many
    works, and the unanimity of the belief by veterinaries of all
    nations in the transmission of various morbid tendencies is
    surprising. Authors who have had wide experience give in detail
    many singular cases, and assert that contracted feet, with the
    numerous contingent evils, of ring-bones, curbs, splints, spavin,
    founder and weakness of the front legs, roaring or broken and thick
    wind, melanosis, specific ophthalmia, and blindness (the great
    French veterinary Huzard going so far as to say that a blind race
    could soon be formed), crib-biting, jibbing and ill-temper, are all
    plainly hereditary. Youatt sums up by saying "there is scarcely a
    malady to which the horse is subject which is not hereditary;" and
    M. Bernard adds that the doctrine "that there is scarcely a disease
    which does not run in the stock, is gaining new advocates every
    day."<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> So it is in regard to
    cattle, with consumption, good and bad teeth, fine skin, etc. etc.
    But enough, and more than enough, has been said on disease. Andrew
    Knight, from his own experience, asserts that disease is hereditary
    with plants; and this assertion is endorsed by Lindley.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Seeing how hereditary evil qualities are, it is
    fortunate that good health, vigour, and longevity are equally
    inherited. It was formerly a well-known practice, when annuities
    were purchased to be received during the life-time of a nominee, to
    search out a person belonging to a family of which many members had
    lived to extreme old age. As to the inheritance of vigour and
    endurance, the English race-horse offers an excellent instance.
    Eclipse begot 334, and King Herod 497 winners. A "cock-tail" is a
    horse not purely bred, but with only one-eighth, or one-sixteenth
    impure blood in his veins, yet very few instances have ever
    occurred of such horses having won a great race. They are sometimes
    as fleet for short distances as thoroughbreds, but as Mr. Robson,
    the great trainer, asserts, they are deficient in wind, and cannot
    keep up the pace. Mr. Lawrence also remarks, "perhaps no instance
    has ever occurred of a three-part-bred horse saving his <I>
    'distance'</I> in running two miles with thoroughbred racers." It
    has been stated by Cecil, that when unknown horses, whose parents
    were not celebrated, have unexpectedly won great races, as in the
    case of Priam, they can always be proved to be descended, on both
    sides, through many generations, from first-rate ancestors. On the
    Continent, Baron Cameronn challenges, in a German veterinary
    periodical, the opponents of the English race-horse to name one
    good horse on the Continent, which has not some English race-blood
    in his veins.<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the transmission of the many
    slight, but infinitely diversified characters, by which the
    domestic races of animals and plants are distinguished, nothing
    need be said; for the very existence of persistent races proclaims
    the power of inheritance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A few special cases, however, deserve some
    consideration. It might have been anticipated, that deviations from
    the law of symmetry would not have been inherited. But Anderson<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> states that a rabbit produced in a
    litter a young animal having only one ear; and from this animal a
    breed was formed which steadily produced one-eared rabbits. He also
    mentions a bitch with a single leg deficient, and she produced
    several puppies with the same deficiency. From Hofacker's
    account,<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> it appears that a
    one-horned stag was seen in 1781 in a forest in Germany, in 1788
    two, and afterwards, from year to year, many were observed with
    only one horn on the right side of the head. A cow lost a horn by
    suppuration,<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> and she produced
    three calves which had on the same side of the head, instead of a
    horn, a small bony lump attached merely to the skin; but we here
    encroach on the subject of inherited mutilations. A man who is
    left-handed, and a shell in which the spire turns in the wrong
    directions, are departures from the normal asymmetrical condition,
    and they are well-known to be inherited.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Polydactylism.</I>&#8212;Supernumerary
    fingers and toes are eminently liable, as various authors have
    insisted, to be inherited. Polydactylism graduates<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> by multifarious steps from a mere
    cutaneous appendage, not including any bone, to a double hand. But
    an additional digit, supported on a metacarpal bone, and furnished
    with all the proper muscles, nerves, and vessels, is sometimes so
    perfect, that it escapes detection, unless the fingers are actually
    counted. Occasionally there are several supernumerary digits; but
    usually only one, making the total number six. This one may be
    attached to the inner or outer margin of the hand, representing
    either a thumb or little finger, the latter being the more
    frequent. Generally, through the law of correlation, both hands and
    both feet are similarly affected. Dr. Burt Wilder has tabulated<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> a large number of cases, and finds
    that supernumerary digits are more common on the hands than on the
    feet, and that men are affected oftener than women. Both these
    facts can be explained on two principles which seem generally to
    hold good; firstly, that of two parts, the more specialised one is
    the more variable, and the arm is more highly specialised than the
    leg; and secondly that male animals are more variable than
    females.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The presence of a greater number of
    digits than five is a great anomaly, for this number is not
    normally exceeded by any existing mammal, bird, or reptile.
    Nevertheless, supernumerary digits are strongly inherited; they
    have been transmitted through five generations; and in some cases,
    after disappearing for one, two, or even three generations, have
    reappeared through reversion. These facts are rendered, as
    Professor Huxley has observed, more remarkable from its being known
    in most cases that the affected person has not married one
    similarly affected. In such cases the child of the fifth generation
    would have only 1-32nd part of the blood of his first sedigitated
    ancestor. Other cases are rendered remarkable by the affection
    gathering force, as Dr. Struthers has shown, in each generation,
    though in each the affected person married one not affected;
    moreover, such additional digits are often amputated soon after
    birth, and can seldom have been strengthened by use. Dr. Struthers
    gives the following instance: in the first generation an additional
    digit appeared on one hand; in the second, on both hands; in the
    third, three brothers had both hands, and one of the brothers a
    foot affected; and in the fourth generation all four limbs were
    affected. Yet we must not over-estimate the force of inheritance.
    Dr. Struthers asserts that cases of non-inheritance and of the
    first appearance of additional digits in unaffected families are
    much more frequent than cases of inheritance. Many other deviations
    of structure, of a nature almost as anomalous as supernumerary
    digits, such as deficient phalanges,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> thickened joints, crooked fingers, etc.,
    are, in like manner, strongly inherited, and are equally subject to
    intermission, together with reversion, though in such cases there
    is no reason to suppose that both parents had been similarly
    affected.<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Additional digits have been observed in
    negroes as well as in other races of man, and in several of the
    lower animals, and have been inherited. Six toes have been
    described on the hind feet of the newt (<I>Salamandra
    cristata</I>), and are said to have occurred with the frog. It
    deserves notice, that the six-toed newt, though adult, preserved
    some of its larval characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus,
    which is properly absorbed during the act of metamorphosis, was
    retained. It is also remarkable that in the case of man various
    structures in an embryonic or arrested state of development, such
    as a cleft-palate, bifid uterus, etc., are often accompanied by
    polydactylism.<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> Six toes on the
    hinder feet are known to have been inherited for three generations
    of cats. In several breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is double,
    and is generally transmitted truly, as is well shown when Dorkings
    are crossed with common four-toed breeds.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> With animals which have properly less
    than five digits, the number is sometimes increased to five,
    especially on the front legs, though rarely carried beyond that
    number; but this is due to the development of a digit already
    existing in a more or less rudimentary state. Thus, the dog has
    properly four toes behind, but in the larger breeds a fifth toe is
    commonly, though not perfectly, developed. Horses, which properly
    have one toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the others,
    have been described with each foot bearing two or three small
    separate hoofs: analogous facts have been noticed with cows, sheep,
    goats, and pigs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>There is a famous case described by Mr.
    White of a child, three years old, with a thumb double from the
    first joint. He removed the lesser thumb, which was furnished with
    a nail; but to his astonishment it grew again and reproduced a
    nail. The child was then taken to an eminent London surgeon, and
    the newly-grown thumb was removed by its socket-joint, but again it
    grew and reproduced a nail. Dr. Struthers mentions a case of the
    partial regrowth of an additional thumb, amputated when a child was
    three months old; and the late Dr. Falconer communicated to me an
    analogous instance. In the last edition of this work I also gave a
    case of the regrowth of a supernumerary little-finger after
    amputation; but having been informed by Dr. Bachmaier that several
    eminent surgeons expressed, at a meeting of the Anthropological
    Society of Munich, great doubt about my statements, I have made
    more particular inquiries. The full information thus gained,
    together with a tracing of the hand in its present state, has been
    laid before Sir J. Paget, and he has come to the conclusion that
    the degree of regrowth in this case is not greater than sometimes
    occurs with normal bones, especially with the humerus, when
    amputated at an early age. He further does not feel fully satisfied
    about the facts recorded by Mr. White. This being so, it is
    necessary for me to withdraw the view which I formerly advanced,
    with much hesitation, chiefly on the ground of the supposed
    regrowth of additional digits, namely, that their occasional
    development in man is a case of reversion to a lowly, organised
    progenitor provided with more than five digits.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I may here allude to a class of facts closely
    allied to, but somewhat different from, ordinary cases of
    inheritance. Sir H. Holland<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
    states that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently
    affected, often at about the same age, by the same peculiar
    disease, not known to have previously occurred in the family. He
    specifies the occurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten
    years old; he also remarks that children of the same family often
    exhibit in common infantile diseases, the same peculiar symptoms.
    My father mentioned to me the case of four brothers who died
    between the ages of sixty and seventy, in the same highly peculiar
    comatose state. An instance has already been given of supernumerary
    digits appearing in four children out of six in a previously
    unaffected family. Dr. Devay states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> that two brothers married two sisters,
    their first-cousins, none of the four nor any relation being an
    albino; but the seven children produced from this double marriage
    were all perfect albinoes. Some of these cases, as Mr. Sedgwick<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> has shown, are probably the result
    of reversion to a remote ancestor, of whom no record had been
    preserved; and all these cases are so far directly connected with
    inheritance that no doubt the children inherited a similar
    constitution from their parents, and, from being exposed to nearly
    similar conditions of life, it is not surprising that they should
    be affected in the same manner and at the same period of life.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Most of the facts hitherto given have served to
    illustrate the force of inheritance, but we must now consider cases
    grouped as well as the subject allows into classes, showing how
    feeble, capricious, or deficient the power of inheritance sometimes
    is. When a new peculiarity first appears, we can never predict
    whether it will be inherited. If both parents from their birth
    present the same peculiarity, the probability is strong that it
    will be transmitted to at least some of their offspring. We have
    seen that variegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed,
    taken from a branch which had become variegated through
    bud-variation, than from plants which were variegated as seedlings.
    With most plants the power of transmission notoriously depends on
    some innate capacity in the individual: thus Vilmorin<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> raised from a peculiarly coloured balsam
    some seedlings, which all resembled their parent; but of these
    seedlings some failed to transmit the new character, whilst others
    transmitted it to all their descendants during several successive
    generations. So again with a variety of the rose, two plants alone
    out of six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of transmitting the
    desired character; numerous analogous cases could be given.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The weeping or pendulous growth of trees
    is strongly inherited in some cases, and, without any assignable
    reason, feebly in other cases. I have selected this character as an
    instance of capricious inheritance, because it is certainly not
    proper to the parent-species, and because, both sexes being borne
    on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same character. Even
    supposing that there may have been in some instances crossing with
    adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable that all
    the seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court there
    is a famous weeping oak; many of its branches "are 30 feet long,
    and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:" this
    tree transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree,
    to all its seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that
    they have to be supported by props; others not showing the weeping
    tendency till about twenty years old.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> Mr. Rivers fertilised, as he informs me,
    the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn (<I>Crat&#230;gus
    oxyacantha</I>) with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and
    three young trees, "now six or seven years old, show a decided
    tendency to be pendulous, but as yet are not so much so as the
    mother-plant." According to Mr. MacNab,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> seedlings from a magnificent weeping
    birch (<I>Betula alba</I>), in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh,
    grew for the first ten or fifteen years upright, but then all
    became weepers like their parent. A peach with pendulous branches,
    like those of the weeping willow, has been found capable of
    propagation by seed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> Lastly, a
    weeping or rather a prostrate yew (<I>Taxus baccata</I>) was found
    in a hedge in Shropshire; it was a male, but one branch bore female
    flowers, and produced berries; these, being sown, produced
    seventeen trees all of which had exactly the same peculiar habit
    with the parent-tree.<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>These facts, it might have been thought,
    would have been sufficient to render it probable that a pendulous
    habit would in all cases be strictly inherited. But let us look to
    the other side. Mr. MacNab<A href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> sowed
    seeds of the weeping beech (<I>Fagus sylvatica</I>), but succeeded
    in raising only common beeches. Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised a
    number of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm;
    and at least one of the parent-trees was so situated that it could
    not have been crossed by any other elm; but none of the young
    trees, now about a foot or two in height, show the least signs of
    weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly sowed above twenty thousand seeds of
    the weeping ash (<I>Fraxinus excelsior</I>), and not a single
    seedling was in the least degree pendulous: in Germany, M.
    Borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings, with the same result.
    Nevertheless, Mr. Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic Garden, by
    sowing seed from a weeping ash, which was found before the year
    1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised several pendulous trees.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> Professor Henslow also informs me that
    some seedlings from a female weeping ash in the Botanic Garden at
    Cambridge were at first a little pendulous, but afterwards became
    quite upright: it is probable that this latter tree, which
    transmits to a certain extent its pendulous habit, was derived by a
    bud from the same original Cambridgeshire stock; whilst other
    weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin. But the crowning
    case, communicated to me by Mr. Rivers, which shows how capricious
    is the inheritance of a pendulous habit, is that a variety of
    another species of ash (<I>F. lentiscifolia</I>), now about twenty
    years old, which was formerly pendulous, "has long lost this habit,
    every shoot being remarkably erect; but seedlings formerly raised
    from it were perfectly prostrate, the stems not rising more than
    two inches above the ground." Thus the weeping variety of the
    common ash, which has been extensively propagated by buds during a
    long period, did not with Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one
    seedling out of above twenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety
    of a second species of ash, which could not, whilst grown in the
    same garden, retain its own weeping character, transmitted to its
    character the pendulous habit in excess!</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Many analogous facts could be given,
    showing how apparently capricious is the principle of inheritance.
    All the seedlings from a variety of the Barberry (<I>B.
    vulgaris</I>) with red leaves inherited the same character; only
    about one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech (<I>Fagus
    sylvatica</I>) had purple leaves. Not one out of a hundred
    seedlings of a variety of the <I>Cerasus padus,</I> with yellow
    fruit, bore yellow fruit: one-twelfth of the seedlings of the
    variety of <I>Cornus mascula,</I> with yellow fruit, came true:<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> and lastly, all the trees raised by
    my father from a yellow-berried holly (<I>Ilex aquifolium</I>),
    found wild, produced yellow berries. Vilmorin<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> observed in a bed of <I>Saponaria
    calabrica</I> an extremely dwarf variety, and raised from it a
    large number of seedlings; some of these partially resembled their
    parent, and he selected their seed; but the grandchildren were not
    in the least dwarfed: on the other hand, he observed a stunted and
    bushy variety of <I>Tagetes signata</I> growing in the midst of the
    common varieties by which it was probably crossed; for most of the
    seedlings raised from this plant were intermediate in character,
    only two perfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved from
    these two plants reproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly
    any selection has since been necessary.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Flowers transmit their colour truly, or
    most capriciously. Many annuals come true: thus I purchased German
    seeds of thirty-four named sub-varieties of one <I>race</I> of
    ten-week stocks (<I>Matthiola annua</I>), and raised a hundred and
    forty plants, all of which, with the exception of a single plant,
    came true. In saying this, however, it must be understood that I
    could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the thirty-four named
    sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower always correspond
    with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that they came true,
    because in each of the thirty-six short rows every plant was
    absolutely alike, with the one single exception. Again, I procured
    packets of German seed of twenty-five named varieties of common and
    quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty-four plants; of
    these, all except ten were true in the above limited sense; and I
    considered even a wrong shade of colour as false.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> It is a singular circumstance that white
    varieties generally transmit their colour much more truly than any
    other variety. This fact probably stands in close relation with one
    observed by Verlot,<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> namely, that
    flowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other colour.
    I have found that the white varieties of <I>Delphinium
    consolida</I> and of the Stock are the truest. It is, indeed,
    sufficient to look through a nurseryman's seed-list, to see the
    large number of white varieties which can be propagated by seed.
    The several coloured varieties of the sweet-pea (<I>Lathyrus
    odoratus</I>) are very true; but I hear from Mr. Masters, of
    Canterbury, who has particularly attended to this plant, that the
    white variety is the truest. The hyacinth, when propagated by seed,
    is extremely inconstant in colour, but "white hyacinths almost
    always give by seed white-flowered plants;"<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> and Mr. Masters informs me that the
    yellow varieties also reproduce their colour, but of different
    shades. On the other hand, pink and blue varieties, the latter
    being the natural colour, are not nearly so true: hence, as Mr.
    Masters has remarked to me, "we see that a garden variety may
    acquire a more permanent habit than a natural species;" but it
    should have been added, that this occurs under cultivation, and
    therefore under changed conditions.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With many flowers, especially perennials,
    nothing can be more fluctuating than the colour of the seedlings,
    as is notoriously the case with verbenas, carnations, dahlias,
    cinerarias, and others.<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> I sowed
    seed of twelve named varieties of Snapdragon (<I>Antirrhinum
    majus</I>), and utter confusion was the result. In most cases the
    extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in
    chief part due to crosses between differently-coloured varieties
    during previous generations. It is almost certain that this is the
    case with the polyanthus and coloured primrose (<I>Primula
    veris</I> and <I>vulgaris</I>), from their reciprocally dimorphic
    structure;<A href="#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> and these are plants
    which florists speak of as never coming true by seed: but if care
    be taken to prevent crossing, neither species is by any means very
    inconstant, in colour; thus I raised twenty-three plants from a
    purple primrose, fertilised by Mr. J. Scott with its pollen, and
    eighteen came up purple of different shades, and only five reverted
    to the ordinary yellow colour: again, I raised twenty plants from a
    bright-red cowslip, similarly treated by Mr. Scott, and every one
    perfectly resembled its parent in colour, as likewise did, with the
    exception of a single plant, 72 grandchildren. Even with the most
    variable flowers, it is probable that each delicate shade of colour
    might be permanently fixed so as to be transmitted by seed, by
    cultivation in the same soil, by long-continued selection, and
    especially by the prevention of crosses. I infer this from certain
    annual larkspurs (<I>Delphinium consolida</I> and <I>ajacis</I>),
    of which common seedlings present a greater diversity of colour
    than any other plant known to me; yet on procuring seed of five
    named German varieties of <I>D. consolida,</I> only nine plants out
    of ninety-four were false; and the seedlings of six varieties of
    <I>D. ajacis</I> were true in the same manner and degree as with
    the stocks above described. A distinguished botanist maintains that
    the annual species of Delphinium are always self-fertilised;
    therefore I may mention that thirty-two flowers on a branch of <I>
    D. consolida,</I> enclosed in a net, yielded twenty-seven capsules,
    with an average of 17&#183;2 seed in each; whilst five flowers,
    under the same net, which were artificially fertilised, in the same
    manner as must be effected by bees during their incessant visits,
    yielded five capsules with an average of 35&#183;2 fine seed; and
    this shows that the agency of insects is necessary for the full
    fertility of this plant. Analogous facts could be given with
    respect to the crossing of many other flowers, such as carnations,
    etc., of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As with flowers, so with our domesticated
    animals, no character is more variable than colour, and probably in
    no animal more so than with the horse. Yet, with a little care in
    breeding, it appears that races of any colour might soon be formed.
    Hofacker gives the result of matching two hundred and sixteen mares
    of four different colours with like-coloured stallions, without
    regard to the colour of their ancestors; and of the two hundred and
    sixteen colts born, eleven alone failed to inherit the colour of
    their parents: Autenrieth and Ammon assert that, after two
    generations, colts of a uniform colour are produced with
    certainty.<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be
    inherited, apparently from the force of inheritance being too
    strong. I have been assured by breeders of the canary-bird that to
    get a good jonquil-coloured bird it does not answer to pair two
    jonquils, as the colour then comes out too strong, or is even
    brown; but this statement is disputed by other breeders. So again,
    if two crested canaries are paired, the young birds rarely inherit
    this character:<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> for in crested
    birds a narrow space of bare skin is left on the back of the head,
    where the feathers are up-turned to form the crest, and, when both
    parents are thus characterised, the bareness becomes excessive, and
    the crest itself fails to be developed. Mr. Hewitt, speaking of
    Laced Sebright Bantams, says<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A>
    that, "why this should be so I know not, but I am confident that
    those that are best laced frequently produce offspring very far
    from perfect in their markings, whilst those exhibited by myself,
    which have so often proved successful, were bred from the union of
    heavily-laced birds with those that were scarcely sufficiently
    laced."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is a singular fact that, although several
    deaf-mutes often occur in the same family, and though their cousins
    and other relations are often in the same condition, yet their
    parents are rarely deaf-mutes. To give a single instance: not one
    scholar out of 148, who were at the same time in the London
    Institution, was the child of parents similarly affected. So again,
    when a male or female deaf-mute marries a sound person, their
    children are most rarely affected: in Ireland, out of 203 children
    thus produced one alone was mute. Even when both parents have been
    deaf-mutes, as in the case of forty-one marriages in the United
    States and of six in Ireland, only two deaf and dumb children were
    produced. Mr. Sedgwick,<A href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> in
    commenting on this remarkable and fortunate failure in the power of
    transmission in the direct line, remarks that it may possibly be
    owing to "excess having reversed the action of some natural law in
    development." But it is safer in the present state of our knowledge
    to look at the whole case as simply unintelligible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although many congenital monstrosities are
    inherited, of which examples have already been given, and to which
    may be added the lately recorded case of the transmission during a
    century of hare-lip with a cleft-palate in the writer's own
    family,<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> yet other malformations
    are rarely or never inherited. Of these latter cases, many are
    probably due to injuries in the womb or egg, and would come under
    the head of non-inherited injuries or mutilations. With plants, a
    long catalogue of inherited monstrosities of the most serious and
    diversified nature could easily be given; and with plants, there is
    no reason to suppose that monstrosities are caused by direct
    injuries to the seed or embryo.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the inheritance of structures
    mutilated by injuries or altered by disease, it was until lately
    difficult to come to any definite conclusion. Some mutilations have
    been practised for a vast number of generations without any
    inherited result. Godron remarks<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
    that different races of man have from time immemorial knocked out
    their upper incisors, cut off joints of their fingers, made holes
    of immense size through the lobes of their ears or through their
    nostrils, tatooed themselves, made deep gashes in various parts of
    their bodies, and there is no reason to suppose that these
    mutilations have ever been inherited.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> Adhesions due to inflammation and pits
    from the small-pox (and formerly many consecutive generations must
    have been thus pitted) are not inherited. With respect to Jews, I
    have been assured by three medical men of the Jewish faith that
    circumcision, which has been practised for so many ages, has
    produced no inherited effect. Blumenbach, however, asserts<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> that Jews are often born in Germany in a
    condition rendering circumcision difficult, so that a name is given
    them signifying "born circumcised;" and Professor Preyer informs me
    that this is the case in Bonn, such children being considered the
    special favourites of Jehovah. I have also heard from Dr. A.
    Newman, of Guy's Hospital, of the grandson of a circumcised Jew,
    the father not having been circumcised, in a similar condition. But
    it is possible that all these cases may be accidental coincidence,
    for Sir J. Paget has seen five sons of a lady and one son of her
    sister with adherent prepuces; and one of these boys was affected
    in a manner "which might be considered like that commonly produced
    by circumcision;" yet there was no suspicion of Jewish blood in the
    family of these two sisters. Circumcision is practised by
    Mahomedans, but at a much later age than by Jews; and Dr. Riedel,
    Assistant Resident in North Celebes, writes to me that the boys
    there go naked until from six to ten years old; and he has observed
    that many of them, though not all, have their prepuces much reduced
    in length, and this he attributes to the inherited effects of the
    operation. In the vegetable kingdom oaks and other trees have borne
    galls from primeval times, yet they do not produce inherited
    excrescences; and many other such facts could be adduced.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the above several negative
    cases, we now possess conclusive evidence that the effects of
    operations are sometimes inherited. Dr. Brown-S&#233;quard<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> gives the following summary of his
    observations on guinea-pigs; and this summary is so important that
    I will quote the whole:&#8212;</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"1st. Appearance of epilepsy in animals
    born of parents having been rendered epileptic by an injury to the
    spinal cord.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"2nd. Appearance of epilepsy also in
    animals born of parents having been rendered epileptic by the
    section of the sciatic nerve.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"3rd. A change in the shape of the ear in
    animals born of parents in which such a change was the effect of a
    division of the cervical sympathetic nerve.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"4th. Partial closure of the eyelids in
    animals born of parents in which that state of the eyelids had been
    caused either by the section of the cervical sympathetic nerve or
    the removal of the superior cervical ganglion.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"5th. Exophthalmia in animals born of
    parents in which an injury to the restiform body had produced that
    protrusion of the eyeball. This interesting fact I have witnessed a
    good many times, and I have seen the transmission of the morbid
    state of the eye continue through four generations. In these
    animals, modified by heredity, the two eyes generally protruded,
    although in the parents usually only one showed exophthalmia, the
    lesion having been made in most cases only on one of the corpora
    restiformia.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"6th. H&#230;matoma and dry gangrene of
    the ears in animals born of parents in which these ear-alterations
    had been caused by an injury to the restiform body near the nib of
    the calamus.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"7th. Absence of two toes out of the
    three of the hind leg, and sometimes of the three, in animals whose
    parents had eaten up their hind-leg toes which had become
    an&#230;sthetic from a section of the sciatic nerve alone, or of
    that nerve and also of the crural. Sometimes, instead of complete
    absence of the toes, only a part of one or two or three was missing
    in the young, although in the parent not only the toes but the
    whole foot was absent (partly eaten off, partly destroyed by
    inflammation, ulceration, or gangrene).</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"8th. Appearance of various morbid states
    of the skin and hair of the neck and face in animals born of
    parents having had similar alterations in the same parts, as
    effects of an injury to the sciatic nerve."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It should be especially observed that
    Brown-S&#233;quard has bred during thirty years many thousand
    guinea-pigs from animals which had not been operated upon, and not
    one of these manifested the epileptic tendency. Nor has he ever
    seen a guinea-pig born without toes, which was not the offspring of
    parents which had gnawed off their own toes owing to the sciatic
    nerve having been divided. Of this latter fact thirteen instances
    were carefully recorded, and a greater number were seen; yet
    Brown-S&#233;quard speaks of such cases as one of the rarer forms
    of inheritance. It is a still more interesting fact&#8212;</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>"That the sciatic nerve in the
    congenitally toeless animal has inherited the power of passing
    through all the different morbid states which have occurred in one
    of its parents from the time of the division till after its reunion
    with the peripheric end. It is not therefore simply the power of
    performing an action which is inherited, but the power of
    performing a whole series of actions, in a certain
    order."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In most of the cases of inheritance recorded by
    Brown-S&#233;quard only one of the two parents had been operated
    upon and was affected. He concludes by expressing his belief that
    "what is transmitted is the morbid state of the nervous system,"
    due to the operation performed on the parents.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With the lower animals Dr. Prosper Lucas has
    collected a long list of inherited injuries. A few instances will
    suffice. A cow lost a horn from an accident with consequent
    suppuration, and she produced three calves which were hornless on
    the same side of the head. With the horse, there seems hardly a
    doubt that exostoses on the legs, caused by too much travelling on
    hard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records the case of a man who
    had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off, and which
    in consequence grew crooked, and his sons had the same finger on
    the same hand similarly crooked. A soldier, fifteen years before
    his marriage, lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia, and his
    two sons were microphthalmic on the same side.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> In all cases in which a parent has had
    an organ injured on one side, and two or more of the offspring are
    born with the same organ affected on the same side, the chances
    against mere coincidence are almost infinitely great. Even when
    only a single child is born having exactly the same part of the
    body affected as that of his injured parent, the chances against
    coincidence are great; and Professor Rolleston has given me two
    such cases which have fallen under his own
    observation,&#8212;namely of two men, one of whom had his knee and
    the other his cheek severely cut, and both had children born with
    exactly the same spot marked or scarred. Many instances have been
    recorded of cats, dogs, and horses, which have had their tails,
    legs, etc., amputated or injured, producing offspring with the same
    parts ill-formed; but as it is not very rare for similar
    malformations to appear spontaneously, all such cases may be due to
    coincidence. It is, however, an argument on the other side that
    "under the old excise laws the shepherd-dog was only exempt from
    tax when without a tail, and for this reason it was always
    removed;"<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> and there still exist
    breeds of the shepherd-dog which are always born destitute of a
    tail. Finally, it must be admitted, more especially since the
    publication of Brown-S&#233;quard's observations, that the effects
    of injuries, especially when followed by disease, or perhaps
    exclusively when thus followed, are occasionally inherited.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A></P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Causes of Non-inheritance.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A large number of cases of non-inheritance are
    intelligible on the principle, that a strong tendency to
    inheritance does exist, but that it is overborne by hostile or
    unfavourable conditions of life. No one would expect that our
    improved pigs, if forced during several generations to travel about
    and root in the ground for their own subsistence, would transmit,
    as truly as they now do their short muzzles and legs, and their
    tendency to fatten. Dray-horses assuredly would not long transmit
    their great size and massive limbs, if compelled to live on a cold,
    damp mountainous region; we have indeed evidence of such
    deterioration in the horses which have run wild on the Falkland
    Islands. European dogs in India often fail to transmit their true
    character. Our sheep in tropical countries lose their wool in a few
    generations. There seems also to be a close relation between
    certain peculiar pastures and the inheritance of an enlarged tail
    in fat-tailed sheep, which form one of the most ancient breeds in
    the world. With plants, we have seen that tropical varieties of
    maize lose their proper character in the course of two or three
    generations, when cultivated in Europe; and conversely so it is
    with European varieties cultivated in Brazil. Our cabbages, which
    here come so true by seed, cannot form heads in hot countries.
    According to Carri&#232;re,<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> the
    purple-leafed beech and barberry transmit their character by seed
    far less truly in certain districts than in others. Under changed
    circumstances, periodical habits of life soon fail to be
    transmitted, as the period of maturity in summer and winter wheat,
    barley, and vetches. So it is with animals: for instance, a person,
    whose statement I can trust, procured eggs of Aylesbury ducks from
    that town, where they are kept in houses and are reared as early as
    possible for the London market; the ducks bred from these eggs in a
    distant part of England, hatched their first brood on January 24th,
    whilst common ducks, kept in the same yard and treated in the same
    manner, did not hatch till the end of March; and this shows that
    the period of hatching was inherited. But the grandchildren of
    these Aylesbury ducks completely lost their habit of early
    incubation, and hatched their eggs at the same time with the common
    ducks of the same place.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Many cases of non-inheritance apparently result
    from the conditions of life continually inducing fresh variability.
    We have seen that when the seeds of pears, plums, apples, etc., are
    sown, the seedlings generally inherit some degree of family
    likeness. Mingled with these seedlings, a few, and sometimes many,
    worthless, wild-looking plants commonly appear, and their
    appearance may be attributed to the principle of reversion. But
    scarcely a single seedling will be found perfectly to resemble the
    parent-form; and thus may be accounted for by constantly recurring
    variability induced by the conditions of life. I believe in this,
    because it has been observed that certain fruit-trees truly
    propagate their kind whilst growing on their own roots; but when
    grafted on other stocks, and by this process their natural state is
    manifestly affected, they produce seedlings which vary greatly,
    departing from the parental type in many characters.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> Metzger, as stated in the ninth chapter,
    found that certain kinds of wheat brought from Spain and cultivated
    in Germany, failed during many years to reproduce themselves truly;
    but at last, when accustomed to their new conditions, they ceased
    to be variable,&#8212;that is, they became amenable to the power of
    inheritance. Nearly all the plants which cannot be propagated with
    any approach to certainty by seed, are kinds which have been long
    propagated by buds, cuttings, offsets, tubers, etc., and have in
    consequence been frequently exposed during what may be called their
    individual lives to widely diversified conditions of life. Plants
    thus propagated become so variable, that they are subject, as we
    have seen in the last chapter, even to bud-variation. Our
    domesticated animals, on the other hand, are not commonly exposed
    during the life of the individual to such extremely diversified
    conditions, and are not liable to such extreme variability;
    therefore they do not lose the power of transmitting most of their
    characteristic features. In the foregoing remarks on
    non-inheritance, crossed breeds are of course excluded, as their
    diversity mainly depends on the unequal development of character
    derived from either parent or their ancestors.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Conclusion.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has been shown in the early part of this
    chapter how commonly new characters of the most diversified nature,
    whether normal or abnormal, injurious or beneficial, whether
    affecting organs of the highest or most trifling importance, are
    inherited. It is often sufficient for the inheritance of some
    peculiar character, that one parent alone should possess it, as in
    most cases in which the rarer anomalies have been transmitted. But
    the power of transmission is extremely variable. In a number of
    individuals descended from the same parents, and treated in the
    same manner, some display this power in a perfect manner, and in
    some it is quite deficient; and for this difference no reason can
    be assigned. The effects of injuries or mutilations are
    occasionally inherited; and we shall see in a future chapter that
    the long-continued use and disuse of parts produces an inherited
    effect. Even those characters which are considered the most
    fluctuating, such as colour, are with rare exceptions transmitted
    much more forcibly than is generally supposed. The wonder, indeed,
    in all cases is not that any character should be transmitted, but
    that the power of inheritance should ever fail. The checks to
    inheritance, as far as we know them, are, firstly, circumstances
    hostile to the particular character in question; secondly,
    conditions of life incessantly inducing fresh variability; and
    lastly, the crossing of distinct varieties during some previous
    generation, together with reversion or atavism-that is, the
    tendency in the child to resemble its grand-parents or more remote
    ancestors instead of its immediate parents. This latter subject
    will be discussed in the following chapter.</P>

      History of Mankind.' Dr. Dieffenbach ('Jour. Royal Geograph.
      Soc.,' 1841, p. 208) says this anomaly is not uncommon with the
      Polynesians of the Chatham Islands; and I have heard of several
