    <P align="JUSTIFY">The domesticated races of both animals and
    plants, when crossed, are, with extremely few exceptions, quite
    prolific,&#8212;in some cases even more so than the purely-bred
    parent-races. The offspring, also, raised from such crosses are
    likewise, as we shall see in the following chapter, generally more
    vigorous and fertile than their parents. On the other hand, species
    when crossed, and their hybrid offspring, are almost invariably in
    some degree sterile; and here there seems to exist a broad and
    insuperable distinction between races and species. The importance
    of this subject as bearing on the origin of species is obvious; and
    we shall hereafter recur to it.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate how few precise observations
    have been made on the fertility of mongrel animals and plants
    during several successive generations. Dr. Broca<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> has remarked that no one has observed
    whether, for instance, mongrel dogs, bred inter se, are
    indefinitely fertile; yet, if a shade of infertility be detected by
    careful observation in the offspring of natural forms when crossed,
    it is thought that their specific distinction is proved. But so
    many breeds of sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, and poultry, have been
    crossed and recrossed in various ways, that any sterility, if it
    had existed, would from being injurious almost certainly have been
    observed. In investigating the fertility of crossed varieties many
    sources of doubt occur. Whenever the least trace of sterility
    between two plants, however closely allied, was observed by
    Kolreuter, and more especially by G&#228;rtner, who counted the
    exact number of seed in each capsule, the two forms were at once
    ranked as distinct species; and if this rule be followed, assuredly
    it will never be proved that varieties when crossed are in any
    degree sterile. We have formerly seen that certain breeds of dogs
    do not readily pair together; but no observations have been made
    whether, when paired, they produce the full number of young, and
    whether the latter are perfectly fertile <I>inter se</I>; but,
    supposing that some degree of sterility were found to exist,
    naturalists would simply infer that these breeds were descended
    from aboriginally distinct species; and it would be scarcely
    possible to ascertain whether or not this explanation was the true
    one.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The Sebright Bantam is much less prolific than
    any other breed of fowls, and is descended from a cross between two
    very distinct breeds, recrossed by a third sub-variety. But it
    would be extremely rash to infer that the loss of fertility was in
    any manner connected with its crossed origin, for it may with more
    probability be attributed either to long-continued close
    interbreeding, or to an innate tendency to sterility correlated
    with the absence of hackles and sickle tail-feathers.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Before giving the few recorded cases of forms,
    which must be ranked as varieties, being in some degree sterile
    when crossed, I may remark that other causes sometimes interfere
    with varieties freely intercrossing. Thus they may differ too
    greatly in size, as with some kinds of dogs and fowls: for
    instance, the editor of the 'Journal of Horticulture, etc.'<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> says that he can keep Bantams with the
    larger breeds without much danger of their crossing, but not with
    the smaller breeds, such as Games, Hamburghs, etc. With plants a
    difference in the period of flowering serves to keep varieties
    distinct, as with the various kinds of maize and wheat: thus
    Colonel Le Couteur<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> remarks, "the
    Talavera wheat, from flowering much earlier than any other kind, is
    sure to continue pure." In different parts of the Falkland Islands
    the cattle are breaking up into herds of different colours; and
    those on the higher ground, which are generally white, usually
    breed, as I am informed by Sir J. Sulivan, three months earlier
    than those on the lowland; and this would manifestly tend to keep
    the herds from blending.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Certain domestic races seem to prefer breeding
    with their own kind; and this is a fact of some importance, for it
    is a step towards that instinctive feeling which helps to keep
    closely allied species in a state of nature distinct. We have now
    abundant evidence that, if it were not for this feeling, many more
    hybrids would be naturally produced than in this case. We have seen
    in the first chapter that the alco dog of Mexico dislikes dogs of
    other breeds; and the hairless dog of Paraguay mixes less readily
    with the European races, than the latter do with each other. In
    Germany the female Spitz-dog is said to receive the fox more
    readily than will other dogs; a female Australian Dingo in England
    attracted the wild male foxes. But these differences in the sexual
    instinct and attractive power of the various breeds may be wholly
    due to their descent from distinct species. In Paraguay the horses
    have much freedom, and an excellent observer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> believes that the native horses of the
    same colour and size prefer associating with each other, and that
    the horses which have been imported from Entre Rios and Banda
    Oriental into Paraguay likewise prefer associating together. In
    Circassia six sub-races of the horse have received distinct names;
    and a native proprietor of rank<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
    asserts that horses of three of these races, whilst living a free
    life, almost always refuse to mingle and cross, and will even
    attack one another.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has been observed, in a district stocked with
    heavy Lincolnshire and light Norfolk sheep, that both kinds; though
    bred together, when turned out, "in a short time separate to a
    sheep;" the Lincolnshires drawing off to the rich soil, and the
    Norfolks to their own dry light soil; and as long as there is
    plenty of grass, "the two breeds keep themselves as distinct as
    rooks and pigeons." In this case different habits of life tend to
    keep the races distinct. On one of the Faroe islands, not more than
    half a mile in diameter, the half-wild native black sheep are said
    not to have readily mixed with the imported white sheep. It is a
    more curious fact that the semi-monstrous ancon sheep of modern
    origin "have been observed to keep together, separating themselves
    from the rest of the flock, when put into enclosures with other
    sheep."<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> With respect to
    fallow-deer, which live in a semi-domesticated condition, Mr.
    Bennett<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> states that the dark and
    pale coloured herds, which have long been kept together in the
    Forest of Dean, in High Meadow Woods, and in the New Forest, have
    never been known to mingle: the dark-coloured deer, it may be
    added, are believed to have been first brought by James I. from
    Norway, on account of their greater hardiness. I imported from the
    island of Porto Santo two of the feral rabbits, which differ, as
    described in the fourth chapter, from common rabbits; both proved
    to be males, and, though they lived during some years in the
    Zoological Gardens, the superintendent, Mr. Bartlett, in vain
    endeavoured to make them breed with various tame kinds; but whether
    this refusal to breed was due to any change in the instinct, or
    simply to their extreme wildness, or whether confinement had
    rendered them sterile, as often occurs, cannot be determined.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Whilst matching for the sake of experiment many
    of the most distinct breeds of pigeons, it frequently appeared to
    me that the birds, though faithful to their marriage vow, retained
    some desire after their own kind. Accordingly I asked Mr. Wicking,
    who has kept a larger stock of various breeds together than any man
    in England, whether he thought that they would prefer pairing with
    their own kind, supposing that there were males and females enough
    of each; and he without hesitation answered that he was convinced
    that this was the case. It has often been noticed that the dovecote
    pigeon seems to have an actual aversion towards the several fancy
    breeds<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> yet all have certainly
    sprung from a common progenitor. The Rev. W. D. Fox informs me that
    his flocks of white and common Chinese geese kept distinct.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These facts and statements, though some of them
    are incapable of proof, resting only on the opinion of experienced
    observers, show that some domestic races are led by different
    habits of life to keep to a certain extent separate, and that
    others prefer coupling with their own kind, in the same manner as
    species in a state of nature, though in a much less degree.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>[With respect to sterility from the
    crossing of domestic races, I know of no well-ascertained case with
    animals. This fact, seeing the great difference in structure
    between some breeds of pigeons, fowls, pigs, dogs, etc., is
    extraordinary, in contrast with the sterility of many closely
    allied natural species when crossed; but we shall hereafter attempt
    to show that it is not so extraordinary as it at first appears. And
    it may be well here to recall to mind that the amount of external
    difference between two species is not a safe guide for predicting
    whether or not they will breed together,&#8212;some closely allied
    species when crossed being utterly sterile, and others which are
    extremely unlike being moderately fertile. I have said that no case
    of sterility in crossed races rests on satisfactory evidence; but
    here is one which at first seems trustworthy. Mr. Youatt<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and a better authority cannot be quoted,
    states, that formerly in Lancashire crosses were frequently made
    between longhorn and shorthorn cattle; the first cross was
    excellent, but the produce was uncertain; in the third or fourth
    generation the cows were bad milkers; "in addition to which, there
    was much uncertainty whether the cows would conceive; and full
    one-third of the cows among some of these half-breds failed to be
    in calf." This at first seems a good case: but Mr. Wilkinson
    states,<A href="#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> that a breed derived from
    this same cross was actually established in another part of
    England; and if it had failed in fertility, the fact would surely
    have been noticed. Moreover, supposing that Mr. Youatt had proved
    his case, it might be argued that the sterility was wholly due to
    the two parent-breeds being descended from primordially distinct
    species.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the case of plants G&#228;rtner states
    that he fertilised thirteen heads (and subsequently nine others) on
    a dwarf maize bearing yellow seed<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
    with pollen of a tall maize having red seed; and one head alone
    produced good seed, but only five in number. Though these plants
    are mon&#339;cious, and therefore do not require castration, yet I
    should have suspected some accident in the manipulation, had not
    G&#228;rtner expressly stated that he had during many years grown
    these two varieties together, and they did not spontaneously cross;
    and this, considering that the plants are monoecious and abound
    with pollen, and are well known generally to cross freely, seems
    explicable only on the belief that these two varieties are in some
    degree mutually infertile. The hybrid plants raised from the above
    five seeds were intermediate in structure, extremely variable, and
    perfectly fertile.<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> In like manner
    Prof. Hildebrand<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> could not
    succeed in fertilising the female flowers of a plant bearing brown
    grains with pollen from a certain kind bearing yellow grains;
    although other flowers on the same plant, which were fertilised
    with their own pollen, yielded good seed. No one, I believe, even
    suspects that these varieties of maize are distinct species; but
    had the hybrids been in the least sterile, no doubt G&#228;rtner
    would at once have so classed them. I may here remark, that with
    undoubted species there is not necessarily any close relation
    between the sterility of a first cross and that of the hybrid
    offspring. Some species can be crossed with facility, but produce
    utterly sterile hybrids; others can be crossed with extreme
    difficulty, but the hybrids when produced are moderately fertile. I
    am not aware, however, of any instance quite like this of the
    maize, namely, of a first cross made with difficulty, but yielding
    perfectly fertile hybrids.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The following case is much more
    remarkable, and evidently perplexed G&#228;rtner, whose strong wish
    it was to draw a broad line of distinction between species and
    varieties. In the genus Verbascum, he made, during eighteen years,
    a vast number of experiments, and crossed no less than 1085 flowers
    and counted their seeds. Many of these experiments consisted in
    crossing white and yellow varieties of both <I>V. lychnitis</I> and
    <I>V. blattaria</I> with nine other species and their hybrids. That
    the white and yellow flowered plants of these two species are
    really varieties, no one has doubted; and G&#228;rtner actually
    raised in the case of both species one variety from the seed of the
    other. Now in two of his works<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> he
    distinctly asserts that crosses between similarly-coloured flowers
    yield more seed than between dissimilarly-coloured; so that the
    yellow-flowered variety of either species (and conversely with the
    white-flowered variety), when crossed with pollen of its own kind,
    yields more seed than when crossed with that of the white variety;
    and so it is when differently coloured species are crossed. The
    general results may be seen in the Table at the end of his volume.
    In one instance he gives<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> the
    following details; but I must premise that G&#228;rtner, to avoid
    exaggerating the degree of sterility in his crosses, always
    compares the <I>maximum</I> number obtained from a cross with the
    <I>average</I> number naturally given by the pure mother-plant. The
    white variety of <I>V. lychnitis,</I> naturally fertilised by its
    own pollen, gave from an <I>average</I> of twelve capsules
    ninety-six good seeds in each; whilst twenty flowers fertilised
    with pollen from the yellow variety of this same species, gave as
    the <I>maximum</I> only eighty-nine good seeds; so that we have the
    proportion of 1000 to 908, according to G&#228;rtner's usual scale.
    I should have thought it possible that so small a difference in
    fertility might have been accounted for by the evil effects of the
    necessary castration; but G&#228;rtner shows that the white variety
    of <I>V. lychnitis,</I> when fertilised first by the white variety
    of <I>V. blattaria,</I> and then by the yellow variety of this
    species, yielded seed in the proportion of 622 to 438; and in both
    these cases castration was performed. Now the sterility which
    results from the crossing of the differently coloured varieties of
    the same species, is fully as great as that which occurs in many
    cases when distinct species are crossed. Unfortunately G&#228;rtner
    compared the results of the first unions alone, and not the
    sterility of the two sets of hybrids produced from the white
    variety of <I>V. lychnitis</I> when fertilised by the white and
    yellow varieties of <I>V. blattaria,</I> for it is probable that
    they would have differed in this respect.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Mr. J. Scott has given me the results of
    a series of experiments on Verbascum, made by him in the Botanic
    Gardens of Edinburgh.<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> He repeated
    some of G&#228;rtner's experiments on distinct species, but
    obtained only fluctuating results, some confirmatory, the greater
    number contradictory; nevertheless these seem hardly sufficient to
    overthrow the conclusion arrived at by G&#228;rtner from
    experiments tried on a larger scale. Mr. Scott also experimented on
    the relative fertility of unions between similarly and
    dissimilarly-coloured varieties of the same species. Thus he
    fertilised six flowers of the yellow variety of <I>V. lychnitis</I>
    by its own pollen, and obtained six capsules; and calling, for the
    sake of comparison, the average number of good seed in each of
    their capsules one hundred, he found that this same yellow variety,
    when fertilised by the white variety, yielded from seven capsules
    an average of ninety-four seed. On the same principle, the white
    variety of <I>V. lychnitis</I> by its own pollen (from six
    capsules), and by the pollen of the yellow variety (eight
    capsules), yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 82. The yellow
    variety of <I>V. thapsus</I> by its own pollen (eight capsules),
    and by that of the white variety (only two capsules), yielded seed
    in the proportion of 100 to 94. Lastly, the white variety of <I>V.
    blattaria</I> by its own pollen (eight capsules), and by that of
    the yellow variety (five capsules), yielded seed in the proportion
    of 100 to 79. So that in every case the unions of
    similarly-coloured varieties of the same species were more fertile
    than the unions of dissimilarly-coloured varieties; when all the
    cases are grouped together, the difference of fertility is as 100
    to 86. Some additional trials were made, and altogether thirty-six
    similarly-coloured unions yielded thirty-five good capsules; whilst
    thirty-five dissimilarly-coloured unions yielded only twenty-six
    good capsules. Besides the foregoing experiments, the purple <I>V.
    ph&#339;niceum</I> was crossed by a rose-coloured and a white
    variety of the same species; these two varieties were also crossed
    together, and these several unions yielded less seed than <I>V.
    ph&#339;niceum</I> by its own pollen. Hence it follows from Mr.
    Scott's experiments, that in the genus Verbascum the similarly and
    dissimilarly-coloured varieties of the same species behave, when
    crossed, like closely allied but distinct species.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> This remarkable fact of the sexual
    affinity of similarly-coloured varieties, as observed by
    G&#228;rtner and Mr. Scott, may not be of very rare occurrence; for
    the subject has not been attended to by others. The following case
    is worth giving, partly to show how difficult it is to avoid error.
    Dr. Herbert<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> has remarked that
    variously-coloured double varieties of the Hollyhock (<I>Althea
    rosea</I>) may be raised with certainty by seed from plants growing
    close together. I have been informed that nurserymen who raise seed
    for sale do not separate their plants; accordingly I procured seed
    of eighteen named varieties; of these, eleven varieties produced
    sixty-two plants all perfectly true to their kind; and seven
    produced forty-nine plants, half of which were true and half false.
    Mr. Masters of Canterbury has given me a more striking case; he
    saved seed from a great bed of twenty-four named varieties planted
    in closely adjoining rows, and each variety reproduced itself truly
    with only sometimes a shade of difference in tint. Now in the
    hollyhock the pollen, which is abundant, is matured and nearly all
    shed before the stigma of the same flower is ready to receive it;<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> and as bees covered with pollen
    incessantly fly from plant to plant, it would appear that adjoining
    varieties could not escape being crossed. As, however, this does
    not occur, it appeared to me probable that the pollen of each
    variety was prepotent on its own stigma over that of all other
    varieties, but I have no evidence on this point. Mr. C. Turner of
    Slough, well known for his success in the cultivation of this
    plant, informs me that it is the doubleness of the flowers which
    prevents the bees gaining access to the pollen and stigma; and he
    finds that it is difficult even to cross them artificially. Whether
    this explanation will fully account for varieties in close
    proximity propagating themselves so truly by seed, I do not
    know.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The following cases are worth giving, as
    they relate to monoecious forms, which do not require, and
    consequently cannot have been injured by, castration. Girou de
    Buzareingues crossed what he designates three varieties of gourd,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> and asserts that their mutual
    fertilisation is less easy in proportion to the difference which
    they present. I am aware how imperfectly the forms in this group
    were until recently known; but Sageret,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> who ranked them according to their
    mutual fertility, considers the three forms above alluded to as
    varieties, as does a far higher authority, namely, M. Naudin.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> Sageret<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> has observed that certain melons have a
    greater tendency, whatever the cause may be, to keep true than
    others; and M. Naudin, who has had such immense experience in this
    group, informs me that he believes that certain varieties
    intercross more readily than others of the same species; but he has
    not proved the truth of this conclusion; the frequent abortion of
    the pollen near Paris being one great difficulty. Nevertheless, he
    has grown close together, during seven years, certain forms of
    Citrullus, which, as they could be artificially crossed with
    perfect facility and produced fertile offspring, are ranked as
    varieties; but these forms when not artificially crossed kept true.
    Many other varieties, on the other hand, in the same group cross
    with such facility, as M. Naudin repeatedly insists, that without
    being grown far apart they cannot be kept in the least
    true.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Another case, though somewhat different,
    may be here given, as it is highly remarkable, and is established
    on excellent evidence. Kolreuter minutely describes five varieties
    of the common tobacco<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> which were
    reciprocally crossed, and the offspring were intermediate in
    character and as fertile as their parents: from this fact Kolreuter
    inferred that they are really varieties; and no one, as far as I
    can discover, seems to have doubted that such is the case. He also
    crossed reciprocally these five varieties with <I>N. glutinosa,</I>
    and they yielded very sterile hybrids; but those raised from the
    <I>var. perennis,</I> whether used as the father or mother plant,
    were not so sterile as the hybrids from the four other varieties.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> So that the sexual capacity of this
    one variety has certainly been in some degree modified, so as to
    approach in nature that of <I>N. glutinosa.</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These facts with respect to plants show that in
    some few cases certain varieties have had their sexual powers so
    far modified, that they cross together less readily and yield less
    seed than other varieties of the same species. We shall presently
    see that the sexual functions of most animals and plants are
    eminently liable to be affected by the conditions of life to which
    they are exposed; and hereafter we shall briefly discuss the
    conjoint bearing of this fact, and others, on the difference in
    fertility between crossed varieties and crossed species.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>Domestication eliminates the tendency to Sterility which
      is<BR>
       general with Species when crossed.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This hypothesis was first propounded by
    Pallas,<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> and has been adopted by
    several authors. I can find hardly any direct facts in its support;
    but unfortunately no one has compared, in the case of either
    animals or plants, the fertility of anciently domesticated
    varieties, when crossed with a distinct species, with that of the
    wild parent-species when similarly crossed. No one has compared,
    for instance, the fertility of <I>Gallus bankiva</I> and of the
    domesticated fowl, when crossed with a distinct species of Gallus
    or Phasianus; and the experiment would in all cases be surrounded
    by many difficulties. Dureau de la Malle, who has so closely
    studied classical literature, states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> that in the time of the Romans the
    common mule was produced with more difficulty than at the present
    day; but whether this statement may be trusted I know not. A much
    more important, though somewhat different, case is given by M.
    Groenland,<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> namely, that plants,
    known from their intermediate character and sterility to be hybrids
    between &#198;gilops and wheat, have perpetuated themselves under
    culture since 1857, <I>with a rapid but varying increase of
    fertility in each generation.</I> In the fourth generation the
    plants, still retaining their intermediate character, had become as
    fertile as common cultivated wheat.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The indirect evidence in favour of the Pallasian
    doctrine appears to me to be extremely strong. In the earlier
    chapters I have shown that our various breeds of the dog are
    descended from several wild species; and this probably is the case
    with sheep. There can be no doubt that the Zebu or humped Indian ox
    belongs to a distinct species from European cattle: the latter,
    moreover, are descended from two forms, which may be called either
    species or races. We have good evidence that our domesticated pigs
    belong to at least two specific types, <I>S. scrofa</I> and <I>
    indicus.</I> Now a widely extended analogy leads to the belief that
    if these several allied species, when first reclaimed, had been
    crossed, they would have exhibited, both in their first unions and
    in their hybrid offspring, some degree of sterility. Nevertheless,
    the several domesticated races descended from them are now all, as
    far as can be ascertained, perfectly fertile together. If this
    reasoning be trustworthy, and it is apparently sound, we must admit
    the Pallasian doctrine that long-continued domestication tends to
    eliminate that sterility which is natural to species when crossed
    in their aboriginal state.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>On increased Fertility from Domestication and Cultivation.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Increased fertility from domestication, without
    any reference to crossing, may be here briefly considered. This
    subject bears indirectly on two or three points connected with the
    modification of organic beings. As Buffon long ago remarked,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> domestic animals breed oftener in
    the year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the
    same species; they, also, sometimes breed at an earlier age. The
    case would hardly have deserved further notice, had not some
    authors lately attempted to show that fertility increases and
    decreases in an inverse ratio with the amount of food. This strange
    doctrine has apparently arisen from individual animals when
    supplied with an inordinate quantity of food, and from plants of
    many kinds when grown on excessively rich soil, as on a dunghill,
    becoming sterile: but to this latter point I shall have occasion
    presently to return. With hardly an exception, our domesticated
    animals, which have been long habituated to a regular and copious
    supply of food, without the labour of searching for it, are more
    fertile than the corresponding wild animals. It is notorious how
    frequently cats and dogs breed, and how many young they produce at
    a birth. The wild rabbit is said generally to breed four times
    yearly, and to produce each time at most six young; the tame rabbit
    breeds six or seven times yearly, producing each time from four to
    eleven young; and Mr. Harrison Weir tells me of a case of eighteen
    young having been produced at a birth, all of which survived. The
    ferret, though generally so closely confined, is more prolific than
    its supposed wild prototype. The wild sow is remarkably prolific;
    she often breeds twice in the year, and bears from four to eight
    and sometimes even twelve young; but the domestic sow regularly
    breeds twice a year, and would breed oftener if permitted; and a
    sow that produces less than eight at a birth "is worth little, and
    the sooner she is fattened for the butcher the better." The amount
    of food affects the fertility of the same individual: thus sheep,
    which on mountains never produce more than one lamb at a birth,
    when brought down to lowland pastures frequently bear twins. This
    difference apparently is not due to the cold of the higher land,
    for sheep and other domestic animals are said to be extremely
    prolific in Lapland. Hard living, also, retards the period at which
    animals conceive; for it has been found disadvantageous in the
    northern islands of Scotland to allow cows to bear calves before
    they are four years old.<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Birds offer still better evidence of
    increased fertility from domestication: the hen of the wild <I>
    Gallus bankiva</I> lays from six to ten eggs, a number which would
    be thought nothing of with the domestic hen. The wild duck lays
    from five to ten eggs; the tame one in the course of the year from
    eighty to one hundred. The wild grey-lag goose lays from five to
    eight eggs; the tame from thirteen to eighteen, and she lays a
    second time; as Mr. Dixon has remarked, "high-feeding, care, and
    moderate warmth induce a habit of prolificacy which becomes in some
    measure hereditary." Whether the semi-domesticated dovecote pigeon
    is more fertile than the wild rock-pigeon, C. livia, I know not;
    but the more thoroughly domesticated breeds are nearly twice as
    fertile as dovecotes: the latter, however, when caged and highly
    fed, become equally fertile with house pigeons. I hear from Judge
    Caton that the wild turkey in the United States does not breed when
    a year old, as the domesticated turkeys there invariably do. The
    peahen alone of domesticated birds is rather more fertile,
    according to some accounts, when wild in its native Indian home,
    than in Europe when exposed to our much colder climate.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to plants, no one would
    expect wheat to tiller more, and each ear to produce more grain, in
    poor than in rich soil; or to get in poor soil a heavy crop of peas
    or beans. Seeds vary so much in number that it is difficult to
    estimate them; but on comparing beds of carrots in a nursery garden
    with wild plants, the former seemed to produce about twice as much
    seed. Cultivated cabbages yielded thrice as many pods by measure as
    wild cabbages from the rocks of South Wales. The excess of berries
    produced by the cultivated asparagus in comparison with the wild
    plant is enormous. No doubt many highly cultivated plants, such as
    pears, pineapples, bananas, sugar-cane, etc., are nearly or quite
    sterile; and I am inclined to attribute this sterility to excess of
    food and to other unnatural conditions; but to this subject I shall
    recur.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In some cases, as with the pig, rabbit, etc.,
    and with those plants which are valued for their seed, the direct
    selection of the more fertile individuals has probably much
    increased their fertility; and in all cases this may have occurred
    indirectly, from the better chance of some of the numerous
    offspring from the more fertile individuals having been preserved.
    But with cats, ferrets, and dogs, and with plants like carrots,
    cabbages, and asparagus, which are not valued for their
    prolificacy, selection can have played only a subordinate part; and
    their increased fertility must be attributed to the more favourable
    conditions of life under which they have long existed.</P>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">The following facts, given by K&#246;lreuter in his 'Dritte
      Fortsetzung,' ss. 34, 39, appear at first sight strongly to
      confirm Mr. Scott's and G&#228;rtner's statements; and to a
      certain limited extent they do so. K&#246;lreuter asserts, from
      innumerable observations, that insects incessantly carry pollen
      from one species and variety of Verbascum to another; and I can
      confirm this assertion; yet he found that the white and yellow
      varieties of <I>Verbascum lychnitis</I> often grew wild mingled
      together: moreover, he cultivated these two varieties in
      considerable numbers during four years in his garden, and they
      kept true by seed; but when he crossed them, they produced
      flowers of an intermediate tint. Hence it might have been thought
      that both varieties must have a stronger elective affinity for
      the pollen of their own variety than for that of the other; this
      elective affinity, I may add of each species for its own pollen
      (K&#246;lreuter, 'Dritte Forts.' s. 39, and G&#228;rtner,
      'Bastarderz.,' <I>passim</I>) being a perfectly well-ascertained
      power. But the force of the foregoing facts is much lessened by
      G&#228;rtner's numerous experiments, for, differently from
      K&#246;lreuter, he never once got ('Bastarderz.,' s. 307) an
      intermediate tint when he crossed the yellow and white flowered
      varieties of Verbascum. So that the fact of the white and yellow
      varieties keeping true to their colour by seed does not prove
      that they were not mutually fertilised by the pollen carried by
      insects from one to the other.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">K&#246;lreuter was so much struck with this fact that he

      his experiments might have accidentally got mingled with that of
      <I>var. perennis,</I> and thus aided its fertilising power. But
      we now know conclusively from G&#228;rtner ('Bastarderz.,' s. 34,
      43) that the pollen of two species never acts <I>conjointly</I>
      on a third species; still less will the pollen of a distinct
      species, mingled with a plant's own pollen, if the latter be
      present in sufficient quantity, have any effect. The sole effect
      of mingling two kinds of pollen is to produce in the same capsule
      seeds which yield plants, some taking after the one and some
      after the other parent.</FONT></LI>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">Mr. Scott has made some observations on the absolute
      sterility of a purple and white primrose (<I>Primula
      vulgaris</I>) when fertilised by pollen from the common primrose
      ('Journal of Proc. of Linn. Soc.,' vol. viii., 1864, p. 98); but
      these observations require confirmation. I raised a number of
      purple-flowered long-styled seedlings from seed kindly sent me by
      Mr. Scott, and, though they were all in some degree sterile, they
      were much more fertile with pollen taken from the common primrose
      than with their own pollen. Mr. Scott has likewise described a
      red equal-styled cowslip (<I>P. veris,</I> ibid. p. 106), which
      was found by him to be highly sterile when crossed with the
      common cowslip; but this was not the case with several
      equal-styled red seedlings raised by me from his plant. This
      variety of the cowslip presents the remarkable peculiarity of
      combining male organs in every respect like those of the
      short-styled form, with female organs resembling in function and
      partly in structure those of the long-styled form; so that we
      have the singular anomaly of the two forms combined in the same
      flower. Hence it is not surprising that these flowers should be
      spontaneously self-fertile in a high degree.</FONT></LI>
