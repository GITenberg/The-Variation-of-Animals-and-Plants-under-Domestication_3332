    <P align="JUSTIFY">The breeds of the pig have recently been more
    closely studied, though much still remains to be done, than those
    of almost any other domesticated animal. This has been effected by
    Hermann von Nathusius in two admirable works, especially in the
    later one on the Skulls of the several races, and by R&#252;timeyer
    in his celebrated Fauna of the ancient Swiss lake-dwellings.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> Nathusius has shown that all the
    known breeds may be divided into two great groups: one resembling
    in all important respects and no doubt descended from the common
    wild boar; so that this may be called the <I>Sus scrofa</I> group.
    The other group differs in several important and constant
    osteological characters; its wild parent-form is unknown; the name
    given to it by Nathusius, according to the law of priority, is <I>
    Sus indicus,</I> of Pallas. This name must now be followed, though
    an unfortunate one, as the wild aboriginal does not inhabit India,
    and the best-known domesticated breeds have been imported from Siam
    and China.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">First for the <I>Sus scrofa</I> breeds, or those
    resembling the common wild boar. These still exist, according to
    Nathusius ('Schweinesch&#228;del' s. 75), in various parts of
    central and northern Europe; formerly every kingdom,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> and almost every province in Britain,
    possessed its own native breed; but these are now everywhere
    rapidly disappearing, being replaced by improved breeds crossed
    with the <I>S. indicus</I> form. The skull in the breeds of the <I>
    S. scrofa</I> type resembles, in all important respects, that of
    the European wild boar; but it has become ('Schweinesch&#228;del'
    s. 63-68) higher and broader relatively to its length; and the
    hinder part is more upright. The differences, however, are all
    variable in degree. The breeds which thus resemble <I>S. scrofa</I>
    in their essential skull characters differ conspicuously from each
    other in other respects, as in the length of the ears and legs,
    curvature of the ribs, colour, hairiness, size and proportions of
    the body.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The wild <I>Sus scrofa</I> has a wide range,
    namely, Europe, North Africa, as identified by osteological
    characters by R&#252;timeyer, and Hindostan, as similarly
    identified by Nathusius. But the wild boars inhabiting these
    several countries differ so much from each other in external
    characters, that they have been ranked by some naturalists as
    specifically distinct. Even within Hindostan these animals,
    according to Mr. Blyth, form very distinct races in the different
    districts; in the N. Western provinces, as I am informed by the
    Rev. R. Everest, the boar never exceeds 36 inches in height, whilst
    in Bengal one has been measured 44 inches in height. In Europe,
    Northern Africa, and Hindostan, domestic pigs have been known to
    cross with the wild native species;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and in Hindostan an accurate observer,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Sir Walter Elliot, after describing
    the differences between wild Indian and wild German boars, remarks
    that "the same differences are perceptible in the domesticated
    individuals of the two countries." We may therefore conclude that
    the breeds of the <I>Sus scrofa</I> type are descended from, or
    have been modified by crossing with, forms which may be ranked as
    geographical races, but which, according to some naturalists, ought
    to be ranked as distinct species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Pigs of the <I>Sus indicus</I> type are best
    known to Englishmen under the form of the Chinese breed. The skull
    of <I>S. indicus,</I> as described by Nathusius, differs from that
    of <I>S. scrofa</I> in several minor respects, as in its greater
    breadth and in some details in the teeth; but chiefly in the
    shortness of the lachrymal bones, in the greater width of the fore
    part of the palate-bones, and in the divergence of the premolar
    teeth. It deserves especial notice that these latter characters are
    not gained, even in the least degree, by the domesticated forms of
    <I>S. scrofa.</I> After reading the remarks and descriptions given
    by Nathusius, it seems to me to be merely playing with words to
    doubt whether <I>S. indicus</I> ought to be ranked as a species;
    for the above-specified differences are more strongly marked than
    any that can be pointed out between, for instance, the fox and the
    wolf, or the ass and the horse. As already stated, <I>S.
    indicus</I> is not known in a wild state; but its domesticated
    forms, according to Nathusius, come near to <I>S. vittatus</I> of
    Java and some allied species. A pig found wild in the Aru islands
    ('Schweinesch&#228;del' s. 169) is apparently identical with <I>S.
    indicus</I>; but it is doubtful whether this is a truly native
    animal. The domesticated breeds of China, Cochin-China, and Siam
    belong to this type. The Roman or Neapolitan breed, the Andalusian,
    the Hungarian, and the "Krause" swine of Nathusius, inhabiting
    south-eastern Europe and Turkey, and having fine curly hair, and
    the small Swiss "B&#252;ndtnerschwein" of R&#252;timeyer, all agree
    in their more important skull-characters with <I>S. indicus,</I>
    and, as is supposed, have all been largely crossed with this form.
    Pigs of this type have existed during a long period on the shores
    of the Mediterranean, for a figure ('Schweinesch&#228;del' s. 142)
    closely resembling the existing Neapolitan pig was found in the
    buried city of Herculaneum.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">R&#252;timeyer has made the remarkable discovery
    that there lived contemporaneously in Switzerland, during the
    Neolithic period, two domesticated forms, the <I>S. scrofa,</I> and
    the <I>S. scrofa palustris</I> or Torfschwein. R&#252;timeyer
    perceived that the latter approached the Eastern breeds, and,
    according to Nathusius, it certainly belongs to the <I>S.
    indicus</I> group; but R&#252;timeyer has subsequently shown that
    it differs in some well-marked characters. This author was formerly
    convinced that his Torfschwein existed as a wild animal during the
    first part of the Stone period, and was domesticated during a later
    part of the same period.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
    Nathusius, whilst he fully admits the curious fact first observed
    by R&#252;timeyer, that the bones of domesticated and wild animals
    can be distinguished by their different aspect, yet, from special
    difficulties in the case of the bones of the pig
    ('Schweinesch&#228;del' s. 147), is not convinced of the truth of
    the above conclusion; and R&#252;timeyer himself seems now to feel
    some doubt. Other naturalists have also argued strongly on the same
    side as Nathusius.<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Several breeds, differing in the proportions of
    the body, in the length of the ears, in the nature of the hair, in
    colour, etc., come under the <I>S. indicus</I> type. Nor is this
    surprising, considering how ancient the domestication of this form
    has been both in Europe and in China. In this latter country the
    date is believed by an eminent Chinese scholar<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> to go back at least 4900 years from the
    present time. This same scholar alludes to the existence of many
    local varieties of the pig in China; and at the present time the
    Chinese take extraordinary pains in feeding and tending their pigs,
    not even allowing them to walk from place to place.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> Hence these pigs, as Nathusius has
    remarked,<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> display in an eminent
    degree the characters of a highly-cultivated race, and hence, no
    doubt, their high value in the improvement of our European breeds.
    Nathusius makes a remarkable statement ('Schweinesch&#228;del' s.
    138), that the infusion of the 1/32nd, or even of the 1/64th, part
    of the blood of <I>S. indicus</I> into a breed of <I>S. scrofa,</I>
    is sufficient plainly to modify the skull of the latter species.
    This singular fact may perhaps be accounted for by several of the
    chief distinctive characters of <I>S. indicus,</I> such as the
    shortness of the lachrymal bones, etc., being common to several
    species of the genus; for in crosses characters which are common to
    many species apparently tend to be prepotent over those
    appertaining to only a few species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The Japan pig (<I>S. pliciceps</I> of Gray),
    which was formerly exhibited in the Zoological Gardens, has an
    extraordinary appearance from its short head, broad forehead and
    nose, great fleshy ears, and deeply furrowed skin. Figure 2 is
    copied from that given by Mr. Bartlett.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Not only is the face furrowed, but thick
    folds of skin, which are harder than the other parts, almost like
    the plates on the Indian rhinoceros, hang about the shoulders and
    rump. It is coloured black, with white feet, and breeds true. That
    it has long been domesticated there can be little doubt; and this
    might have been inferred even from the fact that its young are not
    longitudinally striped; for this is a character common to all the
    species included within the genus <I>Sus</I> and the allied genera
    whilst in their natural state.<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
    Dr. Gray<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> has described the skull
    of this animal, which he ranks not only as a distinct species, but
    places it in a distinct section of the genus. Nathusius, however,
    after his careful study of the whole group, states positively
    ('Schweinesch&#228;del' s. 153-158). that the skull in all
    essential characters closely resembles that of the short-eared
    Chinese breed of the <I>S. indicus</I> type. Hence Nathusius
    considers the Japan pig as only a domesticated variety of <I>S.
    indicus</I>: if this really be the case, it is a wonderful instance
    of the amount of modification which can be effected under
    domestication.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Formerly there existed in the central islands of
    the Pacific Ocean a singular breed of pigs. These are described by
    the Rev. D. Tyerman and G. Bennett<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> as of small size, hump-backed, with a
    disproportionately long head, with short ears turned backwards,
    with a bushy tail not more than two inches in length, placed as if
    it grew from the back. Within half a century after the introduction
    of European and Chinese pigs into these islands, the native breed,
    according to the above authors, became almost completely lost by
    being repeatedly crossed with them. Secluded islands, as might have
    been expected, seem favourable for the production or retention of
    peculiar breeds; thus, in the Orkney Islands, the hogs have been
    described as very small, with erect and sharp ears, and "with an
    appearance altogether different from the hogs brought from the
    south."<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Seeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging
    to the <I>Sus indicus</I> type, are in their osteological
    characters and in external appearance from the pigs of the <I>S.
    scrofa</I> type, so that they must be considered specifically
    distinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that Chinese and
    common pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various manners, with
    unimpaired fertility. One great breeder who had used pure Chinese
    pigs assured me that the fertility of the half-breeds <I>inter
    se</I> and of their recrossed progeny was actually increased; and
    this is the general belief of agriculturists. Again, the Japan pig
    or <I>S. pliciceps</I> of Gray is so distinct in appearance from
    all common pigs, that it stretches one's belief to the utmost to
    admit that it is simply a domestic variety; yet this breed has been
    found perfectly fertile with the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton
    informs me that he paired a half-bred brother and sister and found
    them quite fertile together.</P>
    <IMG alt=
    "Fig. 3&#8212;Head of Wild Boar, and of 'Golden Days,' a pig of the Yorkshire Large Breed"
     src="../Images/fig3.jpg" width="235" height="561" align="RIGHT">

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The modification of the skull in the most highly
    cultivated races is wonderful. To appreciate the amount of change,
    Nathusius' work, with its excellent figures, should be studied. The
    whole of the exterior in all its parts has been altered: the hinder
    surface, instead of sloping backwards, is directed forwards,
    entailing many changes in other parts; the front of the head is
    deeply concave; the orbits have a different shape; the auditory
    meatus has a different direction and shape; the incisors of the
    upper and lower jaws do not touch each other, and they stand in
    both jaws beyond the plane of the molars; the canines of the upper
    jaw stand in front of those of the lower jaw, and this is a
    remarkable anomaly: the articular surfaces of the occipital
    condyles are so greatly changed in shape, that, as Nathusius
    remarks (s. 133), no naturalist, seeing this important part of the
    skull by itself, would suppose that it belonged to the genus Sus.
    These and various other modifications, as Nathusius observes, can
    hardly be considered as monstrosities, for they are not injurious,
    and are strictly inherited. The whole head is much shortened; thus,
    whilst in common breeds its length to that of the body is as 1 to
    6, in the "cultur-racen" the proportion is as 1 to 9, and even
    recently as 1 to 11.<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> The woodcut
    (Figure 3) of the head of a wild boar and of a sow from a
    photograph of the Yorkshire Large Breed, may aid in showing how
    greatly the head in a highly cultivated race has been modified and
    shortened.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Nathusius has well discussed the causes of the
    remarkable changes in the skull and shape of the body which the
    highly cultivated races have undergone. These modifications occur
    chiefly in the pure and crossed races of the <I>S. indicus</I>
    type; but their commencement may be clearly detected in the
    slightly improved breeds of the <I>S. scrofa</I> type.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> Nathusius states positively (s. 99,
    103), as the result of common experience and of his experiments,
    that rich and abundant food, given during youth, tends by some
    direct action to make the head broader and shorter; and that poor
    food works a contrary result. He lays much stress on the fact that
    all wild and semi-domesticated pigs, in ploughing up the ground
    with their muzzles, have, whilst young, to exert the powerful
    muscles fixed to the hinder part of the head. In highly cultivated
    races this habit is no longer followed, and consequently the back
    of the skull becomes modified in shape, entailing other changes in
    other parts. There can hardly be a doubt that so great a change in
    habits would affect the skull; but it seems rather doubtful how far
    this will account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and
    for its concave front. It is well known (Nathusius himself
    advancing many cases, s. 104) that there is a strong tendency in
    many domestic animals&#8212;in bull- and pug-dogs, in the niata
    cattle, in sheep, in Polish fowls, short-faced tumbler pigeons, and
    in one variety of the carp&#8212;for the bones of the face to
    become greatly shortened. In the case of the dog, as H. M&#252;ller
    has shown, this seems caused by an abnormal state of the primordial
    cartilage. We may, however, readily admit that abundant and rich
    food supplied during many generations would give an inherited
    tendency to increased size of body, and that, from disuse, the
    limbs would become finer and shorter.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> We shall in a future chapter see also
    that the skull and limbs are apparently in some manner correlated,
    so that any change in the one tends to affect the other.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Nathusius has remarked, and the observation is
    an interesting one, that the peculiar form of the skull and body in
    the most highly cultivated races is not characteristic of any one
    race, but is common to all when improved up to the same standard.
    Thus the large-bodied, long-eared, English breeds with a convex
    back, and the small-bodied, short-eared, Chinese breeds with a
    concave back, when bred to the same state of perfection, nearly
    resemble each other in the form of the head and body. This result,
    it appears, is partly due to similar causes of change acting on the
    several races, and partly to man breeding the pig for one sole
    purpose, namely, for the greatest amount of flesh and fat; so that
    selection has always tended towards one and the same end. With most
    domestic animals the result of selection has been divergence of
    character, here it has been convergence.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The nature of the food supplied during many
    generations has apparently affected the length of the intestines;
    for, according to Cuvier, their length to that of the body in the
    wild boar is as 9 to 1,&#8212;in the common domestic boar as
    13&#183;5 to 1,&#8212;and in the Siam breed as 16 to 1. In this
    latter breed the greater length may be due either to descent from a
    distinct species or to more ancient domestication. The number of
    mamm&#230; vary, as does the period of gestation. The latest
    authority says<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> that "the period
    averages from 17 to 20 weeks," but I think there must be some error
    in this statement: in M. Tessier's observations on 25 sows it
    varied from 109 to 123 days. The Rev. W. D. Fox has given me ten
    carefully recorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period
    varied from 101 to 116 days. According to Nathusius the period is
    shortest in the races which come early to maturity; but the course
    of their development does not appear to be actually shortened, for
    the young animal is born, judging from the state of the skull, less
    fully developed, or in a more embryonic condition,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> than in the case of common swine. In the
    highly cultivated and early matured races the teeth, also, are
    developed earlier.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The difference in the number of the
    vertebr&#230; and ribs in different kinds of pigs, as observed by
    Mr. Eyton,<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> and as given in the
    following table, has often been quoted. The African sow probably
    belongs to the <I>S. scrofa</I> type; and Mr. Eyton informs me
    that, since the publication of this paper, cross-bred animals from
    the African and English races were found by Lord Hill to be
    perfectly fertile.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some semi-monstrous breeds deserve notice. From
    the time of Aristotle to the present time solid-hoofed swine have
    occasionally been observed in various parts of the world. Although
    this peculiarity is strongly inherited, it is hardly probable that
    all the animals with solid hoofs have descended from the same
    parents; it is more probable that the same peculiarity has
    reappeared at various times and places. Dr. Struthers has lately
    described and figured<A href="#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> the
    structure of the feet; in both front and hind feet the distal
    phalanges of the two greater toes are represented by a single,
    great, hoof-bearing phalanx; and in the front feet, the middle
    phalanges are represented by a bone which is single towards the
    lower end, but bears two separate articulations towards the upper
    end. From other accounts it appears that an intermediate toe is
    likewise sometimes superadded.</P>

      "../Images/fig4.jpg" width="322" height="220">
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Another curious anomaly is offered by the
    appendages, described by M. Eudes-Deslongchamps as often
    characterizing the Normandy pigs. These appendages are always
    attached to the same spot, to the corners of the jaw; they are
    cylindrical, about three inches in length, covered with bristles,
    and with a pencil of bristles rising out of a sinus on one side:
    they have a cartilaginous centre, with two small longitudinal
    muscles they occur either symmetrically on both sides of the face
    or on one side alone. Richardson figures them on the gaunt old
    "Irish Greyhound pig;" and Nathusius states that they occasionally
    appear in all the long eared races, but are not strictly inherited,
    for they occur or fail in animals of the same litter.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> As no wild pigs are known to have
    analogous appendages, we have at present no reason to suppose that
    their appearance is due to reversion; and if this be so, we are
    forced to admit that a somewhat complex, though apparently useless,
    structure may be suddenly developed without the aid of
    selection.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is a remarkable fact that the boars of all
    domesticated breeds have much shorter tusks than wild boars. Many
    facts show that with many animals the state of the hair is much
    affected by exposure to, or protection from, climate; and as we see
    that the state of the hair and teeth are correlated in Turkish dogs
    (other analogous facts will be hereafter given), may we not venture
    to surmise that the reduction of the tusks in the domestic boar is
    related to his coat of bristles being diminished from living under
    shelter? On the other hand, as we shall immediately see, the tusks
    and bristles reappear with feral boars, which are no longer
    protected from the weather. It is not surprising that the tusks
    should be more affected than the other teeth; as parts developed to
    serve as secondary sexual characters are always liable to much
    variation.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is a well-known fact that the young of wild
    European and Indian pigs,<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> for the
    first six months, are longitudinally banded with light-coloured
    stripes. This character generally disappears under domestication.
    The Turkish domestic pigs, however, have striped young, as have
    those of Westphalia, "whatever may be their hue;"<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> whether these latter pigs belong to the
    same curly-haired race as the Turkish swine, I do not know. The
    pigs which have run wild in Jamaica and the semi-feral pigs of New
    Granada, both those which are black and those which are black with
    a white band across the stomach, often extending over the back,
    have resumed this aboriginal character and produce
    longitudinally-striped young. This is likewise the case, at least
    occasionally, with the neglected pigs in the Zambesi settlement on
    the coast of Africa.<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The common belief that all domesticated animals,
    when they run wild, revert completely to the character of their
    parent-stock, is chiefly founded, as far as I can discover, on
    feral pigs. But even in this case the belief is not grounded on
    sufficient evidence; for the two main types, namely, <I>S.
    scrofa</I> and <I>indicus,</I> have not been distinguished. The
    young, as we have just seen, reacquire their longitudinal stripes,
    and the boars invariably reassume their tusks. They revert also in
    the general shape of their bodies, and in the length of their legs
    and muzzles, to the state of the wild animal, as might have been
    expected from the amount of exercise which they are compelled to
    take in search of food. In Jamaica the feral pigs do not acquire
    the full size of the European wild boar, "never attaining a greater
    height than 20 inches at the shoulder." In various countries they
    reassume their original bristly covering, but in different degrees,
    dependent on the climate; thus, according to Roulin, the semi-feral
    pigs in the hot valleys of New Granada are very scantily clothed;
    whereas, on the Paramos, at the height of 7000 to 8000 feet, they
    acquire a thick covering of wool lying under the bristles, like
    that on the truly wild pigs of France. These pigs on the Paramos
    are small and stunted. The wild boar of India is said to have the
    bristles at the end of its tail arranged like the plumes of an
    arrow, whilst the European boar has a simple tuft; and it is a
    curious fact that many, but not all, of the feral pigs in Jamaica,
    derived from a Spanish stock, have a plumed tail.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> With respect to colour, feral pigs
    generally revert to that of the wild boar; but in certain parts of
    S. America, as we have seen, some of the semi-feral pigs have a
    curious white band across their stomachs; and in certain other hot
    places the pigs are red, and this colour has likewise occasionally
    been observed in the feral pigs of Jamaica. From these several
    facts we see that with pigs when feral there is a strong tendency
    to revert to the wild type; but that this tendency is largely
    governed by the nature of the climate, amount of exercise, and
    other causes of change to which they have been subjected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The last point worth notice is that we have
    unusually good evidence of breeds of pigs now keeping perfectly
    true, which have been formed by the crossing of several distinct
    breeds. The Improved Essex pigs, for instance, breed very true; but
    there is no doubt that they largely owe their present excellent
    qualities to crosses originally made by Lord Western with the
    Neapolitan race, and to subsequent crosses with the Berkshire breed
    (this also having been improved by Neapolitan crosses), and
    likewise, probably, with the Sussex breed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> In breeds thus formed by complex
    crosses, the most careful and unremitting selection during many
    generations has been found to be indispensable. Chiefly in
    consequence of so much crossing, some well-known breeds have
    undergone rapid changes; thus, according to Nathusius,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> the Berkshire breed of 1780 is quite
    different from that of 1810; and, since this latter period, at
    least two distinct forms have borne the same name.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H2>CATTLE.</H2>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Domestic cattle are certainly the descendants of
    more than one wild form, in the same manner as has been shown to be
    the case with our dogs and pigs. Naturalists have generally made
    two main divisions of cattle: the humped kinds inhabiting tropical
    countries, called in India Zebus, to which the specific name of <I>
    Bos indicus</I> has been given; and the common non-humped cattle,
    generally included under the name of <I>Bos taurus.</I> The humped
    cattle were domesticated, as may be seen on the Egyptian monuments,
    at least as early as the twelfth dynasty, that is 2100 B.C. They
    differ from common cattle in various osteological characters, even
    in a greater degree, according to R&#252;timeyer,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> than do the fossil and prehistoric
    European species, namely, <I>Bos primigenius</I> and <I>
    longifrons,</I> from each other. They differ, also, as Mr. Blyth,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> who has particularly attended to
    this subject, remarks, in general configuration, in the shape of
    their ears, in the point where the dewlap commences, in the typical
    curvature of their horns, in their manner of carrying their heads
    when at rest, in their ordinary variations of colour, especially in
    the frequent presence of "nilgau-like markings on their feet," and
    "in the one being born with teeth protruding through the jaws, and
    the other not so." They have different habits, and their voice is
    entirely different. The humped cattle in India "seldom seek shade,
    and never go into the water and there stand knee-deep, like the
    cattle of Europe." They have run wild in parts of Oude and
    Rohilcund, and can maintain themselves in a region infested by
    tigers. They have given rise to many races differing greatly in
    size, in the presence of one or two humps, in length of horns, and
    other respects. Mr. Blyth sums up emphatically that the humped and
    humpless cattle must be considered as distinct species. When we
    consider the number of points in external structure and habits,
    independently of important osteological differences, in which they
    differ from each other; and that many of these points are not
    likely to have been affected by domestication, there can hardly be
    a doubt, notwithstanding the adverse opinion of some naturalists,
    that the humped and non-humped cattle must be ranked as
    specifically distinct.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The European breeds of humpless cattle are
    numerous. Professor Low enumerates 19 British breeds, only a few of
    which are identical with those on the Continent. Even the small
    Channel islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and Alderney possess their own
    sub-breeds;<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> and these again
    differ from the cattle of the other British islands, such as
    Anglesea, and the western isles of Scotland. Desmarest, who paid
    attention to the subject, describes 15 French races, excluding
    sub-varieties and those imported from other countries. In other
    parts of Europe there are several distinct races, such as the
    pale-coloured Hungarian cattle, with their light and free step, and
    enormous horns sometimes measuring above five feet from tip to
    tip:<A href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> the Podolian cattle also are
    remarkable from the height of their fore-quarters. In the most
    recent work on Cattle,<A href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> engravings
    are given of fifty-five European breeds; it is, however, probable
    that several of these differ very little from each other, or are
    merely synonyms. It must not be supposed that numerous breeds of
    cattle exist only in long-civilised countries, for we shall
    presently see that several kinds are kept by the savages of
    Southern Africa.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1">With respect to the parentage of
    the several European breeds, we already know much from Nilsson's
    Memoir,<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> and more especially from
    R&#252;timeyer's works and those of Boyd Dawkins. Two or three
    species or forms of Bos, closely allied to still living domestic
    races, have been found in the more recent tertiary deposits or
    amongst prehistoric remains in Europe. Following R&#252;timeyer, we
    have:&#8212;</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1"><I>Bos primigenius.</I>This
    magnificent, well known species was domesticated in Switzerland
    during the Neolithic period; even at this early period it varied a
    little, having apparently been crossed with other races. Some of
    the larger races on the Continent, as the Friesland, etc., and the
    Pembroke race in England, closely resemble in essential structure
    <I>B. primigenius,</I> and no doubt are its descendants. This is
    likewise the opinion of Nilsson. <I>Bos primigenius</I> existed as
    a wild animal in C&#230;sar's time, and is now semi-wild, though
    much degenerated in size, in the park of Chillingham; for I am
    informed by Professor R&#252;timeyer, to whom Lord Tankerville sent
    a skull, that the Chillingham cattle are less altered from the true
    primigenius type than any other known breed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A></FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1"><I>Bos trochoceros.</I> This
    form is not included in the three species above mentioned, for it
    is now considered by R&#252;timeyer to be the female of an early
    domesticated form of <I>B. primigenius,</I> and as the progenitor
    of his <I>frontosus</I> race. I may add that specific names have
    been given to four other fossil oxen, now believed to be identical
    with <I>B. primigenius.</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A></FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1"><I>Bos longifrons</I> (or <I>
    brachyceros</I>) of Owen.&#8212;This very distinct species was of
    small size, and had a short body with fine legs. According to Boyd
    Dawkins<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> it was introduced as a
    domesticated animal into Britain at a very early period, and
    supplied food to the Roman legionaries.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Some remains have been found in Ireland
    in certain crannoges, of which the dates are believed to be from
    843-933 A.D.<A href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> It was also the
    commonest form in a domesticated condition in Switzerland during
    the earliest part of the Neolithic period. Professor Owen<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> thinks it probable that the Welsh and
    Highland cattle are descended from this form; as likewise is the
    case, according to R&#252;timeyer, with some of the existing Swiss
    breeds. These latter are of different shades of colour from
    light-grey to blackish-brown, with a lighter stripe along the
    spine, but they have no pure white marks. The cattle of North Wales
    and the Highlands, on the other hand, are generally black or
    dark-coloured.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT size="-1"><I>Bos frontosus</I> of
    Nilsson.&#8212;This species is allied to <I>B. longifrons,</I> and,
    according to the high authority of Mr. Boyd Dawkins, is identical
    with it, but in the opinion of some judges is distinct. Both
    co-existed in Scania during the same late geological period,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> and both have been found in the
    Irish crannoges.<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> Nilsson believes
    that his <I>B. frontosus</I> may be the parent of the mountain
    cattle of Norway, which have a high protuberance on the skull
    between the base of the horns. As Professor Owen and others believe
    that the Scotch Highland cattle are descended from his <I>B.
    longifrons,</I> it is worth notice that a capable judge<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> has remarked that he saw no cattle in
    Norway like the Highland breed, but that they more nearly resembled
    the Devonshire breed.</FONT></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the whole we may conclude, more especially
    from the researches of Boyd Dawkins, that European cattle are
    descended from two species; and there is no improbability in this
    fact, for the genus Bos readily yields to domestication. Besides
    these two species and the zebu, the yak, the gayal, and the arni<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> (not to mention the buffalo or
    genus Bubalus) have been domesticated; making altogether six
    species of Bos. The zebu and the two European species are now
    extinct in a wild state. Although certain races of cattle were
    domesticated at a very ancient period in Europe, it does not follow
    that they were first domesticated here. Those who place much
    reliance on philology argue that they were imported from the
    East.<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> It is probable that they
    originally inhabited a temperate or cold climate, but not a land
    long covered with snow; for our cattle, as we have seen in the
    chapter on Horses, have not the instinct of scraping away the snow
    to get at the herbage beneath. No one could behold the magnificent
    wild bulls on the bleak Falkland Islands in the southern
    hemisphere, and doubt about the climate being admirably suited to
    them. Azara has remarked that in the temperate regions of La Plata
    the cows conceive when two years old, whilst in the much hotter
    country of Paraguay they do not conceive till three years old;
    "from which fact," as he adds, "one may conclude that cattle do not
    succeed so well in warm countries."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Bos primigenius</I> and <I>longifrons</I>
    have been ranked by nearly all pal&#230;ontologists as distinct
    species; and it would not be reasonable to take a different view
    simply because their domesticated descendants now intercross with
    the utmost freedom. All the European breeds have so often been
    crossed both intentionally and unintentionally, that, if any
    sterility had ensued from such unions, it would certainly have been
    detected. As zebus inhabit a distant and much hotter region, and as
    they differ in so many characters from our European cattle, I have
    taken pains to ascertain whether the two forms are fertile when
    crossed. The late Lord Powis imported some zebus and crossed them
    with common cattle in Shropshire; and I was assured by his steward
    that the cross-bred animals were perfectly fertile with both
    parent-stocks. Mr. Blyth informs me that in India hybrids, with
    various proportions of either blood, are quite fertile; and this
    can hardly fail to be known, for in some districts<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> the two species are allowed to breed
    freely together. Most of the cattle which were first introduced
    into Tasmania were humped, so that at one time thousands of crossed
    animals existed there; and Mr. B. O'Neile Wilson, M.A., writes to
    me from Tasmania that he has never heard of any sterility having
    been observed. He himself formerly possessed a herd of such crossed
    cattle, and all were perfectly fertile; so much so, that he cannot
    remember even a single cow failing to calve. These several facts
    afford an important confirmation of the Pallasian doctrine that the
    descendants of species which when first domesticated would if
    crossed have been in all probability in some degree sterile, become
    perfectly fertile after a long course of domestication. In a future
    chapter we shall see that this doctrine throws some light on the
    difficult subject of Hybridism.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have alluded to the cattle in Chillingham
    Park, which, according to R&#252;timeyer, have been very little
    changed from the <I>Bos primigenius</I> type. This park is so
    ancient that it is referred to in a record of the year 1220. The
    cattle in their instincts and habits are truly wild. They are
    white, with the inside of the ears reddish-brown, eyes rimmed with
    black, muzzles brown, hoofs black, and horns white tipped with
    black. Within a period of thirty-three years about a dozen calves
    were born with "brown and blue spots upon the cheeks or necks; but
    these, together with any defective animals, were always destroyed."
    According to Bewick, about the year 1770 some calves appeared with
    black ears; but these were also destroyed by the keeper, and black
    ears have not since reappeared. The wild white cattle in the Duke
    of Hamilton's park, where I have heard of the birth of a black
    calf, are said by Lord Tankerville to be inferior to those at
    Chillingham. The cattle kept until the year 1780 by the Duke of
    Queensberry, but now extinct, had their ears, muzzle, and orbits of
    the eyes black. Those which have existed from time immemorial at
    Chartley, closely resemble the cattle at Chillingham, but are
    larger, "with some small difference in the colour of the ears."
    "They frequently tend to become entirely black; and a singular
    superstition prevails in the vicinity that, when a black calf is
    born, some calamity impends over the noble house of Ferrers. All
    the black calves are destroyed." The cattle at Burton Constable in
    Yorkshire, now extinct, had ears, muzzle, and the tip of the tail
    black. Those at Gisburne, also in Yorkshire, are said by Bewick to
    have been sometimes without dark muzzles, with the inside alone of
    the ears brown; and they are elsewhere said to have been low in
    stature and hornless.<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The several above-specified differences in the
    park-cattle, slight though they be, are worth recording, as they
    show that animals living nearly in a state of nature, and exposed
    to nearly uniform conditions, if not allowed to roam freely and to
    cross with other herds, do not keep as uniform as truly wild
    animals. For the preservation of a uniform character, even within
    the same park, a certain degree of selection&#8212;that is, the
    destruction of the dark-coloured calves&#8212;is apparently
    necessary.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Boyd Dawkins believes that the park-cattle are
    descended from anciently domesticated, and not truly wild animals;
    and from the occasional appearance of dark-coloured calves, it is
    improbable that the aboriginal <I>Bos primigenius</I> was white. It
    is curious what a strong, though not invariable, tendency there is
    in wild or escaped cattle to become white with coloured ears, under
    widely different conditions of life. If the old writers Boethius
    and Leslie<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> can be trusted, the
    wild cattle of Scotland were white and furnished with a great mane;
    but the colour of their ears is not mentioned. In Wales,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> during the tenth century, some of the
    cattle are described as being white with red ears. Four hundred
    cattle thus coloured were sent to King John; and an early record
    speaks of a hundred cattle with red ears having been demanded as a
    compensation for some offence, but, if the cattle were of a dark or
    black colour, 150 were to be presented. The black cattle of North
    Wales apparently belong, as we have seen, to the small <I>
    longifrons</I> type: and as the alternative was offered of either
    150 dark cattle, or 100 white cattle with red ears, we may presume
    that the latter were the larger beasts, and probably belonged to
    the <I>primigenius</I> type. Youatt has remarked that at the
    present day, whenever cattle of the shorthorn breed are white, the
    extremities of their ears are more or less tinged with red.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The cattle which have run wild on the Pampas, in
    Texas, and in two parts of Africa, have become of a nearly uniform
    dark brownish-red.<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> On the Ladrone
    Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, immense herds of cattle, which were
    wild in the year 1741, are described as "milk-white, except their
    ears, which are generally black."<A href="#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
    The Falkland Islands, situated far south, with all the conditions
    of life as different as it is possible to conceive from those of
    the Ladrones, offer a more interesting case. Cattle have run wild
    there during eighty or ninety years; and in the southern districts
    the animals are mostly white, with their feet, or whole heads, or
    only their ears black; but my informant, Admiral Sulivan,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> who long resided on these islands, does
    not believe that they are ever purely white. So that in these two
    archipelagos we see that the cattle tend to become white with
    coloured ears. In other parts of the Falkland Islands other colours
    prevail: near Port Pleasant brown is the common tint; round Mount
    Usborn, about half the animals in some of the herds were lead- or
    mouse-coloured, which elsewhere is an unusual tint. These latter
    cattle, though generally inhabiting high land, breed about a month
    earlier than the other cattle; and this circumstance would aid in
    keeping them distinct and in perpetuating a peculiar colour. It is
    worth recalling to mind that blue or lead-coloured marks have
    occasionally appeared on the white cattle of Chillingham. So
    plainly different were the colours of the wild herds in different
    parts of the Falkland Islands, that in hunting them, as Admiral
    Sulivan informs me, white spots in one district, and dark spots in
    another district, were always looked out for on the distant hills.
    In the intermediate districts, intermediate colours prevailed.
    Whatever the cause may be, this tendency in the wild cattle of the
    Falkland Islands, which are all descended from a few brought from
    La Plata, to break up into herds of three different colours, is an
    interesting fact.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Returning to the several British breeds, the
    conspicuous difference in general appearance between Shorthorns,
    Longhorns (now rarely seen), Herefords, Highland cattle, Alderneys,
    etc., must be familiar to every one. A part of this difference may
    be attributed to descent from primordially distinct species; but we
    may feel sure that there has been a considerable amount of
    variation. Even during the Neolithic period, the domestic cattle
    were to a certain extent variable. Within recent times most of the
    breeds have been modified by careful and methodical selection. How
    strongly the characters thus acquired are inherited, may be
    inferred from the prices realised by the improved breeds; even at
    the first sale of Colling's Shorthorns, eleven bulls reached an
    average of 214 pounds, and lately Shorthorn bulls have been sold
    for a thousand guineas, and have been exported to all quarters of
    the world.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some constitutional differences may be here
    noticed. The Shorthorns arrive at maturity far earlier than the
    wilder breeds, such as those of Wales or the Highlands. This fact
    has been shown in an interesting manner by Mr. Simonds,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> who has given a table of the average
    period of their dentition, which proves that there is a difference
    of no less than six months in the appearance of the permanent
    incisors. The period of gestation, from observations made by
    Tessier on 1131 cows, varies to the extent of eighty-one days; and
    what is more interesting, M. Lefour affirms "that the period of
    gestation is longer in the large German cattle than in the smaller
    breeds."<A href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> With respect to the
    period of conception, it seems certain that Alderney and Zetland
    cows often become pregnant earlier than other breeds.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> Lastly, as four fully developed
    mamm&#230; is a generic character in the genus Bos,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> it is worth notice that with our
    domestic cows the two rudimentary mamm&#230; often become fairly
    well developed and yield milk.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As numerous breeds are generally found only in
    long-civilised countries, it may be well to show that in some
    countries inhabited by barbarous races, who are frequently at war
    with each other, and therefore have little free communication,
    several distinct breeds of cattle now exist or formerly existed. At
    the Cape of Good Hope Leguat observed, in the year 1720, three
    kinds.<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> At the present day various
    travellers have noticed the differences in the breeds in Southern
    Africa. Sir Andrew Smith several years ago remarked to me that the
    cattle possessed by the different tribes of Caffres, though living
    near each other under the same latitude and in the same kind of
    country, yet differed, and he expressed much surprise at the fact.
    Mr. Andersson has described<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> the
    Damara, Bechuana, and Namaqua cattle; and he informs me in a letter
    that the cattle north of Lake Ngami are likewise different, as Mr.
    Galton has heard is also the case with the cattle of Benguela. The
    Namaqua cattle in size and shape nearly resemble European cattle,
    and have short stout horns and large hoofs. The Damara cattle are
    very peculiar, being big-boned, with slender legs, and small hard
    feet; their tails are adorned with a tuft of long bushy hair nearly
    touching the ground, and their horns are extraordinarily large. The
    Bechuana cattle have even larger horns, and there is now a skull in
    London with the two horns 8 ft. 8-1/4 in. long, as measured in a
    straight line from tip to tip, and no less than 13 ft. 5 in. as
    measured along their curvature! Mr. Andersson in his letter to me
    says that, though he will not venture to describe the differences
    between the breeds belonging to the many different sub-tribes, yet
    such certainly exist, as shown by the wonderful facility with which
    the natives discriminate them.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That many breeds of cattle have originated
    through variation, independently of descent from distinct species,
    we may infer from what we see in South America, where the genus Bos
    was not endemic, and where the cattle which now exist in such vast
    numbers are the descendants of a few imported from Spain and
    Portugal. In Columbia, Roulin<A href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
    describes two peculiar breeds, namely, <I>pelones,</I> with
    extremely thin and fine hair, and <I>calongos,</I> absolutely
    naked. According to Castelnau there are two races in Brazil, one
    like European cattle, the other different, with remarkable horns.
    In Paraguay, Azara describes a breed which certainly originated in
    S. America, called <I>chivos,</I> "because they have straight
    vertical horns, conical, and very large at the base." He likewise
    describes a dwarf race in Corrientes, with short legs and a body
    larger than usual. Cattle without horns, and others with reversed
    hair, have also originated in Paraguay.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Another monstrous breed, called niatas or natas,
    of which I saw two small herds on the northern bank of the Plata,
    is so remarkable as to deserve a fuller description. This breed
    bears the same relation to other breeds, as bull or pug dogs do to
    other dogs, or as improved pigs, according to H. von Nathusius, do
    to common pigs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> R&#252;timeyer
    believes that these cattle belong to the primigenius type.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> The forehead is very short and broad,
    with the nasal end of the skull, together with the whole plane of
    the upper molar-teeth, curved upwards. The lower jaw projects
    beyond the upper, and has a corresponding upward curvature. It is
    an interesting fact that an almost similar confirmation
    characterizes, as I am informed by Dr. Falconer, the extinct and
    gigantic Sivatherium of India, and is not known in any other
    ruminant. The upper lip is much drawn back, the nostrils are seated
    high up and are widely open, the eyes project outwards, and the
    horns are large. In walking the head is carried low, and the neck
    is short. The hind legs appear to be longer, compared with the
    front legs, than is usual. The exposed incisor teeth, the short
    head and upturned nostrils, give these cattle the most ludicrous,
    self-confident air of defiance. The skull which I presented to the
    College of Surgeons has been thus described by Professor Owen:<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> "It is remarkable from the stunted
    development of the nasals, premaxillaries, and fore-part of the
    lower jaw, which is unusually curved upwards to come into contact
    with the premaxillaries. The nasal bones are about one-third the
    ordinary length, but retain almost their normal breadth. The
    triangular vacuity is left between them, the frontal and lachrymal,
    which latter bone articulates with the premaxillary, and thus
    excludes the maxillary from any junction with the nasal." So that
    even the connexion of some of the bones is changed. Other
    differences might be added: thus the plane of the condyles is
    somewhat modified, and the terminal edge of the premaxillaries
    forms an arch. In fact, on comparison with the skull of a common
    ox, scarcely a single bone presents the same exact shape, and the
    whole skull has a wonderfully different appearance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The first brief published notice of this race
    was by Azara, between the years 1783-96; but Don F. Muniz, of
    Luxan, who has kindly collected information for me, states that
    about 1760 these cattle were kept as curiosities near Buenos Ayres.
    Their origin is not positively known, but they must have originated
    subsequently to the year 1552, when cattle were first introduced.
    Senor Muniz informs me that the breed is believed to have
    originated with the Indians southward of the Plata. Even to this
    day those reared near the Plata show their less civilised nature in
    being fiercer than common cattle, and in the cow, if visited too
    often, easily deserting her first calf. The breed is very true, and
    a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves. The breed has
    already lasted at least a century. A niata bull crossed with a
    common cow, and the reverse cross, yield offspring having an
    intermediate character, but with the niata character strongly
    displayed. According to Senor Muniz, there is the clearest
    evidence, contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in
    analogous cases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull
    transmits her peculiarities more strongly than does the niata bull
    when crossed with a common cow. When the pasture is tolerably long,
    these cattle feed as well as common cattle with their tongue and
    palate; but during the great droughts, when so many animals perish
    on the Pampas, the niata breed lies under a great disadvantage, and
    would, if not attended to, become extinct; for the common cattle,
    like horses, are able to keep alive by browsing with their lips on
    the twigs of trees and on reeds: this the niatas cannot so well do,
    as their lips do not join, and hence they are found to perish
    before the common cattle. This strikes me as a good illustration of
    how little we are able to judge from the ordinary habits of an
    animal, on what circumstances, occurring only at long intervals of
    time, its rarity or extinction may depend. It shows us, also, how
    natural selection would have determined the rejection of the niata
    modification had it arisen in a state of nature.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Having described the semi-monstrous niata breed,
    I may allude to a white bull, said to have been brought from
    Africa, which was exhibited in London in 1829, and which has been
    well figured by Mr. Harvey.<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> It
    had a hump, and was furnished with a mane. The dewlap was peculiar,
    being divided between its fore-legs into parallel divisions. Its
    lateral hoofs were annually shed, and grew to the length of five or
    six inches. The eye was very peculiar, being remarkably prominent,
    and "resembled a cup and ball, thus enabling the animal to see on
    all sides with equal ease; the pupil was small and oval, or rather
    a parallelogram with the ends cut off, and lying transversely
    across the ball." A new and strange breed might probably have been
    formed by careful breeding and selection from this animal.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have often speculated on the probable causes
    through which each separate district in Great Britain came to
    possess in former times its own peculiar breed of cattle; and the
    question is, perhaps, even more perplexing in the case of Southern
    Africa. We now know that the differences may be in part attributed
    to descent from distinct species; but this cause is far from
    sufficient. Have the slight differences in climate and in the
    nature of the pasture, in the different districts of Britain,
    directly induced corresponding differences in the cattle? We have
    seen that the semi-wild cattle in the several British parks are not
    identical in colouring or size, and that some degree of selection
    has been requisite to keep them true. It is almost certain that
    abundant food given during many generations directly affects the
    size of a breed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> That climate
    directly affects the thickness of the skin and the hair is likewise
    certain: thus Roulin asserts<A href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> that
    the hides of the feral cattle on the hot Llanos "are always much
    less heavy than those of the cattle raised on the high platform of
    Bogota; and that these hides yield in weight and in thickness of
    hair to those of the cattle which have run wild on the lofty
    Paramos." The same difference has been observed in the hides of the
    cattle reared on the bleak Falkland Islands and on the temperate
    Pampas. Low has remarked<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> that the
    cattle which inhabit the more humid parts of Britain have longer
    hair and thicker skins than other British cattle. When we compare
    highly improved stall-fed cattle with the wilder breeds, or compare
    mountain and lowland breeds, we cannot doubt that an active life,
    leading to the free use of the limbs and lungs, affects the shape
    and proportions of the whole body. It is probable that some breeds,
    such as the semi-monstrous niata cattle, and some peculiarities,
    such as being hornless, etc., have appeared suddenly owing to what
    we may call in our ignorance spontaneous variation; but even in
    this case a rude kind of selection is necessary, and the animals
    thus characterised must be at least partially separated from
    others. This degree of care, however, has sometimes been taken even
    in little-civilised districts, where we should least have expected
    it, as in the case of the niata, chivo, and hornless cattle in S.
    America.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That methodical selection has done wonders
    within a recent period in modifying our cattle, no one doubts.
    During the process of methodical selection it has occasionally
    happened that deviations of structure, more strongly pronounced
    than mere individual differences, yet by no means deserving to be
    called monstrosities, have been taken advantage of: thus the famous
    Longhorn Bull, Shakespeare, though of the pure Canley stock,
    "scarcely inherited a single point of the long-horned breed, his
    horns excepted; yet in the hands of Mr. Fowler, this bull greatly
    improved his race. We have also reason to believe that selection,
    carried on so far unconsciously that there was at no one time any
    distinct intention to improve or change the breed, has in the
    course of time modified most of our cattle; for by this process,
    aided by more abundant food, all the lowland British breeds have
    increased greatly in size and in early maturity since the reign of
    Henry VII.<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> It should never be
    forgotten that many animals have to be annually slaughtered; so
    that each owner must determine which shall be killed and which
    preserved for breeding. In every district, as Youatt has remarked,
    there is a prejudice in favour of the native breed; so that animals
    possessing qualities, whatever they may be, which are most valued
    in each district, will be oftenest preserved; and this unmethodical
    selection assuredly will in the long run affect the character of
    the whole breed. But it may be asked, can this rude kind of
    selection have been practised by barbarians such as those of
    southern Africa? In a future chapter on Selection we shall see that
    this has certainly occurred to some extent. Therefore, looking to
    the origin of the many breeds of cattle which formerly inhabited
    the several districts of Britain, I conclude that, although slight
    differences in the nature of the climate, food, etc., as well as
    changed habits of life, aided by correlation of growth, and the
    occasional appearance from unknown causes of considerable
    deviations of structure, have all probably played their parts; yet
    that the occasional preservation in each district of those
    individual animals which were most valued by each owner has perhaps
    been even more effective in the production of the several British
    breeds. As soon as two or more breeds were formed in any district,
    or when new breeds descended from distinct species were introduced,
    their crossing, especially if aided by some selection, will have
    multiplied the number and modified the characters of the older
    breeds.</P>

      <H2>SHEEP.</H2>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I shall treat this subject briefly. Most authors
    look at our domestic sheep as descended from several distinct
    species. Mr. Blyth, who has carefully attended to the subject,
    believes that fourteen wild species now exist, but "that not one of
    them can be identified as the progenitor of any one of the
    interminable domestic races." M. Gervais thinks that there are six
    species of Ovis,<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> but that our
    domestic sheep form a distinct genus, now completely extinct. A
    German naturalist<A href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> believes that
    our sheep descend from ten aboriginally distinct species, of which
    only one is still living in a wild state! Another ingenious
    observer,<A href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> though not a
    naturalist, with a bold defiance of everything known on
    geographical distribution, infers that the sheep of Great Britain
    alone are the descendants of eleven endemic British forms! Under
    such a hopeless state of doubt it would be useless for my purpose
    to give a detailed account of the several breeds; but a few remarks
    may be added.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Sheep have been domesticated from a very ancient
    period. R&#252;timeyer<A href="#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> found in
    the Swiss lake-dwellings the remains of a small breed, with thin
    tall legs, and horns like those of a goat, thus differing somewhat
    from any kind now known. Almost every country has its own peculiar
    breed; and many countries have several breeds differing greatly
    from each other. One of the most strongly marked races is an
    Eastern one with a long tail, including, according to Pallas,
    twenty vertebr&#230;, and so loaded with fat that it is sometimes
    placed on a truck, which is dragged about by the living animal.
    These sheep, though ranked by Fitzinger as a distinct aboriginal
    form, bear in their drooping ears the stamp of long domestication.
    This is likewise the case with those sheep which have two great
    masses of fat on the rump, with the tail in a rudimentary
    condition. The Angola variety of the long-tailed race has curious
    masses of fat on the back of the head and beneath the jaws.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> Mr. Hodgson in an admirable paper<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A> on the sheep of the Himalaya infers
    from the distribution of the several races, "that this caudal
    augmentation in most of its phases is an instance of degeneracy in
    these pre-eminently Alpine animals." The horns present an endless
    diversity in character; being not rarely absent, especially in the
    female sex, or, on the other hand, amounting to four or even eight
    in number. The horns, when numerous, arise from a crest on the
    frontal bone, which is elevated in a peculiar manner. It is
    remarkable that multiplicity of horns "is generally accompanied by
    great length and coarseness of the fleece."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> This correlation, however, is far from
    being general; for instance, I am informed by Mr. D. Forbes, that
    the Spanish sheep in Chile resemble, in fleece and in all other
    characters, their parent merino-race, except that instead of a pair
    they generally bear four horns. The existence of a pair of
    mamm&#230; is a generic character in the genus Ovis as well as in
    several allied forms; nevertheless, as Mr. Hodgson has remarked,
    "this character is not absolutely constant even among the true and
    proper sheep: for I have more than once met with C&#225;gias (a
    sub-Himalayan domestic race) possessed of four teats."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> This case is the more remarkable as,
    when any part or organ is present in reduced number in comparison
    with the same part in allied groups, it usually is subject to
    little variation. The presence of interdigital pits has likewise
    been considered as a generic distinction in sheep; but Isidore
    Geoffroy<A href="#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> has shown that these
    pits or pouches are absent in some breeds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In sheep there is a strong tendency for
    characters, which have apparently been acquired under
    domestication, to become attached either exclusively to the male
    sex, or to be more highly developed in this than in the other sex.
    Thus in many breeds the horns are deficient in the ewe, though this
    likewise occurs occasionally with the female of the wild musmon. In
    the rams of the Wallachian breed, "the horns spring almost
    perpendicularly from the frontal bone, and then take a beautiful
    spiral form; in the ewes they protrude nearly at right angles from
    the head, and then become twisted in a singular manner."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> Mr. Hodgson states that the
    extraordinarily arched nose or chaffron, which is so highly
    developed in several foreign breeds, is characteristic of the ram
    alone, and apparently is the result of domestication.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> I hear from Mr. Blyth that the
    accumulation of fat in the fat-tailed sheep of the plains of India
    is greater in the male than in the female; and Fitzinger<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> remarks that the mane in the African
    maned race is far more developed in the ram than in the ewe.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Different races of sheep, like cattle, present
    constitutional differences. Thus the improved breeds arrive at
    maturity at an early age, as has been well shown by Mr. Simonds
    through their early average period of dentition. The several races
    have become adapted to different kinds of pasture and climate: for
    instance, no one can rear Leicester sheep on mountainous regions,
    where Cheviots flourish. As Youatt has remarked, "In all the
    different districts of Great Britain we find various breeds of
    sheep beautifully adapted to the locality which they occupy. No one
    knows their origin; they are indigenous to the soil, climate,
    pasturage, and the locality on which they graze; they seem to have
    been formed for it and by it."<A href="#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A>
    Marshall relates<A href="#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> that a flock of
    heavy Lincolnshire and light Norfolk sheep which had been bred
    together in a large sheep-walk, part of which was low, rich, and
    moist, and another part high and dry, with benty grass, when turned
    out, regularly separated from each other; the heavy sheep drawing
    off to the rich soil, and the lighter sheep to their own soil; so
    that "whilst there was plenty of grass the two breeds kept
    themselves as distinct as rooks and pigeons." Numerous sheep from
    various parts of the world have been brought during a long course
    of years to the Zoological Gardens of London; but as Youatt, who
    attended the animals as a veterinary surgeon, remarks, "few or none
    die of the rot, but they are phthisical; not one of them from a
    torrid climate lasts out the second year, and when they die their
    lungs are tuberculated."<A href="#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A> There is
    very good evidence that English breeds of sheep will not succeed in
    France.<A href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A> Even in certain parts of
    England it has been found impossible to keep certain breeds of
    sheep; thus on a farm on the banks of the Ouse, the Leicester sheep
    were so rapidly destroyed by pleuritis<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> that the owner could not keep them; the
    coarser-skinned sheep never being affected.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The period of gestation was formerly thought to
    be of so unalterable a character, that a supposed difference of
    this kind between the wolf and the dog was esteemed a sure sign of
    specific distinction; but we have seen that the period is shorter
    in the improved breeds of the pig, and in the larger breeds of the
    ox, than in other breeds of these two animals. And now we know, on
    the excellent authority of Hermann von Nathusius,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>90</SUP></A> that Merino and Southdown sheep, when
    both have long been kept under exactly the same conditions, differ
    in their average period of gestation, as is seen in the following

    animals having different proportions of Southdown blood, we see how
    strictly the two periods of gestation have been transmitted.
    Nathusius remarks that, as Southdowns grow with remarkable rapidity
    after birth, it is not surprising that their foetal development
    should have been shortened. It is of course possible that the
    difference in these two breeds may be due to their descent from
    distinct parent-species; but as the early maturity of the
    Southdowns has long been carefully attended to by breeders, the
    difference is more probably the result of such attention. Lastly,
    the fecundity of the several breeds differs much; some generally
    producing twins or even triplets at a birth, of which fact the
    curious Shangai sheep (with their truncated and rudimentary ears,
    and great Roman noses), lately exhibited in the Zoological Gardens,
    offer a remarkable instance.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Sheep are perhaps more readily affected by the
    direct action of the conditions of life to which they have been
    exposed than almost any other domestic animal. According to Pallas,
    and more recently according to Erman, the fat-tailed Kirghisian
    sheep, when bred for a few generations in Russia, degenerate, and
    the mass of fat dwindles away, "the scanty and bitter herbage of
    the steppes seems so essential to their development." Pallas makes
    an analogous statement with respect to one of the Crimean breeds.
    Burnes states that the Karakool breed, which produces a fine,
    curled, black, and valuable fleece, when removed from its own
    canton near Bokhara to Persia or to other quarters, loses its
    peculiar fleece.<A href="#refer"><SUP>91</SUP></A> In all such
    cases, however, it may be that a change of any kind in the
    conditions of life causes variability and consequent loss of
    character, and not that certain conditions are necessary for the
    development of certain characters.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Great heat, however, seems to act directly on
    the fleece: several accounts have been published of the change
    which sheep imported from Europe undergo in the West Indies. Dr.
    Nicholson of Antigua informs me that, after the third generation,
    the wool disappears from the whole body, except over the loins; and
    the animal then appears like a goat with a dirty door-mat on its
    back. A similar change is said to take place on the west coast of
    Africa.<A href="#refer"><SUP>92</SUP></A> On the other hand, many
    wool-bearing sheep live on the hot plains of India. Roulin asserts
    that in the lower and heated valleys of the Cordillera, if the
    lambs are sheared as soon as the wool has grown to a certain
    thickness, all goes on afterwards as usual; but if not sheared, the
    wool detaches itself in flakes, and short shining hair like that on
    a goat is produced ever afterwards. This curious result seems
    merely to be an exaggerated tendency natural to the Merino breed,
    for as a great authority, namely, Lord Somerville, remarks, "the
    wool of our Merino sheep after shear-time is hard and coarse to
    such a degree as to render it almost impossible to suppose that the
    same animal could bear wool so opposite in quality, compared to
    that which has been clipped from it: as the cold weather advances,
    the fleeces recover their soft quality." As in sheep of all breeds
    the fleece naturally consists of longer and coarser hair covering
    shorter and softer wool, the change which it often undergoes in hot
    climates is probably merely a case of unequal development; for even
    with those sheep which like goats are covered with hair, a small
    quantity of underlying wool may always be found.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>93</SUP></A> In the wild mountain-sheep (<I>0vis
    montana</I>) of North America there is an analogous annual change
    of coat; "the wool begins to drop out in early spring, leaving in
    its place a coat of hair resembling that of the elk, a change of
    pelage quite different in character from the ordinary thickening of
    the coat or hair, common to all furred animals in winter,&#8212;for
    instance, in the horse, the cow, etc., which shed their winter coat
    in the spring."<A href="#refer"><SUP>94</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A slight difference in climate or pasture
    sometimes slightly affects the fleece, as has been observed even in
    different districts in England, and is well shown by the great
    softness of the wool brought from Southern Australia. But it should
    be observed, as Youatt repeatedly insists, that the tendency to
    change may generally be counteracted by careful selection. M.
    Lasterye, after discussing this subject, sums up as follows: "The
    preservation of the Merino race in its utmost purity at the Cape of
    Good Hope, in the marshes of Holland, and under the rigorous
    climate of Sweden, furnishes an additional support of this my
    unalterable principle, that fine-woolled sheep may be kept wherever
    industrious men and intelligent breeders exist."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">That methodical selection has effected great
    changes in several breeds of sheep no one who knows anything on the
    subject, entertains a doubt. The case of the Southdowns, as
    improved by Ellman, offers perhaps the most striking instance.
    Unconscious or occasional selection has likewise slowly produced a
    great effect, as we shall see in the chapters on Selection. That
    crossing has largely modified some breeds, no one who will study
    what has been written on this subject&#8212;for instance, Mr.
    Spooner's paper&#8212;will dispute; but to produce uniformity in a
    crossed breed, careful selection and "rigorous weeding," as this
    author expresses it, are indispensable.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>95</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In some few instances new breeds have suddenly
    originated; thus, in 1791, a ram-lamb was born in Massachusetts,
    having short crooked legs and a long back, like a turnspit-dog.
    From this one lamb the <I>otter</I> or <I>ancon</I> semi-monstrous
    breed was raised; as these sheep could not leap over the fences, it
    was thought that they would be valuable; but they have been
    supplanted by merinos, and thus exterminated. The sheep are
    remarkable from transmitting their character so truly that Colonel
    Humphreys<A href="#refer"><SUP>96</SUP></A> never heard of "but one
    questionable case" of an ancon ram and ewe not producing ancon
    offspring. When they are crossed with other breeds the offspring,
    with rare exceptions, instead of being intermediate in character,
    perfectly resemble either parent; even one of twins has resembled
    one parent and the second the other. Lastly, "the ancons have been
    observed to keep together, separating themselves from the rest of
    the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A more interesting case has been recorded in the
    Report of the Juries for the Great Exhibition (1851), namely, the
    production of a merino ram-lamb on the Mauchamp farm, in 1828,
    which was remarkable for its long, smooth, straight, and silky
    wool. By the year 1833 M. Graux had raised rams enough to serve his
    whole flock, and after a few more years he was able to sell stock
    of his new breed. So peculiar and valuable is the wool, that it
    sells at 25 per cent above the best merino wool: even the fleeces
    of half-bred animals are valuable, and are known in France as the
    "Mauchamp-merino." It is interesting, as showing how generally any
    marked deviation of structure is accompanied by other deviations,
    that the first ram and his immediate offspring were of small size,
    with large heads, long necks, narrow chests, and long flanks; but
    these blemishes were removed by judicious crosses and selection.
    The long smooth wool was also correlated with smooth horns; and as
    horns and hair are homologous structures, we can understand the
    meaning of this correlation. If the Mauchamp and ancon breeds had
    originated a century or two ago, we should have had no record of
    their birth; and many a naturalist would no doubt have insisted,
    especially in the case of the Mauchamp race, that they had each
    descended from, or been crossed with, some unknown aboriginal
    form.</P>

      <H2>GOATS.</H2>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the recent researches of M. Brandt, most
    naturalists now believe that all our goats are descended from the
    <I>Capra &#230;gagrus</I> of the mountains of Asia, possibly
    mingled with the allied Indian species <I>C. falconeri</I> of
    India.<A href="#refer"><SUP>97</SUP></A> In Switzerland, during the
    neolithic period, the domestic goat was commoner than the sheep;
    and this very ancient race differed in no respect from that now
    common in Switzerland.<A href="#refer"><SUP>98</SUP></A> At the
    present time, the many races found in several parts of the world
    differ greatly from each other; nevertheless, as far as they have
    been tried,<A href="#refer"><SUP>99</SUP></A> they are all quite
    fertile when crossed. So numerous are the breeds, that Mr. G.
    Clark<A href="#refer"><SUP>100</SUP></A> has described eight
    distinct kinds imported into the one island of Mauritius. The ears
    of one kind were enormously developed, being, as measured by Mr.
    Clark, no less than 19 inches in length and 4-3/4 inches in
    breadth. As with cattle, the mamm&#230; of those breeds which are
    regularly milked become greatly developed; and, as Mr. Clark
    remarks, "it is not rare to see their teats touching the ground."
    The following cases are worth notice as presenting unusual points
    of variation. According to Godron,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>101</SUP></A> the mamm&#230; differ greatly in shape
    in different breeds, being elongated in the common goat,
    hemispherical in the Angora race, and bilobed and divergent in the
    goats of Syria and Nubia. According to this same author, the males
    of certain breeds have lost their usual offensive odour. In one of
    the Indian breeds the males and females have horns of
    widely-different shapes;<A href="#refer"><SUP>102</SUP></A> and in
    some breeds the females are destitute of horns.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>103</SUP></A> M. Ramu of Nancy informs me that many
    of the goats there bear on the upper part of the throat a pair of
    hairy appendages, 70 mm. in length and about 10 mm. in diameter,
    which in external appearance resemble those above described on the
    jaws of pigs. The presence of inter-digital pits or glands on all
    four feet has been thought to characterise the genus Ovis, and
    their absence to be characteristic of the genus Capra; but Mr.
    Hodgson has found that they exist in the front feet of the majority
    of Himalayan goats.<A href="#refer"><SUP>104</SUP></A> Mr. Hodgson
    measured the intestines in two goats of the D&#250;g&#250; race,
    and he found that the proportional length of the great and small
    intestines differed considerably. In one of these goats the
    c&#230;cum was thirteen inches, and in the other no less than
    thirty-six inches in length!</P>

      appears in European cattle; but he is mistaken, as we shall
      hereafter see, in supposing that these cattle do not form a
      distinct race. Prof. Wyman, of Cambridge, United States, informs
      me that the common cod-fish presents a similar monstrosity,
      called by the fishermen "bull-dog cod." Prof. Wyman also
      concluded, after making numerous inquiries in La Plata, that the
      niata cattle transmit their peculiarities or form a race.</FONT></LI>
