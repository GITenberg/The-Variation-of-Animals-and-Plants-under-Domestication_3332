    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the two previous chapters, when discussing
    reversion and prepotency, I was necessarily led to give many facts
    on crossing. In the present chapter I shall consider the part which
    crossing plays in two opposed directions,&#8212;firstly, in
    obliterating characters, and consequently in preventing the
    formation of new races; and secondly, in the modification of old
    races, or in the formation of new and intermediate races, by a
    combination of characters. I shall also show that certain
    characters are incapable of fusion.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The effects of free or uncontrolled breeding
    between the members of the same variety or of closely allied
    varieties are important; but are so obvious that they need not be
    discussed at much length. It is free intercrossing which chiefly
    gives uniformity, both under nature and under domestication, to the
    individuals of the same species or variety, when they live mingled
    together and are not exposed to any cause inducing excessive
    variability. The prevention of free crossing, and the intentional
    matching of individual animals, are the corner-stones of the
    breeder's art. No man in his senses would expect to improve or
    modify a breed in any particular manner, or keep an old breed true
    and distinct, unless he separated his animals. The killing of
    inferior animals in each generation comes to the same thing as
    their separation. In savage and semi-civilised countries, where the
    inhabitants have not the means of separating their animals, more
    than a single breed of the same species rarely or never exists. In
    former times, even in the United States, there were no distinct
    races of sheep, for all had been mingled together.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> The celebrated agriculturist Marshall<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> remarks that "sheep that are kept
    within fences, as well as shepherded flocks in open countries, have
    generally a similarity, if not a uniformity, of character in the
    individuals of each flock;" for they breed freely together, and are
    prevented from crossing with other kinds; whereas in the unenclosed
    parts of England the unshepherded sheep, even of the same flock,
    are far from true or uniform, owing to various breeds having
    mingled and crossed. We have seen that the half-wild cattle in each
    of the several British parks are nearly uniform in character; but
    in the different parks, from not having mingled and crossed during
    many generations, they differ to a certain small extent.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We cannot doubt that the extraordinary number of
    varieties and sub-varieties of the pigeon, amounting to at least
    one hundred and fifty, is partly due to their remaining,
    differently from other domesticated birds, paired for life once
    matched. On the other hand, breeds of cats imported into this
    country soon disappear, for their nocturnal and rambling habits
    render it hardly possible to prevent free crossing. Rengger<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> gives an interesting case with respect to
    the cat in Paraguay: in all the distant parts of the kingdom it has
    assumed, apparently from the effects of the climate, a peculiar
    character, but near the capital this change has been prevented,
    owing, as he asserts, to the native animal frequently crossing with
    cats imported from Europe. In all cases like the foregoing, the
    effects of an occasional cross will be augmented by the increased
    vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring, of which fact
    evidence will hereafter be given; for this will lead to the
    mongrels increasing more rapidly than the pure parent-breeds.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When distinct breeds are allowed to cross
    freely, the result will be a heterogeneous body; for instance, the
    dogs in Paraguay are far from uniform, and can no longer be
    affiliated to their parent-races.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
    The character which a crossed body of animals will ultimately
    assume must depend on several contingencies,&#8212;namely, on the
    relative members of the individuals belonging to the two or more
    races which are allowed to mingle; on the prepotency of one race
    over the other in the transmission of character; and on the
    conditions of life to which they are exposed. When two commingled
    breeds exist at first in nearly equal numbers, the whole will
    sooner or later become intimately blended, but not so soon, both
    breeds being equally favoured in all respects, as might have been
    expected. The following calculation<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> shows that this is the case: if a colony
    with an equal number of black and white men were founded, and we
    assume that they marry indiscriminately, are equally prolific, and
    that one in thirty annually dies and is born; then "in 65 years the
    number of blacks, whites, and mulattoes would be equal. In 91 years
    the whites would be 1-10th, the blacks 1-10th, and the mulattoes,
    or people of intermediate degrees of colour, 8-10ths of the whole
    number. In three centuries not 1-100th part of the whites would
    exist."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">When one of two mingled races exceed the other
    greatly in number, the latter will soon be wholly, or almost
    wholly, absorbed and lost.<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Thus
    European pigs and dogs have been largely introduced in the islands
    of the Pacific Ocean, and the native races have been absorbed and
    lost in the course of about fifty or sixty years;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> but the imported races no doubt were
    favoured. Rats may be considered as semi-domesticated animals. Some
    snake-rats (<I>Mus alexandrinus</I>) escaped in the Zoological
    Gardens of London "and for a long time afterwards the keepers
    frequently caught cross-bred rats, at first half-breds, afterwards
    with less of the character of the snake-rat, till at length all
    traces of it disappeared."<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> On the
    other hand, in some parts of London, especially near the docks,
    where fresh rats are frequently imported, an endless variety of
    intermediate forms may be found between the brown, black, and snake
    rat, which are all three usually ranked as distinct species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">How many generations are necessary for one
    species or race to absorb another by repeated crosses has often
    been discussed;<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and the requisite
    number has probably been much exaggerated. Some writers have
    maintained that a dozen or score, or even more generations, are
    necessary; but this in itself is improbable, for in the tenth
    generation there would be only 1-1024th part of foreign blood in
    the offspring. G&#228;rtner found,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> that with plants, one species could be
    made to absorb another in from three to five generations, and he
    believes that this could always be effected in from six to seven
    generations. In one instance, however, Kolreuter<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> speaks of the offspring of <I>Mirabilis
    vulgaris,</I> crossed during eight successive generations by <I>M.
    longiflora,</I> as resembling this latter species so closely, that
    the most scrupulous observer could detect "vix aliquam notabilem
    differentiam" or, as he says, he succeeded, "ad plenariam fere
    transmutationem." But this expression shows that the act of
    absorption was not even then absolutely complete, though these
    crossed plants contained only the 1-256th part of <I>M.
    vulgaris.</I> The conclusions of such accurate observers as
    G&#228;rtner and K&#246;lreuter are of far higher worth than those
    made without scientific aim by breeders. The most precise account
    which I have met with is given by Stonehenge<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> and is illustrated by photographs. Mr.
    Hanley crossed a greyhound bitch with a bulldog; the offspring in
    each succeeding generation being recrossed with first-rate
    greyhounds. As Stonehenge remarks, it might naturally be supposed
    that it would take several crosses to get rid of the heavy form of
    the bulldog; but Hysterics, the gr-gr-granddaughter of a bulldog,
    showed no trace whatever of this breed in external form. She and
    all of the same litter, however, were "remarkably deficient in
    stoutness, though fast as well as clever." I believe clever refers
    to skill in turning. Hysterics was put to a son of Bedlamite, "but
    the result of the fifth cross is not as yet, I believe, more
    satisfactory than that of the fourth." On the other hand, with
    sheep, Fleischmann<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> shows how
    persistent the effects of a single cross may be: he says "that the
    original coarse sheep (of Germany) have 5500 fibres of wool on a
    square inch; grades of the third or fourth Merino cross produced
    about 8000, the twentieth cross 27,000, the perfect pure Merino
    blood 40,000 to 48,000." So that common German sheep crossed twenty
    times successively with Merino did not by any means acquire wool as
    fine as that of the pure breed. But in all cases, the rate of
    absorption will depend largely on the conditions of life being
    favourable to any particular character; and we may suspect that
    there would be a constant tendency to degeneration in the wool of
    Merinos under the climate of Germany, unless prevented by careful
    selection; and thus perhaps the foregoing remarkable case may be
    explained. The rate of absorption must also depend on the amount of
    distinguishable difference between the two forms which are crossed,
    and especially, as G&#228;rtner insists, on prepotency of
    transmission in the one form over the other. We have seen in the
    last chapter that one of two French breeds of sheep yielded up its
    character, when crossed with Merinos, very much more slowly than
    the other; and the common German sheep referred to by Fleischmann
    may be in this respect analogous. In all cases there will be more
    or less liability to reversion during many subsequent generations,
    and it is this fact which has probably led authors to maintain that
    a score or more of generations are requisite for one race to absorb
    another. In considering the final result of the commingling of two
    or more breeds, we must not forget that the act of crossing in
    itself tends to bring back long-lost characters not proper to the
    immediate parent-forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to the influence of the conditions
    of life on any two breeds which are allowed to cross freely, unless
    both are indigenous and have long been accustomed to the country
    where they live, they will, in all probability, be unequally
    affected by the conditions, and this will modify the result. Even
    with indigenous breeds, it will rarely or never occur that both are
    equally well adapted to the surrounding circumstances; more
    especially when permitted to roam freely, and not carefully tended,
    as is generally the case with breeds allowed to cross. As a
    consequence of this, natural selection will to a certain extent
    come into action, and the best fitted will survive, and this will
    aid in determining the ultimate character of the commingled
    body.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">How long a time it would require before such a
    crossed body of animals would assume a uniform character within a
    limited area, no one can say; that they would ultimately become
    uniform from free intercrossing, and from the survival of the
    fittest, we may feel assured; but the characters thus acquired
    would rarely or never, as may be inferred from the previous
    considerations, be exactly intermediate between those of the two
    parent-breeds. With respect to the very slight differences by which
    the individuals of the same sub-variety, or even of allied
    varieties, are characterised, it is obvious that free crossing
    would soon obliterate such small distinctions. The formation of new
    varieties, independently of selection, would also thus be
    prevented; except when the same variation continually recurred from
    the action of some strongly predisposing cause. We may therefore
    conclude that free crossing has in all cases played an important
    part in giving uniformity of character to all the members of the
    same domestic race and of the same natural species, though largely
    governed by natural selection and by the direct action of the
    surrounding conditions.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the possibility of all organic beings
    occasionally intercrossing.</I>&#8212;But it may be asked, can free
    crossing occur with hermaphrodite animals and plants? All the
    higher animals, and the few insects which have been domesticated,
    have separate sexes, and must inevitably unite for each birth. With
    respect to the crossing of hermaphrodites, the subject is too large
    for the present volume, but in the 'Origin of Species' I have given
    a short abstract of the reasons which induce me to believe that all
    organic beings occasionally cross, though perhaps in some cases
    only at long intervals of time.<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> I
    will merely recall the fact that many plants, though hermaphrodite
    in structure, are unisexual in function;&#8212;such as those called
    by C.K. Sprengel <I>dichogamous,</I> in which the pollen and stigma
    of the same flower are matured at different periods; or those
    called by me <I>reciprocally dimorphic,</I> in which the flower's
    own pollen is not fitted to fertilise its own stigma; or again, the
    many kinds in which curious mechanical contrivances exist,
    effectually preventing self-fertilisation. There are, however, many
    hermaphrodite plants which are not in any way specially constructed
    to favour intercrossing, but which nevertheless commingle almost as
    freely as animals with separated sexes. This is the case with
    cabbages, radishes, and onions, as I know from having experimented
    on them: even the peasants of Liguria say that cabbages must be
    prevented "from falling in love" with each other. In the orange
    tribe, Gallesio<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> remarks that the
    amelioration of the various kinds is checked by their continual and
    almost regular crossing. So it is with numerous other plants.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, some cultivated plants rarely
    or never intercross, for instance, the common pea and sweet-pea
    (<I>Lathyrus odoratus</I>); yet their flowers are certainly adapted
    for cross fertilisation. The varieties of the tomato and aubergine
    (<I>Solanum</I>) and the pimenta (<I>Pimenta vulgaris?</I>) are
    said<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> never to cross, even when
    growing alongside one another. But it should be observed that these
    are all exotic plants, and we do not know how they would behave in
    their native country when visited by the proper insects. With
    respect to the common pea, I have ascertained that it is rarely
    crossed in this country owing to premature fertilisation. There
    exist, however, some plants which under their natural conditions
    appear to be always self-fertilised, such as the Bee Ophrys
    (<I>Ophrys apifera</I>) and a few other Orchids; yet these plants
    exhibit the plainest adaptations for cross-fertilisation. Again,
    some few plants are believed to produce only closed flowers, called
    cleistogene, which cannot possibly be crossed. This was long
    thought to be the case with the <I>Leersia oryzoides,</I><A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> but this grass is now known occasionally
    to produce perfect flowers, which set seed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although some plants, both indigenous and
    naturalised, rarely or never produce flowers, or if they flower
    never produce seeds, yet no one doubts that phanerogamic plants are
    adapted to produce flowers, and the flowers to produce seed. When
    they fail, we believe that such plants under different conditions
    would perform their proper function, or that they formerly did so,
    and will do so again. On analogous grounds, I believe that the
    flowers in the above specified anomalous cases which do not now
    intercross, either would do so occasionally under different
    conditions, or that they formerly did so&#8212;the means for
    affecting this being generally still retained&#8212;and will again
    intercross at some future period, unless indeed they become
    extinct. On this view alone, many points in the structure and
    action of the reproductive organs in hermaphrodite plants and
    animals are intelligible,&#8212;for instance, the fact of the male
    and female organs never being so completely enclosed as to render
    access from without impossible. Hence we may conclude that the most
    important of all the means for giving uniformity to the individuals
    of the same species, namely, the capacity of occasionally
    intercrossing, is present, or has been formerly present, with all
    organic beings, except, perhaps, some of the lowest.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>On certain Characters not
    blending.</I>&#8212;When two breeds are crossed their characters
    usually become intimately fused together; but some characters
    refuse to blend, and are transmitted in an unmodified state either
    from both parents or from one. When grey and white mice are paired,
    the young are piebald, or pure white or grey, but not of an
    intermediate tint; so it is when white and common collared
    turtle-doves are paired. In breeding Game fowls, a great authority,
    Mr. J. Douglas, remarks, "I may here state a strange fact: if you
    cross a black with a white game, you get birds of both breeds of
    the clearest colour." Sir R. Heron crossed during many years white,
    black, brown, and fawn-coloured Angora rabbits, and never once got
    these colours mingled in the same animal, but often all four
    colours in the same litter.<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> From
    cases like these, in which the colours of the two parents are
    transmitted quite separately to the offspring, we have all sorts of
    gradations, leading to complete fusion. I will give an instance: a
    gentleman with a fair complexion, light hair but dark eyes, married
    a lady with dark hair and complexion: their three children have
    very light hair, but on careful search about a dozen black hairs
    were found scattered in the midst of the light hair on the heads of
    all three.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>When turnspit dogs and ancon sheep, both
    of which have dwarfed limbs, are crossed with common breeds, the
    offspring are not intermediate in structure, but take after either
    parent. When tailless or hornless animals are crossed with perfect
    animals, it frequently, but by no means invariably, happens that
    the offspring are either furnished with these organs in a perfect
    state, or are quite destitute of them. According to Rengger, the
    hairless condition of the Paraguay dog is either perfectly or not
    at all transmitted to its mongrel offspring; but I have seen one
    partial exception in a dog of this parentage which had part of its
    skin hairy, and part naked, the parts being distinctly separated as
    in a piebald animal. When Dorking fowls with five toes are crossed
    with other breeds, the chickens often have five toes on one foot
    and four on the other. Some crossed pigs raised by Sir R. Heron
    between the solid-hoofed and common pig had not all four feet in an
    intermediate condition, but two feet were furnished with properly
    divided, and two with united hoofs.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Analogous facts have been observed with
    plants: Major Trevor Clarke crossed the little, glabrous-leaved,
    annual stock (Matthiola), with pollen of a large, red-flowered,
    rough-leaved, biennial stock, called <I>cocardeau</I> by the
    French, and the result was that half the seedlings had glabrous and
    the other half rough leaves, but none had leaves in an intermediate
    state. That the glabrous seedlings were the product of the
    rough-leaved variety, and not accidentally of the mother-plant's
    own pollen, was shown by their tall and strong habit of growth.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> in the succeeding generations
    raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings, some glabrous
    plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character, though
    incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was all
    the time latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants
    formerly referred to, which I raised from reciprocal crosses
    between the peloric and common Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel
    case; for in the first generation all the plants resembled the
    common form, and in the next generation, out of one hundred and
    thirty-seven plants, two alone were in an intermediate condition,
    the others perfectly resembling either the peloric or common form.
    Major Trevor Clarke also fertilised the above-mentioned
    red-flowered stock with pollen from the purple Queen stock, and
    about half the seedlings scarcely differed in habit, and not at all
    in the red colour of the flower, from the mother-plant, the other
    half bearing blossoms of a rich purple, closely like those of the
    paternal plant. G&#228;rtner crossed many white and yellow-flowered
    species and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours were never
    blended, but the offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow
    blossoms; the former in the larger proportion.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> Dr. Herbert raised many seedlings, as he
    informed me, from Swedish turnips crossed by two other varieties,
    and these never produced flowers of an intermediate tint, but
    always like one of their parents. I fertilised the purple sweet-pea
    (<I>Lathyrus odoratus</I>), which has a dark reddish-purple
    standard-petal and violet-coloured wings and keel, with pollen of
    the painted lady sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured
    standard, and almost white wings and keel; and from the same pod I
    twice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts; the greater
    number resembling the father. So perfect was the resemblance, that
    I should have thought there had been some mistake, if the plants
    which were at first identical with the paternal variety, namely,
    the painted-lady, had not later in the season produced, as
    mentioned in a former chapter, flowers blotched and streaked with
    dark purple. I raised grandchildren and great-grandchildren from
    these crossed plants, and they continued to resemble the
    painted-lady, but during later generations became rather more
    blotched with purple, yet none reverted completely to the original
    mother-plant, the purple sweet-pea. The following case is slightly
    different, but still shows the same principle: Naudin<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> raised numerous hybrids between the
    yellow <I>Linaria vulgaris</I> and the purple <I>L. purpurea,</I>
    and during three successive generations the colours kept distinct
    in different parts of the same flower.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>From cases such as the foregoing, in
    which the offspring of the first generation perfectly resemble
    either parent, we come by a small step to those cases in which
    differently coloured flowers borne on the same root resemble both
    parents, and by another step to those in which the same flower or
    fruit is striped or blotched with the two parental colours, or
    bears a single stripe of the colour or other characteristic quality
    of one of the parent-forms. With hybrids and mongrels it frequently
    or even generally happens that one part of the body resembles more
    or less closely one parent and another part the other parent; and
    here again some resistence to fusion, or, what comes to the same
    thing, some mutual affinity between the organic atoms of the same
    nature, apparently comes into play, for otherwise all parts of the
    body would be equally intermediate in character. So again, when the
    offspring of hybrids or mongrels, which are themselves nearly
    intermediate in character, revert either wholly or by segments to
    their ancestors, the principle of the affinity of similar, or the
    repulsion of dissimilar atoms, must come into action. To this
    principle, which seems to be extremely general, we shall recur in
    the chapter on pangenesis.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is remarkable, as has been strongly
    insisted upon by Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire in regard to animals,
    that the transmission of characters without fusion occurs very
    rarely when species are crossed; I know of one exception alone,
    namely, with the hybrids naturally produced between the common and
    hooded crow (<I>Corvus corone</I> and <I>cornix</I>), which,
    however, are closely allied species, differing in nothing except
    colour. Nor have I met with any well-ascertained cases of
    transmission of this kind, even when one form is strongly prepotent
    over another, when two races are crossed which have been slowly
    formed by man's selection, and therefore resemble to a certain
    extent natural species. Such cases as puppies in the same litter
    closely resembling two distinct breeds, are probably due to
    superfoetation,&#8212;that is, to the influence of two fathers. All
    the characters above enumerated, which are transmitted in a perfect
    state to some of the offspring and not to others,&#8212; such as
    distinct colours, nakedness of skin, smoothness of leaves, absence
    of horns or tail, additional toes, pelorism, dwarfed structure,
    etc.,&#8212;have all been known to appear suddenly in individual
    animals and plants. From this fact, and from the several slight,
    aggregated differences which distinguish domestic races and species
    from one another, not being liable to this peculiar form of
    transmission, we may conclude that it is in some way connected with
    the sudden appearance of the characters in question.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>On the Modification of old Races and the
    Formation of new Races by Crossing.</I>&#8212;We have hitherto
    chiefly considered the effects of crossing in giving uniformity of
    character; we must now look to an opposite result. There can be no
    doubt that crossing, with the aid of rigorous selection during
    several generations, has been a potent means in modifying old
    races, and in forming new ones. Lord Orford crossed his famous stud
    of greyhounds once with the bulldog, in order to give them courage
    and perseverance. Certain pointers have been crossed, as I hear
    from the Rev. W. D. Fox, with the foxhound, to give them dash and
    speed. Certain strains of Dorking fowls have had a slight infusion
    of Game blood; and I have known a great fancier who on a single
    occasion crossed his turbit-pigeons with barbs, for the sake of
    gaining greater breadth of beak.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">In the foregoing cases breeds have been crossed
    once, for the sake of modifying some particular character; but with
    most of the improved races of the pig, which now breed true, there
    have been repeated crosses,&#8212;for instance, the improved Essex
    owes its excellence to repeated crosses with the Neapolitan,
    together probably with some infusion of Chinese blood.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> So with our British sheep: almost all
    the races, except the Southdown, have been largely crossed; "this,
    in fact, has been the history of our principal breeds."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> To give an example, the "Oxfordshire
    Downs" now rank as an established breed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> They were produced about the year 1830
    by crossing "Hampshire and in some instances Southdown ewes with
    Cotswold rams:" now the Hampshire ram was itself produced by
    repeated crosses between the native Hampshire sheep and Southdowns;
    and the long-woolled Cotswold were improved by crosses with the
    Leicester, which latter again is believed to have been a cross
    between several long-woolled sheep. Mr. Spooner, after considering
    the various cases which have been carefully recorded, concludes,
    "that from a judicious pairing of cross-bred animals it is
    practicable to establish a new breed." On the continent the history
    of several crossed races of cattle and of other animals has been
    well ascertained. To give one instance: the King of Wurtemburg,
    after twenty-five years' careful breeding, that is, after six or
    seven generations, made a new breed of cattle from a cross between
    a Dutch and a Swiss breed, combined with other breeds.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> The Sebright bantam, which breeds as
    true as any other kind of fowl, was formed about sixty years ago by
    a complicated cross.<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> Dark
    Brahmas, which are believed by some fanciers to constitute a
    distinct species, were undoubtedly formed<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> in the United States, within a recent
    period, by a cross between Chittagongs and Cochins. With plants
    there is little doubt that the Swede-turnip originated from a
    cross; and the history of a variety of wheat, raised from two very
    distinct varieties, and which after six years' culture presented an
    even sample, has been recorded on good authority.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Until lately, cautious and experienced breeders,
    though not averse to a single infusion of foreign blood, were
    almost universally convinced that the attempt to establish a new
    race, intermediate between two widely distinct races, was hopeless
    "they clung with superstitious tenacity to the doctrine of purity
    of blood, believing it to be the ark in which alone true safety
    could be found."<A href="#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> Nor was this
    conviction unreasonable: when two distinct races are crossed, the
    offspring of the first generation are generally nearly uniform in
    character; but even this sometimes fails to be the case, especially
    with crossed dogs and fowls, the young of which from the first are
    sometimes much diversified. As cross-bred animals are generally of
    large size and vigorous, they have been raised in great numbers for
    immediate consumption. But for breeding they are found utterly
    useless; for though they may themselves be uniform in character,
    they yield during many generations astonishingly diversified
    offspring. The breeder is driven to despair, and concludes that he
    will never form an intermediate race. But from the cases already
    given, and from others which have been recorded, it appears that
    patience alone is necessary; as Mr. Spooner remarks, "nature
    opposes no barrier to successful admixture; in the course of time,
    by the aid of selection and careful weeding, it is practicable to
    establish a new breed." After six or seven generations the
    hoped-for result will in most cases be obtained; but even then an
    occasional reversion, or failure to keep true, may be expected. The
    attempt, however, will assuredly fail if the conditions of life be
    decidedly unfavourable to the characters of either parent-breed.<A
    href="#refer"></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although the grandchildren and succeeding
    generations of cross-bred animals are generally variable in an
    extreme degree, some curious exceptions to the rule have been
    observed both with crossed races and species. Thus Boitard and
    Corbi&#233;<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> assert that from a
    Pouter and a Runt "a Cavalier will appear, which we have classed
    amongst pigeons of pure race, because it transmits all its
    qualities to its posterity." The editor of the 'Poultry
    Chronicle'<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> bred some bluish fowls
    from a black Spanish cock and a Malay hen; and these remained true
    to colour "generation after generation." The Himalayan breed of
    rabbits was certainly formed by crossing two sub-varieties of the
    silver-grey rabbit; although it suddenly assumed its present
    character, which differs much from that of either parent-breed, yet
    it has ever since been easily and truly propagated. I crossed some
    Labrador and Penguin ducks, and recrossed the mongrels with
    Penguins; afterwards most of the ducks reared during three
    generations were nearly uniform in character, being brown with a
    white crescentic mark on the lower part of the breast, and with
    some white spots at the base of the beak; so that by the aid of a
    little selection a new breed might easily have been formed. With
    regard to crossed varieties of plants, Mr. Beaton<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> remarks that "Melville's extraordinary
    cross between the Scotch kale and an early cabbage is as true and
    genuine as any on record;" but in this case no doubt selection was
    practised. G&#228;rtner<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> has given
    five cases of hybrids, in which the progeny kept constant; and
    hybrids between <I>Dianthus armeria</I> and <I>deltoides</I>
    remained true and uniform to the tenth generation. Dr. Herbert
    likewise showed me a hybrid from two species of Loasa which from
    its first production had kept constant during several
    generations.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have seen in the first chapter, that the
    several kinds of dogs are almost certainly descended from more than
    one species, and so it is with cattle, pigs and some other
    domesticated animals. Hence the crossing of aboriginally distinct
    species probably came into play at an early period in the formation
    of our present races. From Rutimeyer's observations there can be
    little doubt that this occurred with cattle; but in most cases one
    form will probably have absorbed and obliterated the other, for it
    is not likely that semi-civilised men would have taken the
    necessary pains to modify by selection their commingled, crossed,
    and fluctuating stock. Nevertheless, those animals which were best
    adapted to their conditions of life would have survived through
    natural selection; and by this means crossing will often have
    indirectly aided in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds.
    Within recent times, as far as animals are concerned, the crossing
    of distinct species has done little or nothing towards the
    formation or modification of our races. It is not yet known whether
    the several species of silk-moth which have been recently crossed
    in France will yield permanent races. With plants which can be
    multiplied by buds and cuttings, hybridisation has done wonders, as
    with many kinds of Roses, Rhododendrons, Pelargoniums,
    Calceolarias, and Petunias. Nearly all these plants can be
    propagated by seed, most of them freely; but extremely few or none
    come true by seed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Some authors believe that crossing is the chief
    cause of variability,&#8212;that is, of the appearance of
    absolutely new characters. Some have gone so far as to look at it
    as the sole cause; but this conclusion is disproved by the facts
    given in the chapter on Bud-variation. The belief that characters
    not present in either parent or in their ancestors frequently
    originate from crossing is doubtful; that they occasionally do so
    is probable; but this subject will be more conveniently discussed
    in a future chapter on the causes of Variability.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">A condensed summary of this and of the three
    following chapters, together with some remarks on Hybridism, will
    be given in the nineteenth chapter.</P>
