    <P align="JUSTIFY">I will, as in previous cases, first briefly
    describe the chief domestic breeds of the duck:&#8212;</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>BREED 1. <I>Common Domestic
    Duck.</I>&#8212;Varies much in colour and in proportions, and
    differs in instincts and disposition from the wild duck. There are
    several sub-breeds:&#8212;(1) The Aylesbury, of great size, white,
    with pale-yellow beak and legs; abdominal dermal sack largely
    developed. (2) The Rouen, of great size, coloured like the wild
    duck, with green or mottled beak; dermal sack largely developed.
    (3) Tufted Duck, with a large top-knot of fine downy feathers,
    supported on a fleshy mass, with the skull perforated beneath. The
    top-knot in a duck which I imported from Holland was two and a half
    inches in diameter. (4) Labrador (or Canadian, or Buenos Ayres, or
    East Indian); plumage entirely black; beak broader, relatively to
    its length, than in the wild duck; eggs slightly tinted with black.
    This sub-breed perhaps ought to be ranked as a breed; it includes
    two sub-varieties, one as large as the common domestic duck, which
    I have kept alive, and the other smaller and often capable of
    flight.<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> I presume it is this
    latter sub-variety which has been described in France<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> as flying well, being rather wild, and
    when cooked having the flavour of the wild duck; nevertheless this
    sub-variety is polygamous, like other domesticated ducks and unlike
    the wild duck. These black Labrador ducks breed true; but a case is
    given by Dr. Turral of the French sub-variety producing young with
    some white feathers on the head and neck, and with an
    ochre-coloured patch on the breast.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>BREED 2. <I>Hook-billed
    Duck.</I>&#8212;This bird presents an extraordinary appearance from
    the downward curvature of the beak. The head is often tufted. The
    common colour is white, but some are coloured like wild ducks. It
    is an ancient breed, having been noticed in 1676.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A> It shows its prolonged domestication by
    almost incessantly laying eggs, like the fowls which are called
    everlasting layers.<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>BREED 3. <I>Call
    Duck.</I>&#8212;Remarkable from its small size, and from the
    extraordinary loquacity of the female. Beak short. These birds are
    either white, or coloured like the wild duck.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>BREED 4. <I>Penguin Duck.</I>&#8212;This
    is the most remarkable of all the breeds, and seems to have
    originated in the Malayan archipelago. It walks with its body
    extremely erect, and with its thin neck stretched straight upwards.
    Beak rather short. Tail upturned, including only 18 feathers. Femur
    and metatarsus elongated.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Almost all naturalists admit that the several
    breeds are descended from the common wild duck (<I>Anas
    boschas</I>); most fanciers, on the other hand, take as usual a
    very different view.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> Unless we
    deny that domestication, prolonged during centuries, can affect
    even such unimportant characters as colour, size, and in a slight
    degree proportional dimensions and mental disposition, there is no
    reason whatever to doubt that the domestic duck is descended from
    the common wild species, for the one differs from the other in no
    important character. We have some historical evidence with respect
    to the period and progress of the domestication of the duck. It was
    unknown<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> to the ancient Egyptians,
    to the Jews of the Old Testament, and to the Greeks of the Homeric
    period. About eighteen centuries ago Columella<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> and Varro speak of the necessity of
    keeping ducks in netted enclosures like other wild fowl, so that at
    this period there was danger of their flying away. Moreover, the
    plan recommended by Columella to those who wish to increase their
    stock of ducks, namely, to collect the eggs of the wild bird and to
    place them under a hen, shows, as Mr. Dixon remarks, "that the duck
    had not at this time become a naturalised and prolific inmate of
    the Roman poultry-yard." The origin of the domestic duck from the
    wild species is recognised in nearly every language of Europe, as
    Aldrovandi long ago remarked, by the same name being applied to
    both. The wild duck has a wide range from the Himalayas to North
    America. It crosses readily with the domestic bird, and the crossed
    offspring are perfectly fertile.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Both in North America and Europe the wild duck
    has been found easy to tame and breed. In Sweden this experiment
    was carefully tried by Tiburtius; he succeeded in rearing wild
    ducks for three generations, but, though they were treated like
    common ducks, they did not vary even in a single feather. The young
    birds suffered from being allowed to swim about in cold water,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> as is known to be the case, though
    the fact is a strange one, with the young of the common domestic
    duck. An accurate and well-known observer in England<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> has described in detail his often
    repeated and successful experiments in domesticating the wild duck.
    Young birds are easily reared from eggs hatched under a bantam; but
    to succeed it is indispensable not to place the eggs of both the
    wild and tame duck under the same hen, for in this case "the young
    wild ducks die off, leaving their more hardy brethren in
    undisturbed possession of their foster-mother's care. The
    difference of habit at the onset in the newly-hatched ducklings
    almost entails such a result to a certainty." The wild ducklings
    were from the first quite tame towards those who took care of them
    as long as they wore the same clothes, and likewise to the dogs and
    cats of the house. They would even snap with their beaks at the
    dogs, and drive them away from any spot which they coveted. But
    they were much alarmed at strange men and dogs. Differently from
    what occurred in Sweden, Mr. Hewitt found that his young birds
    always changed and deteriorated in character in the course of two
    or three generations; notwithstanding that great care was taken to
    prevent their crossing with tame ducks. After the third generation
    his birds lost the elegant carriage of the wild species, and began
    to acquire the gait of the common duck. They increased in size in
    each generation, and their legs became less fine. The white collar
    round the neck of the mallard became broader and less regular, and
    some of the longer primary wing-feathers became more or less white.
    When this occurred, Mr. Hewitt destroyed nearly the whole of his
    stock and procured fresh eggs from wild nests; so that he never
    bred the same family for more than five or six generations. His
    birds continued to pair together, and never became polygamous like
    the common domestic duck. I have given these details, because no
    other case, as far as I know, has been so carefully recorded by a
    competent observer of the progress of change in wild birds reared
    for several generations in a domestic condition.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From these considerations there can hardly be a
    doubt that the wild duck is the parent of the common domestic kind;
    nor need we look to other species for the parentage of the more
    distinct breeds, namely, Penguin, Call, Hook-billed, Tufted, and
    Labrador ducks. I will not repeat the arguments used in the
    previous chapters on the improbability of man having in ancient
    times domesticated several species since become unknown or extinct,
    though ducks are not readily exterminated in the wild
    state;&#8212;on some of the supposed parent-species having had
    abnormal characters in comparison with all the other species of the
    genus, as with Hook-billed and Penguin ducks;&#8212;on all the
    breeds, as far as is known being fertile together;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A>&#8212;on all the breeds having the same
    general disposition, instinct, etc. But one fact bearing on this
    question may be noticed: in the great duck family, one species
    alone, namely, the male of <I>A. boschas,</I> has its four middle
    tail-feathers curled upwardly; now in every one of the above-named
    domestic breeds these curled feathers exist, and on the supposition
    that they are descended from distinct species, we must assume that
    man formerly hit upon species all of which had this now unique
    character. Moreover, sub-varieties of each breed are coloured
    almost exactly like the wild duck, as I have seen with the largest
    and smallest breeds, namely Rouens and Call ducks, and, as Mr.
    Brent states,<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> is the case with
    Hook-billed ducks. This gentleman, as he informs me, crossed a
    white Aylesbury drake and a black Labrador duck, and some of the
    ducklings as they grew up assumed the plumage of the wild duck.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With respect to Penguins, I have not seen many
    specimens, and none were coloured precisely like the wild duck; but
    Sir James Brooke sent me three skins from Lombok and Bali, in the
    Malayan archipelago; the two females were paler and more rufous
    than the wild duck, and the drake differed in having the whole
    under and upper surface (excepting the neck, tail-coverts, tail,
    and wings) silver-grey, finely pencilled with dark lines, closely
    like certain parts of the plumage of the wild mallard. But I found
    this drake to be identical in every feather with a variety of the
    common breed procured from a farm-yard in Kent, and I have
    occasionally elsewhere seen similar specimens. The occurrence of a
    duck bred under so peculiar a climate as that of the Malayan
    archipelago, where the wild species does not exist, with exactly
    the same plumage as may occasionally be seen in our farm-yards, is
    a fact worth notice. Nevertheless the climate of the Malayan
    archipelago apparently tends to cause the duck to vary much, for
    Zollinger,<A href="#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> speaking of the
    Penguin breed, says that in Lombok "there is an unusual and very
    wonderful variety of ducks." One Penguin drake which I kept alive
    differed from those of which the skins were sent me from Lombok, in
    having its breast and back partially coloured with chestnut-brown,
    thus more closely resembling the Mallard.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From these several facts, more especially from
    the drakes of all the breeds having curled tail-feathers, and from
    certain sub-varieties in each breed occasionally resembling in
    general plumage the wild duck, we may conclude with confidence that
    all the breeds are descended from <I>A. boschas.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will now notice some of the
    peculiarities characteristic of the several breeds. The eggs vary
    in colour; some common ducks laying pale-greenish and others quite
    white eggs. The eggs which are first laid during each season by the
    black Labrador duck, are tinted black, as if rubbed with ink. A
    good observer assured me that one year his ducks of this breed laid
    almost perfectly white eggs. Another curious case shows what
    singular variations sometimes occur and are inherited; Mr.
    Hansell<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> relates that he had a
    common duck which always laid eggs with the yolk of a dark-brown
    colour like melted glue; and the young ducks, hatched from these
    eggs, laid the same kind of eggs, so that the breed had to be
    destroyed.</SMALL></P>

    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The Hook-billed duck is highly remarkable
    (see fig. 39, of skull); and its peculiar beak has been inherited
    at least since the year 1676. This structure is evidently analogous
    with that described in the Bagadotten carrier pigeon. Mr. Brent<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> says that, when Hook-billed ducks
    are crossed with common ducks, "many young ones are produced with
    the upper mandible shorter than the lower, which not unfrequently
    causes the death of the bird." With ducks a tuft of feathers on the
    head is by no means a rare occurrence; namely, in the True-tufted
    breed, the Hook-billed, the common farm-yard kind, and in a duck
    having no other peculiarity which was sent to me from the Malayan
    archipelago. The tuft is only so far interesting as it affects the
    skull, which is thus rendered slightly more globular, and is
    perforated by numerous apertures. Call ducks are remarkable from
    their extraordinary loquacity: the drake only hisses like common
    drakes; nevertheless, when paired with the common duck, he
    transmits to his female offspring a strong quacking tendency. This
    loquacity seems at first a surprising character to have been
    acquired under domestication. But the voice varies in the different
    breeds; Mr. Brent<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> says that
    Hook-billed ducks are very loquacious, and that Rouens utter a
    "dull, loud, and monotonous cry, easily distinguishable by an
    experienced ear." As the loquacity of the Call duck is highly
    serviceable, these birds being used in decoys, this quality may
    have been increased by selection. For instance, Colonel Hawker
    says, if young wild ducks cannot be got for a decoy, "by way of
    make-shift, <I>select</I> tame birds which are the most clamorous,
    even if their colour should not be like that of wild ones."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> It has been erroneously asserted that
    Call ducks hatch their eggs in less time than common ducks.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The Penguin duck is the most remarkable
    of all the breeds; the thin neck and body are carried erect; the
    wings are small; the tail is upturned; and the thigh-bones and
    metatarsi are considerably lengthened in proportion with the same
    bones in the wild duck. In five specimens examined by me there were
    only eighteen tail-feathers instead of twenty as in the wild duck;
    but I have also found only eighteen and nineteen tail-feathers in
    two Labrador ducks. On the middle toe, in three specimens, there
    were twenty-seven or twenty-eight scutell&#230;, whereas in two
    wild ducks there were thirty-one and thirty-two. The Penguin when
    crossed transmits with much power its peculiar form of body and
    gait to its offspring; this was manifest with some hybrids raised
    in the Zoological Gardens between one of these birds and the
    Egyptian goose,<A href="#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> (<I>Anser
    &#230;gyptiacus</I>) and likewise with some mongrels which I raised
    between the Penguin and Labrador duck. I am not much surprised that
    some writers should maintain that this breed must be descended from
    an unknown and distinct species; but from the reasons already
    assigned, it seems to me far more probable that it is the
    descendant, much modified by domestication under an unnatural
    climate, of <I>Anas boschas.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Osteological Characters.</I>&#8212;The
    skulls of the several breeds differ from each other and from the
    skull of the wild duck in very little except in the proportional
    length and curvature of the premaxillaries. These latter bones in
    the Call duck are short, and a line drawn from their extremities to
    the summit of the skull is nearly straight, instead of being
    concave as in the common duck; so that the skull resembles that of
    a small goose. In the Hook-billed duck (fig. 39), these same bones
    as well as the lower jaw curve downwards in a most remarkable
    manner, as represented. In the Labrador duck the premaxillaries are
    rather broader than in the wild duck; and in two skulls of this
    breed the vertical ridges on each side of the supra-occipital bone
    are very prominent. In the Penguin the premaxillaries are
    relatively shorter than in the wild duck; and the inferior points
    of the paramastoids more prominent. In a Dutch tufted duck, the
    skull under the enormous tuft was slightly more globular and was
    perforated by two large apertures; in this skull the lachrymal
    bones were produced much further backwards, so as to have a
    different shape and nearly to touch the post. lat. processes of the
    frontal bones, thus almost completing the bony orbit of the eye. As
    the quadrate and pterygoid bones are of such complex shape and
    stand in relation with so many other bones, I carefully compared
    them in all the principal breeds; but excepting in size they
    presented no difference.</SMALL></P>
    <IMG alt="Cervical Verterbr&#230; of Ducks." src="../Images/fig40.jpg"
    width="292" height="368" align="LEFT">

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Vertebr&#230; and Ribs.</I>&#8212;In
    one skeleton of the Labrador duck there were the usual fifteen
    cervical vertebr&#230; and the usual nine dorsal vertebr&#230;
    bearing ribs; in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and
    ten dorsal vertebr&#230; with ribs; nor, as far as could be judged,
    was this owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first
    lumbar vertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebr&#230;
    agreed perfectly in number, shape, and size with those of the wild
    duck. In two skeletons of the Call duck there were fifteen cervical
    and nine dorsal vertebr&#230;; in a third skeleton small ribs were
    attached to the so-called fifteenth cervical vertebra, making ten
    pairs of ribs; but these ten ribs do not correspond, or arise from
    the same vertebra, with the ten in the above-mentioned Labrador
    duck. In the Call duck, which had small ribs attached to the
    fifteenth cervical vertebra, the h&#230;mal spines of the
    thirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth
    (dorsal) vertebr&#230; corresponded with the spines on the
    fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth vertebr&#230; of the wild
    duck: so that each of these vertebr&#230; had acquired a structure
    proper to one posterior to it in position. In the eighth cervical
    vertebra of this same Call duck (fig. 40, B), the two branches of
    the h&#230;mal spine stand much closer together than in the wild
    duck (A), and the descending h&#230;mal processes are much
    shortened. In the Penguin duck the neck from its thinness and
    erectness falsely appears (as ascertained by measurement) to be
    much elongated, but the cervical and dorsal vertebr&#230; present
    no difference; the posterior dorsal vertebr&#230;, however, are
    more completely anchylosed to the pelvis than in the wild duck. The
    Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebr&#230;
    furnished with ribs, but the same number of lumbar, sacral, and
    caudal vertebr&#230;, as far as could be traced, as in the wild
    duck. The cervical vertebr&#230; in this same duck (fig. 40, D)
    were much broader and thicker relatively to their length than in
    the wild (C); so much so, that I have thought it worth while to
    give a sketch of the twelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds.
    From the foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth cervical
    vertebra occasionally becomes modified into a dorsal vertebra, and
    when this occurs all the adjoining vertebr&#230; are modified. We
    also see that an additional dorsal vertebra bearing a rib is
    occasionally developed, the number of the cervical and lumbar
    vertebr&#230; apparently remaining the same as usual.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I examined the bony enlargement of the
    trachea in the males of the Penguin, Call, Hook-billed, Labrador,
    and Aylesbury breeds; and in all it was identical in
    shape.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The <I>pelvis</I> is remarkably uniform;
    but in the skeleton of the Hook-billed duck the anterior part is
    much bowed inwards; in the Aylesbury and some other breeds the
    ischiadic foramen is less elongated. In the sternum, furculum,
    coracoids, and scapul&#230;, the differences are so slight and so
    variable as not to be worth notice, except that in two skeletons of
    the Penguin duck the terminal portion of the scapula was much
    attenuated.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In the bones of the leg and wing no
    modification in shape could be observed. But in the Penguin and
    Hook-billed ducks, the terminal phalanges of the wing are a little
    shortened. In the former, the femur, and metatarsus (but not the
    tibia) are considerably lengthened, relatively to the same bones in
    the wild duck, and to the wing-bones in both birds. This elongation
    of the leg-bones could be seen whilst the bird was alive, and is no
    doubt connected with its peculiar upright manner of walking. In a
    large Aylesbury duck, on the other hand, the tibia was the only
    bone of the leg which relatively to the other bones was slightly
    lengthened.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>On the effects of the increased and
    decreased Use of the Limbs.</I>&#8212;In all the breeds the bones
    of the wing (measured separately after having been cleaned)
    relatively to those of the leg have become slightly shortened, in
    comparison with the same bones in the wild duck, as may be seen in
    Table I.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With respect to Table III, I may first
    state that I tested them by taking another skeleton of a wild duck
    and of a common domestic duck, and by comparing the weight of <I>
    all</I> the bones of the leg with <I>all</I> those of the wings,
    and the result was the same. In the first of these tables we see
    that the leg-bones in each case have increased in actual weight. It
    might have been expected that, with the increased or decreased
    weight of the entire skeleton, the leg-bones would have become
    proportionally heavier or lighter; but their greater weight in all
    the breeds relatively to the other bones can be accounted for only
    by these domestic birds having used their legs in walking and
    standing much more than the wild, for they never fly, and the more
    artificial breeds rarely swim. In the second table we see, with the
    exception of one case, a plain reduction in the weight of the bones
    of the wing, and this no doubt has resulted from their lessened
    use. The one exceptional case, namely, in one of the Call ducks, is
    in truth no exception, for this bird was constantly in the habit of
    flying about; and I have seen it day after day rise from my
    grounds, and fly for a long time in circles of more than a mile in
    diameter. In this Call duck there is not only no decrease, but an
    actual increase in the weight of the wing-bones relatively to those
    of the wild-duck; and this probably is consequent on the remarkable
    lightness and thinness of all the bones of the
    skeleton.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Lastly, I weighed the furculum,
    coracoids, and scapula of a wild duck and of a common domestic
    duck, and I found that their weight, relatively to that of the
    whole skeleton, was as one hundred in the former to eighty-nine in
    the latter; this shows that these bones in the domestic duck have
    been reduced eleven per cent of their due proportional weight. The
    prominence of the crest of the sternum, relatively to its length,
    is also much reduced in all the domestic breeds. These changes have
    evidently been caused by the lessened use of the wings.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is well known that several birds, belonging
    to different Orders, and inhabiting oceanic islands, have their
    wings greatly reduced in size and are incapable of flight. I
    suggested in my 'Origin of Species' that, as these birds are not
    persecuted by any enemies, the reduction of their wings had
    probably been caused by gradual disuse. Hence, during the earlier
    stages of the process of reduction, such birds would probably have
    resembled our domesticated ducks in the state of their organs of
    flight. This is the case with the water-hen (<I>Gallinula
    nesiotis</I>) of Tristan d'Acunha, which "can flutter a little, but
    obviously uses its legs, and not its wings, as a mode of escape."
    Now Mr. Sclater<A href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> finds in this
    bird that the wings, sternum, and coracoids are all reduced in
    length, and the crest of the sternum in depth, in comparison with
    the same bones in the European water-hen (<I>G. chloropus</I>). On
    the other hand, the thigh-bones and pelvis are increased in length,
    the former by four lines, relatively to the same bones in the
    common water-hen. Hence in the skeleton of this natural species
    nearly the same changes have occurred, only carried a little
    further, as with our domestic ducks, and in this latter case I
    presume no one will dispute that they have resulted from the
    lessened use of the wings and the increased use of the legs.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H3>THE GOOSE.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This bird deserves some notice, as hardly any
    other anciently domesticated bird or quadruped has varied so
    little. That geese were anciently domesticated we know from certain
    verses in Homer; and from these birds having been kept (388 <SMALL>
    B.C.</SMALL>) in the Capitol at Rome as sacred to Juno, which
    sacredness implies great antiquity.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> That the goose has varied in some
    degree, we may infer from naturalists not being unanimous with
    respect to its wild parent-form; though the difficulty is chiefly
    due to the existence of three or four closely allied wild European
    species.<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> A large majority of
    capable judges are convinced that our geese are descended from the
    wild Grey-leg goose (<I>A. ferus</I>); the young of which can
    easily be tamed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> This species,
    when crossed with the domestic goose, produced in the Zoological
    Gardens, as I was assured in 1849, perfectly fertile offspring.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> Yarrell<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> has observed that the lower part of the
    trachea of the domestic goose is sometimes flattened, and that a
    ring of white feathers sometimes surrounds the base of the beak.
    These characters seem at first sight good indications of a cross at
    some former period with the white-fronted goose (<I>A.
    albifrons</I>); but the white ring is variable in this latter
    species, and we must not overlook the law of analogous variation;
    that is, of one species assuming some of the characters of allied
    species.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As the goose has proved so little flexible in
    its organisation under long-continued domestication, the amount of
    variation which it has undergone may be worth giving. It has
    increased in size and in productiveness;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> and varies from white to a dusky colour.
    Several observers<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> have stated
    that the gander is more frequently white than the goose, and that
    when old it almost invariably becomes white; but this is not the
    case with the parent-form, the <I>A. ferus.</I> Here, again, the
    law of analogous variation may have come into play, as the almost
    snow-white male of the Rock goose (<I>Bernicla antarctica</I>)
    standing on the sea-shore by his dusky partner is a sight well
    known to those who have traversed the sounds of Tierra del Fuego
    and the Falkland Islands. Some geese have top-knots; and the skull
    beneath, as before stated, is perforated. A sub-breed has lately
    been formed with the feathers reversed at the back of the head and
    neck.<A href="#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> The beak varies a little in
    size, and is of a yellower tint than in the wild species; but its
    colour and that of the legs are both slightly variable.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> This latter fact deserves attention,
    because the colour of the legs and beak is highly serviceable in
    discriminating the several closely allied wild forms.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> At our Shows two breeds are exhibited;
    viz., the Embden and Toulouse; but they differ in nothing except
    colour.<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> Recently a smaller and
    singular variety has been imported from Sebastopol,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> with the scapular feathers (as I hear
    from Mr. Tegetmeier, who sent me specimens) greatly elongated,
    curled, and even spirally twisted. The margins of these feathers
    are rendered plumose by the divergence of the barbs and barbules,
    so that they resemble in some degree those on the back of the black
    Australian swan. These feathers are likewise remarkable from the
    central shaft, which is excessively thin and transparent, being
    split into fine filaments, which, after running for a space free,
    sometimes coalesce again. It is a curious fact that these filaments
    are regularly clothed on each side with fine down or barbules,
    precisely like those on the proper barbs of the feather. This
    structure of the feathers is transmitted to half-bred birds. In <I>
    Gallus sonneratii</I> the barbs and barbules blend together, and
    form thin horny plates of the same nature with the shaft: in this
    variety of the goose, the shaft divides into filaments which
    acquire barbules, and thus resemble true barbs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Although the domestic goose certainly differs
    somewhat from any known wild species, yet the amount of variation
    which it has undergone, as compared with that of most domesticated
    animals, is singularly small. This fact can be partially accounted
    for by selection not having come largely into play. Birds of all
    kinds which present many distinct races are valued as pets or
    ornaments; no one makes a pet of the goose; the name, indeed, in
    more languages than one, is a term of reproach. The goose is valued
    for its size and flavour, for the whiteness of its feathers which
    adds to their value, and for its prolificness and tameness. In all
    these points the goose differs from the wild parent-form; and these
    are the points which have been selected. Even in ancient times the
    Roman gourmands valued the liver of the WHITE goose; and Pierre
    Belon<A href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> in 1555 speaks of two
    varieties, one of which was larger, more fecund, and of a better
    colour than the other; and he expressly states that good managers
    attended to the colour of their goslings, so that they might know
    which to preserve and select for breeding.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H3>THE PEACOCK.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This is another bird which has hardly varied
    under domestication, except in sometimes being white or piebald.
    Mr. Waterhouse carefully compared, as he informs me, skins of the
    wild Indian and domestic bird, and they were identical in every
    respect, except that the plumage of the latter was perhaps rather
    thicker. Whether our birds are descended from those introduced into
    Europe in the time of Alexander, or have been subsequently
    imported, is doubtful. They do not breed very freely with us, and
    are seldom kept in large numbers,&#8212;circumstances which would
    greatly interfere with the gradual selection and formation of new
    breeds. There is one strange fact with respect to the peacock,
    namely, the occasional appearance in England of the "japanned" or
    "black-shouldered" kind. This form has lately been named on the
    high authority of Mr. Sclater as a distinct species, viz. <I>Pavo
    nigripennis,</I> which he believes will hereafter be found wild in
    some country, but not in India, where it is certainly unknown. The
    males of these japanned birds differ conspicuously from the common
    peacock in the colour of their secondary wing-feathers, scapulars,
    wing-coverts, and thighs, and are I think more beautiful; they are
    rather smaller than the common sort, and are always beaten by them
    in their battles, as I hear from the Hon. A. S. G. Canning. The
    females are much paler coloured than those of the common kind. Both
    sexes, as Mr. Canning informs me, are white when they leave the
    egg, and they differ from the young of the white variety only in
    having a peculiar pinkish tinge on their wings. These japanned
    birds, though appearing suddenly in flocks of the common kind,
    propagate their kind quite truly. Although they do not resemble the
    hybrids which have been raised between <I>P. cristatus</I> and <I>
    muticus,</I> nevertheless they are in some respects intermediate in
    character between these two species; and this fact favours, as Mr.
    Sclater believes, the view that they form a distinct and natural
    species.<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, Sir H. Heron states<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> that this breed suddenly appeared within
    his memory in Lord Brownlow's large stock of pied, white, and
    common peacocks. The same thing occurred in Sir J. Trevelyan's
    flock composed entirely of the common kind, and in Mr. Thornton's
    stock of common and pied peacocks. It is remarkable that in these
    two latter instances the black-shouldered kind, though a smaller
    and weaker bird, increased, "to the extinction of the previously
    existing breed." I have also received through Mr. Sclater a
    statement from Mr. Hudson Gurney that he reared many years ago a
    pair of black-shouldered peacocks from the common kind; and another
    ornithologist, Prof. A. Newton, states that, five or six years ago,
    a female bird, in all respects similar to the female of the
    black-shouldered kind, was produced from a stock of common peacocks
    in his possession, which during more than twenty years had not been
    crossed with birds of any other strain. Mr. Jenner Weir informs me
    that a peacock at Blackheath whilst young was white, but as it
    became older gradually assumed the characters of the
    black-shouldered variety; both its parents were common peacocks.
    Lastly, Mr. Canning has given a case of a female of this same
    variety appearing in Ireland in a flock of the ordinary kind.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> Here, then, we have seven well
    authenticated cases in Great Britain of japanned birds, having
    suddenly appeared within recent times in flocks of the common
    peafowl. This variety must also have formerly appeared in Europe,
    for Mr. Canning has seen an old picture, and another is referred to
    in the 'Field,' with this variety represented. These facts seem to
    me to indicate that the japanned peacock is a strongly marked
    variety or "sport," which tends at all times and in many places to
    reappear. This view is supported by the young being at first white
    like the young of the white breed, which is undoubtedly a
    variation. If, on the other hand, we believe the japanned peacock
    to be a distinct species, we must suppose that in all the above
    cases the common breed had at some former period been crossed by
    it, but had lost every trace of the cross; yet that the offspring
    of these birds suddenly and completely reacquired through reversion
    the characters of <I>P. nigripennis.</I> I have heard of no other
    such case in the animal or vegetable kingdom. To perceive the full
    improbability of such an occurrence, we may suppose that a breed of
    dogs had been crossed at some former period with a wolf, but had
    lost every trace of the wolf-like character, yet that the breed
    gave birth in seven instances in the same country, within no great
    length of time, to a wolf perfect in every character; and we must
    further suppose that in two of the cases, the newly produced wolves
    afterwards spontaneously increased to such an extent as to lead to
    the extinction of the parent breed of dogs. So remarkable a bird as
    the <I>P. nigripennis,</I> when first imported, would have realised
    a large price; it is therefore improbable that it should have been
    silently introduced and its history subsequently lost. On the whole
    the evidence seems to me, as it did to Sir R. Heron, to be decisive
    in favour of the japanned or black-shouldered breed being a
    variation, induced by some unknown cause. On this view, the case is
    the most remarkable one ever recorded of the abrupt appearance of a
    new form, which so closely resembles a true species that it has
    deceived one of the most experienced of living ornithologists.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H3>THE TURKEY.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It seems fairly well established by Mr. Gould,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> that the turkey, in accordance with
    the history of its first introduction, is descended from a wild
    Mexican form, which had been domesticated by the natives before the
    discovery of America, and which is now generally ranked as a local
    race, and not as a distinct species. However this may be, the case
    deserves notice because in the United States wild male turkeys
    sometimes court the domestic hens, which are descended from the
    Mexican form, "and are generally received by them with great
    pleasure."<A href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> Several accounts have
    likewise been published of young birds, reared in the United States
    from the eggs of the wild species, crossing and commingling with
    the common breed. In England, also, this same species has been kept
    in several parks; from two of which the Rev. W. D. Fox procured
    birds, and they crossed freely with the common domestic kind, and
    during many years afterwards, as he informs me, the turkeys in his
    neighbourhood clearly showed traces of their crossed parentage. We
    here have an instance of a domestic race being modified by a cross
    with a distinct wild race or species. F. Michaux<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> suspected in 1802 that the common
    domestic turkey was not descended from the United States species
    alone, but likewise from a southern form, and he went so far as to
    believe that English and French turkeys differed from having
    different proportions of the blood of the two parent-forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">English turkeys are smaller than either wild
    form. They have not varied in any great degree; but there are some
    breeds which can be distinguished as Norfolks, Suffolks, Whites,
    and Copper-coloured (or Cambridge), all of which, if precluded from
    crossing with other breeds propagate their kind truly. Of these
    kinds, the most distinct is the small, hardy, dull-black Norfolk
    turkey, of which the chickens are black, occasionally with white
    patches about the head. The other breeds scarcely differ except in
    colour, and their chickens are generally mottled all over with
    brownish-grey.<A href="#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> The inferior
    tail-coverts vary in number, and according to a German superstition
    the hen lays as many eggs as the cock has feathers of this kind.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> Albin in 1738, and Temminck within
    a much later period, describe a beautiful breed, dusky-yellowish,
    brown above and white beneath, with a large top-knot of soft
    plumose feather. The spurs of the male were rudimentary. This breed
    has been for a long time extinct in Europe; but a living specimen
    has lately been imported from the east coast of Africa, which still
    retains the top-knot and the same general colouring and rudimentary
    spurs.<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A> Mr. Wilmot has described<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> a white turkey-cock having a crest
    formed of "feathers about four inches long, with bare quills, and a
    tuft of soft white down growing at the end." Many of the young
    birds inherited this kind of crest, but afterwards it fell off or
    was pecked out by the other birds. This is an interesting case, as
    with care a new breed might probably have been formed; and a
    top-knot of this nature would have been to a certain extent
    analogous to that borne by the males in several allied genera, such
    as Euplocomus, Lophophorus, and Pavo.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Wild turkeys, believed in every instance to have
    been imported from the United States, have been kept in the parks
    of Lords Powis, Leicester, Hill, and Derby. The Rev. W. D. Fox
    procured birds from the two first-named parks, and he informs me
    that they certainly differed a little from each other in the shape
    of their bodies and in the barred plumage on their wings. These
    birds likewise differed from Lord Hill's stock. Some of the latter
    kept at Oulton by Sir P. Egerton, though precluded from crossing
    with common turkeys, occasionally produced much paler-coloured
    birds, and one that was almost white, but not an albino. These
    half-wild turkeys, in thus differing slightly from each other,
    present an analogous case with the wild cattle kept in the several
    British parks. We must suppose that such differences have resulted
    from the prevention of free intercrossing between birds ranging
    over a wide area, and from the changed conditions to which they
    have been exposed in England. In India the climate has apparently
    wrought a still greater change in the turkey, for it is described
    by Mr. Blyth<A href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> as being much
    degenerated in size, "utterly incapable of rising on the wing," of
    a black colour, and "with the long pendulous appendages over the
    beak enormously developed."</P>

      <H3>THE GUINEA FOWL.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The domesticated Guinea fowl is now believed by
    some naturalists to be descended from the <I>Numida
    ptilorhynca,</I> which inhabits very hot, and, in parts, extremely
    arid districts in Eastern Africa; consequently it has been exposed
    in this country to extremely different conditions of life.
    Nevertheless it has hardly varied at all, except in the plumage
    being either paler or darker-coloured. It is a singular fact that
    this bird varies more in colour in the West Indies and on the
    Spanish Main, under a hot though humid climate, than in Europe.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> The Guinea fowl has become
    thoroughly feral in Jamaica and in St. Domingo,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> and has diminished in size; the legs are
    black, whereas the legs of the aboriginal African bird are said to
    be grey. This small change is worth notice on account of the
    often-repeated statement that all feral animals invariably revert
    in every character to their original type.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H3>THE CANARY BIRD.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">As this bird has been recently domesticated,
    namely, within the last 350 years, its variability deserves notice.
    It has been crossed with nine or ten other species of
    Fringillid&#230;, and some of the hybrids are almost completely
    fertile; but we have no evidence that any distinct breed has
    originated from such crosses. Notwithstanding the modern
    domestication of the canary, many varieties have been produced;
    even before the year 1718 a list of twenty-seven varieties was
    published in France,<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> and in 1779
    a long schedule of the desired qualities was printed by the London
    Canary Society, so that methodical selection has been practised
    during a considerable period. The greater number of the varieties
    differ only in colour and in the markings of their plumage. Some
    breeds however, differ in shape, such as the hooped or bowed
    canaries, and the Belgian canaries with their much elongated
    bodies. Mr. Brent<A href="#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> measured one of
    the latter and found it eight inches in length, whilst the wild
    canary is only five and a quarter inches long. There are
    top-knotted canaries, and it is a singular fact that, if two
    top-knotted birds are matched, the young, instead of having very
    fine top-knots, are generally bald, or even have a wound on their
    heads.<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> It would appear as if the
    top-knot were due to some morbid condition, which is increased to
    an injurious degree when two birds in this state are paired. There
    is a feather-footed breed, and another with a kind of frill running
    down the breast. One other character deserves notice from being
    confined to one period of life, and from being strictly inherited
    at the same period; namely, the wing and tail feathers in prize
    canaries being black, "but this colour is retained only until the
    first moult; once moulted, the peculiarity ceases."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> Canaries differ much in disposition and
    character, and in some small degree in song. They produce eggs
    three or four times during the year.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H3>GOLD-FISH.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Besides mammals and birds, only a few animals
    belonging to the other great classes have been domesticated; but to
    show that it is an almost universal law that animals, when removed
    from their natural conditions of life, vary, and that races can be
    formed when selection is applied, it is necessary to say a few
    words on gold-fish, bees, and silk-moths.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Gold-fish (<I>Cyprinus auratus</I>) were
    introduced into Europe only two or three centuries ago; but they
    have been kept in confinement from an ancient period in China. Mr.
    Blyth<A href="#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> suspects, from the
    analogous variation of other fishes, that golden-coloured fish do
    not occur in a state of nature. These fishes frequently live under
    the most unnatural conditions, and their variability in colour,
    size, and in some important points of structure is very great. M.
    Sauvigny has described and given coloured drawings of no less than
    eighty-nine varieties.<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> Many of
    the varieties, however, such as triple tail-fins, etc., ought to be
    called monstrosities; but it is difficult to draw any distinct line
    between a variation and a monstrosity. As gold-fish are kept for
    ornament or curiosity, and as "the Chinese are just the people to
    have secluded a chance variety of any kind, and to have matched and
    paired from it,"<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> it might have
    been predicted that selection would have been largely practised in
    the formation of new breeds; and this is the case. In an old
    Chinese work it is said that fish with vermilion scales were first
    raised in confinement during the Sung dynasty (which commenced
    <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> 960), "and now they are cultivated in families
    everywhere for the sake of ornament." In another and more ancient
    work, it is said that "there is not a household where the gold-fish
    is not cultivated, in <I>rivalry</I> as to its colour, and as a
    source of profit," etc.<A href="#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> Although
    many breeds exist, it is a singular fact that the variations are
    often not inherited. Sir R. Heron<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
    kept many of these fishes, and placed all the deformed ones,
    namely, those destitute of dorsal fins and those furnished with a
    double anal fin, or triple tail, in a pond by themselves; but they
    did "not produce a greater proportion of deformed offspring than
    the perfect fishes."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Passing over an almost infinite diversity of
    colour, we meet with the most extraordinary modifications of
    structure. Thus, out of about two dozen specimens bought in London,
    Mr. Yarrell observed some with the dorsal fin extending along more
    than half the length of the back: others with this fin reduced to
    only five or six rays: and one with no dorsal fin. The anal fins
    are sometimes double, and the tail is often triple. This latter
    deviation of structure seems generally to occur "at the expense of
    the whole or part of some other fin;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> but Bory de Saint-Vincent<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> saw at Madrid gold-fish furnished with a
    dorsal fin and a triple tail. One variety is characterised by a
    hump on its back near the head; and the Rev. L. Jenyns<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A> has described a most singular variety,
    imported from China, almost globular in form like a Diodon, with
    "the fleshy part of the tail as if entirely cut away? the caudal
    fin being set on a little behind the dorsal and immediately above
    the anal." In this fish the anal and caudal fins were double; the
    anal fin being attached to the body in a vertical line: the eyes
    also were enormously large and protuberant.</P>

    <CENTER>
      <H3>HIVE-BEES.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Bees have been domesticated from an ancient
    period; if indeed their state can be considered one of
    domestication, for they search for their own food, with the
    exception of a little generally given to them during the winter.
    Their habitation is a hive instead of a hole in a tree. Bees,
    however, have been transported into almost every quarter of the
    world, so that climate ought to have produced whatever direct
    effect it is capable of producing. It is frequently asserted that
    the bees in different parts of Great Britain differ in size,
    colour, and temper; and Godron<A href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
    says that they are generally larger in the south than in other
    parts of France; it has also been asserted that the little brown
    bees of High Burgundy, when transported to La Bresse become large
    and yellow in the second generation. But these statements require
    confirmation. As far as size is concerned, it is known that bees
    produced in very old combs are smaller, owing to the cells having
    become smaller from the successive old cocoons. The best
    authorities<A href="#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> concur that, with the
    exception of the Ligurian race or species, presently to be
    mentioned, distinct breeds do not exist in Britain or on the
    Continent. There is, however, even in the same stock, some
    variability in colour. Thus, Mr. Woodbury states,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> that he has several times seen queen
    bees of the common kind annulated with yellow-like Ligurian queens,
    and the latter dark-coloured like common bees. He has also observed
    variations in the colour of the drones, without any corresponding
    difference in the queens or workers of the same hive. The great
    apiarian, Dzierzon, in answer to my queries on this subject,
    says,<A href="#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> that in Germany bees of
    some stocks are decidedly dark, whilst others are remarkable for
    their yellow colour. Bees also seem to differ in habits in
    different districts, for Dzierzon adds, "If many stocks with their
    offspring are more inclined to swarm, whilst others are richer in
    honey, so that some bee-keepers even distinguish between swarming
    and honey-gathering bees, this is a habit which has become second
    nature, caused by the customary mode of keeping the bees and the
    pasturage of the district. For example, what a difference in this
    respect one may perceive to exist between the bees of the Luneburg
    heath and those of this country!" . . . "Removing an old queen and
    substituting a young one of the current year is here an infallible
    mode of keeping the strongest stock from swarming and preventing
    drone-breeding; whilst the same means if adopted in Hanover would
    certainly be of no avail." I procured a hive full of dead bees from
    Jamaica, where they have long been naturalised, and, on carefully
    comparing them under the microscope with my own bees, I could
    detect not a trace of difference.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This remarkable uniformity in the hive-bee,
    wherever kept, may probably be accounted for by the great
    difficulty, or rather impossibility, of bringing selection into
    play by pairing particular queens and drones, for these insects
    unite only during flight. Nor is there any record, with a single
    partial exception, of any person having separated and bred from a
    hive in which the workers presented some appreciable difference. In
    order to form a new breed, seclusion from other bees would, as we
    now know, be indispensable; for since the introduction of the
    Ligurian bee into Germany and England, it has been found that the
    drones wander at least two miles from their own hives, and often
    cross with the queens of the common bee.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> The Ligurian bee, although perfectly
    fertile when crossed with the common kind, is ranked by most
    naturalists as a distinct species, whilst by others it is ranked as
    a variety: but this form need not here be noticed, as there is no
    reason to believe that it is the product of domestication. The
    Egyptian and some other bees are likewise ranked by Dr.
    Gerst&#228;cker,<A href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> but not by other
    highly competent judges, as geographical races; he grounds his
    conclusion in chief part on the fact that in certain districts, as
    in the Crimea and Rhodes, they vary so much in colour, that the
    several geographical races can be closely connected by intermediate
    forms.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I have alluded to a single instance of the
    separation and preservation of a particular stock of bees. Mr.
    Lowe<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> procured some bees from a
    cottager a few miles from Edinburgh, and perceived that they
    differed from the common bee in the hairs on the head and thorax
    being lighter coloured and more profuse in quantity. From the date
    of the introduction of the Ligurian bee into Great Britain we may
    feel sure that these bees had not been crossed with this form. Mr.
    Lowe propagated this variety, but unfortunately did not separate
    the stock from his other bees, and after three generations the new
    character was almost completely lost. Nevertheless, as he adds, "a
    great number of the bees still retain traces, though faint, of the
    original colony." This case shows us what could probably be
    effected by careful and long-continued selection applied
    exclusively to the workers, for, as we have seen, queens and drones

      <H3>SILK-MOTHS.</H3>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">These insects are in several respects
    interesting to us, more especially because they have varied largely
    at an early period of life, and the variations have been inherited
    at corresponding periods. As the value of the silk-moth depends
    entirely on the cocoon, every change in its structure and qualities
    has been carefully attended to, and races differing much in the
    cocoon, but hardly at all in the adult state, have been produced.
    With the races of most other domestic animals, the young resemble
    each other closely, whilst the adults differ much.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It would be useless, even if it were possible,
    to describe all the many kinds of silkworms. Several distinct
    species exist in India and China which produce useful silk, and
    some of these are capable of freely crossing with the common
    silk-moth, as has been recently ascertained in France. Captain
    Hutton<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> states that throughout the
    world at least six species have been domesticated; and he believes
    that the silk-moths reared in Europe belong to two or three
    species. This, however, is not the opinion of several capable
    judges who have particularly attended to the cultivation of this
    insect in France; and hardly accords with some facts presently to
    be given.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The common silk-moth (<I>Bombyx mori</I>) was
    brought to Constantinople in the sixth century, whence it was
    carried into Italy, and in 1494 into France.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> Everything has been favourable for the
    variation of this insect. It is believed to have been domesticated
    in China as long ago as 2700 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL> It has been kept
    under unnatural and diversified conditions of life, and has been
    transported into many countries. There is reason to believe that
    the nature of the food given to the caterpillar influences to a
    certain extent the character of the breed.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A> Disuse has apparently aided in checking
    the development of the wings. But the most important element in the
    production of the many now existing, much modified races, no doubt
    has been the close attention which has long been applied in many
    countries to every promising variation. The care taken in Europe in
    the selection of the best cocoons and moths for breeding is
    notorious,<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> and the production of
    eggs is followed as a distinct trade in parts of France. I have
    made inquiries through Dr. Falconer, and am assured that in India
    the natives are equally careful in the process of selection. In
    China the production of eggs is confined to certain favourable
    districts, and the raisers are precluded by law from producing
    silk, so that their whole attention may be necessarily given up to
    this one object.<A href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The following details on the differences
    between the several breeds are taken, when not stated to the
    contrary, from M. Robinet's excellent work,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> which bears every sign of care and large
    experience. The <I>eggs</I> in the different races vary in colour,
    in shape (being round, elliptic or oval), and in size. The eggs
    laid in June in the south of France, and in July in the central
    provinces, do not hatch until the following spring; and it is in
    vain, says M. Robinet, to expose them to a temperature gradually
    raised, in order that the caterpillar may be quickly developed. Yet
    occasionally, without any known cause, batches of eggs are
    produced, which immediately begin to undergo the proper changes,
    and are hatched in from twenty to thirty days. From these and some
    other analogous facts it may be concluded that the Trevoltini
    silkworms of Italy, of which the caterpillars are hatched in from
    fifteen to twenty days, do not necessarily form, as has been
    maintained, a distinct species. Although the breeds which live in
    temperate countries produce eggs which cannot be immediately
    hatched by artificial heat, yet when they are removed to and reared
    in a hot country they gradually acquire the character of quick
    development, as in the Trevoltini races.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Caterpillars.</I>&#8212;These vary
    greatly in size and colour. The skin is generally white, sometimes
    mottled with black or grey, and occasionally quite black. The
    colour, however, as M. Robinet asserts, is not constant, even in
    perfectly pure breeds; except in the race <I>tigr&#233;e,</I> so
    called from being marked with transverse black stripes. As the
    general colour of the caterpillar is not correlated with that of
    the silk,<A href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> this character is
    disregarded by cultivators, and has not been fixed by selection.
    Captain Hutton, in the paper before referred to, has argued with
    much force that the dark tiger-like marks, which so frequently
    appear during the later moults in the caterpillars of various
    breeds, are due to reversion; for the caterpillars of several
    allied wild species of Bombyx are marked and coloured in this
    manner. He separated some caterpillars with the tiger-like marks,
    and in the succeeding spring (pp. 149, 298) nearly all the
    caterpillars reared from them were dark-brindled, and the tints
    became still darker in the third generation. The moths reared from
    these caterpillars<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> also became
    darker, and resembled in colouring the wild <I>B. huttoni.</I> On
    this view of the tiger-like marks being due to reversion, the
    persistency with which they are transmitted is
    intelligible.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Several years ago Mrs. Whitby took great
    pains in breeding silkworms on a large scale, and she informed me
    that some of her caterpillars had dark eyebrows. This is probably
    the first step in reversion towards the tiger-like marks, and I was
    curious to know whether so trifling a character would be inherited.
    At my request she separated in 1848 twenty of these caterpillars,
    and having kept the moths separate, bred from them. Of the many
    caterpillars thus reared, "every one without exception had
    eyebrows, some darker and more decidedly marked than the others,
    but <I>all</I> had eyebrows more or less plainly visible." Black
    caterpillars occasionally appear amongst those of the common kind,
    but in so variable a manner, that, according to M. Robinet, the
    same race will one year exclusively produce white caterpillars, and
    the next year many black ones; nevertheless, I have been informed
    by M. A. Bossi of Geneva, that, if these black caterpillars are
    separately bred from, they reproduce the same colour; but the
    cocoons and moths reared from them do not present any
    difference.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The caterpillar in Europe ordinarily
    moults four times before passing into the cocoon stage; but there
    are races "&#224; trois mues," and the Trevoltini race likewise
    moults only thrice. It might have been thought that so important a
    physiological difference would not have arisen under domestication;
    but M. Robinet<A href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> states that, on
    the one hand, ordinary caterpillars occasionally spin their cocoons
    after only three moults, and, on the other hand, "presque toutes
    les races &#224; trois mues, que nous avons exp&#233;rimentees, ont
    fait quatre mues &#224; la seconde ou &#224; la troisi&#232;me
    ann&#233;e, ce qui semble prouver qu'il a suffi de les placer dans
    des conditions favorables pour leur rendre une facult&#233;
    qu'elles avaient perdue sous des influences moins
    favorables."</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Cocoons.</I>&#8212;The caterpillar in
    changing into the cocoon loses about 50 per cent of its weight; but
    the amount of loss differs in different breeds, and this is of
    importance to the cultivator. The cocoon in the different races
    presents characteristic differences; being large or
    small;&#8212;nearly spherical with no constriction, as in the Race
    de Loriol, or cylindrical, with either a deep or slight
    constriction in the middle; with the two ends, or with one end
    alone, more or less pointed. The silk varies in fineness and
    quality, and in being nearly white, but of two tints, or yellow.
    Generally the colour of the silk is not strictly inherited: but in
    the chapter on Selection I shall give a curious account how, in the
    course of sixty-five generations, the number of yellow cocoons in
    one breed has been reduced in France from one hundred to
    thirty-five in the thousand. According to Robinet, the white race,
    called Sina, by careful selection during the last seventy-five
    years, "est arriv&#233;e &#224; un tel &#233;tat de puret&#233;,
    qu'on ne voit pas un seul cocon jaune dans des millions de cocons
    blancs."<A href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A> Cocoons are sometimes
    formed, as is well known, entirely destitute of silk, which yet
    produce moths; unfortunately Mrs. Whitby was prevented by an
    accident from ascertaining whether this character would prove
    hereditary.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL><I>Adult stage.</I>&#8212;I can find no
    account of any constant difference in the moths of the most
    distinct races. Mrs. Whitby assured me that there was none in the
    several kinds bred by her; and I have received a similar statement
    from the eminent naturalist, M. de Quatrefages. Captain Hutton also
    says<A href="#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> that the moths of all kinds
    vary much in colour, but in nearly the same inconstant manner.
    Considering how much the cocoons in the several races differ, this
    fact is of interest, and may probably be accounted for on the same
    principle as the fluctuating variability of colour in the
    caterpillar, namely, that there has been no motive for selecting
    and perpetuating any particular variation.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The males of the wild Bombycid&#230; "fly
    swiftly in the day-time and evening, but the females are usually
    very sluggish and inactive."<A href="#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> In
    several moths of this family the females have abortive wings, but
    no instance is known of the males being incapable of flight, for in
    this case the species could hardly have been perpetuated. In the
    silk-moth both sexes have imperfect, crumpled wings, and are
    incapable of flight; but still there is a trace of the
    characteristic difference in the two sexes; for though, on
    comparing a number of males and females, I could detect no
    difference in the development of their wings, yet I was assured by
    Mrs. Whitby that the males of the moths bred by her used their
    wings more than the females, and could flutter downwards, though
    never upwards. She also states that, when the females first emerge
    from the cocoon, their wings are less expanded than those of the
    male. The degree of imperfection, however, in the wings varies much
    in different races and under different circumstances. M.
    Quatrefages<A href="#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A> says that he has seen
    a number of moths with their wings reduced to a third, fourth, or
    tenth part of their normal dimensions, and even to mere short
    straight stumps: "il me semble qu'il y a l&#224; un v&#233;ritable
    arr&#234;t de d&#233;veloppement partiel." On the other hand, he
    describes the female moths of the Andr&#233; Jean breed as having
    "leurs ailes larges et &#233;tal&#233;es. Un seul pr&#233;sente
    quelques courbures irr&#233;guli&#232;res et des plis anormaux." As
    moths and butterflies of all kinds reared from wild caterpillars
    under confinement often have crippled wings, the same cause,
    whatever it may be, has probably acted on silk-moths, but the
    disuse of their wings during so many generations has, it may be
    suspected, likewise come into play.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The moths of many breeds fail to glue
    their eggs to the surface on which they are laid,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A> but this proceeds, according to Capt.
    Hutton,<A href="#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A> merely from the glands of
    the ovipositor being weakened.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>As with other long-domesticated animals,
    the instincts of the silk-moth have suffered. The caterpillars,
    when placed on a mulberry-tree, often commit the strange mistake of
    devouring the base of the leaf on which they are feeding, and
    consequently fall down; but they are capable, according to M.
    Robinet,<A href="#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A> of again crawling up the
    trunk. Even this capacity sometimes fails, for M. Martins<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> placed some caterpillars on a tree, and
    those which fell were not able to remount and perished of hunger;
    they were even incapable of passing from leaf to leaf.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Some of the modifications which the
    silk-moth has undergone stand in correlation with one another.
    Thus, the eggs of the moths which produce white cocoons and of
    those which produce yellow cocoons differ slightly in tint. The
    abdominal feet, also, of the caterpillars which yield white cocoons
    are always white, whilst those which give yellow cocoons are
    invariably yellow.<A href="#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> We have seen
    that the caterpillars with dark tiger-like stripes produce moths
    which are more darkly shaded than other moths. It seems well
    established<A href="#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> that in France the
    caterpillars of the races which produce white silk, and certain
    black caterpillars, have resisted, better than other races, the
    disease which has recently devastated the silk-districts. Lastly,
    the races differ constitutionally, for some do not succeed so well
    under a temperate climate as others; and a damp soil does not
    equally injure all the races.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From these various facts we learn that
    silk-moths, like the higher animals, vary greatly under
    long-continued domestication. We learn also the more important fact
    that variations may occur at various periods of life, and be
    inherited at a corresponding period. And finally we see that
    insects are amenable to the great principle of Selection.</P>

      which were even worse in this respect. Some were hatched in ten
      days, and others not until after the lapse of many months. No
