    <P align="JUSTIFY">In this and the two following chapters I shall
    discuss, as well as the difficulty of the subject permits, the
    several laws which govern Variability. These may be grouped under
    the effects of use and disuse, including changed habits and
    acclimatisation&#8212;arrest of development&#8212;correlated
    variation&#8212;the cohesion of homologous parts-the variability of
    multiple parts&#8212;compensation of growth&#8212;the position of
    buds with respect to the axis of the plant&#8212;and lastly,
    analogous variation. These several subjects so graduate into one
    another that their distinction is often arbitrary.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It may be convenient first briefly to discuss
    that coordinating and reparative power which is common, in a higher
    or lower degree, to all organic beings, and which was formerly
    designated by physiologists as <I>nisus formativus.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Blumenbach and others<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> have insisted that the principle which
    permits a Hydra, when cut into fragments, to develop itself into
    two or more perfect animals, is the same with that which causes a
    wound in the higher animals to heal by a cicatrice. Such cases as
    that of the Hydra are evidently analogous to the spontaneous
    division or fissiparous generation of the lowest animals, and
    likewise to the budding of plants. Between these extreme cases and
    that of a mere cicatrice we have every gradation. Spallanzani<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A> by cutting off the legs and tail of
    a Salamander, got in the course of three months six crops of these
    members; so that 687 perfect bones were reproduced by one animal
    during one season. At whatever point the limb was cut off, the
    deficient part, and no more, was exactly reproduced. When a
    diseased bone has been removed, a new one sometimes "gradually
    assumes the regular form, and all the attachments of muscles,
    ligaments, etc., become as complete as before."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>This power of regrowth does not, however,
    always act perfectly; the reproduced tail of a lizard differs in
    the form of the scales from the normal tail: with certain
    Orthopterous insects the large hind legs are reproduced of smaller
    size:<A href="#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A> the white cicatrice which in
    the higher animals unites the edges of a deep wound is not formed
    of perfect skin, for elastic tissue is not produced till long
    afterwards.<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> "The activity of the
    <I>nisus formativus,</I>" says Blumenbach, "is in an inverse ratio
    to the age of the organised body." Its power is also greater with
    animals, the lower they stand in the scale of organisation; and
    animals low in the scale correspond with the embryos of higher
    animals belonging to the same class. Newport's observations<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> afford a good illustration of this fact,
    for he found that "myriapods, whose highest development scarcely
    carries them beyond the larva of perfect insects, can regenerate
    limbs and antennae up to the time of their last moult;" and so can
    the larvae of true insects, but, except in one order, not in the
    mature insect. Salamanders correspond in development with the
    tadpoles or larvae of the tailless Batrachians, and both possess to
    a large extent the power of regrowth; but not so the mature
    tailless Batrachians.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Absorption often plays an important part
    in the repair of injuries. When a bone is broken and does not
    unite, the ends are absorbed and rounded, so that a false joint is
    formed; or if the ends unite, but overlap, the projecting parts are
    removed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A> A dislocated bone will
    form for itself a new socket. Displaced tendons and varicose veins
    excavate new channels in the bones against which they press. But
    absorption comes into action, as Virchow remarks, during the normal
    growth of bones; parts which are solid during youth become hollowed
    out for the medullary tissue as the bone increases in size. In
    trying to understand the many well-adapted cases of regrowth when
    aided by absorption, we should remember that almost all parts of
    the organisation, even whilst retaining the same form, undergo
    constant renewal; so that a part which is not renewed would be
    liable to absorption.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Some cases, usually classed under the
    so-called <I>nisus formativus,</I> at first appear to come under a
    distinct head; for not only are old structures reproduced, but new
    structures are formed. Thus, after inflammation "false membranes,"
    furnished with blood-vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, are
    developed; or a f&#339;tus escapes from the Fallopian tubes, and
    falls into the abdomen, "nature pours out a quantity of plastic
    lymph, which forms itself into organised membrane, richly supplied
    with blood-vessels," and the f&#339;tus is nourished for a time. In
    certain cases of hydrocephalus the open and dangerous spaces in the
    skull are filled up with new bones, which interlock by perfect
    serrated sutures.<A href="#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> But most
    physiologists, especially on the Continent, have now given up the
    belief in plastic lymph or blastema, and Virchow<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> maintains that every structure, new or
    old, is formed by the proliferation of pre-existing cells. On this
    view false membranes, like cancerous or other tumours, are merely
    abnormal developments of normal growths; and we can thus understand
    how it is that they resemble adjoining structures; for instance,
    that a "false membrane in the serous cavities acquires a covering
    of epithelium exactly like that which covers the original serous
    membrane; adhesions of the iris may become black apparently from
    the production of pigment-cells like those of the uvea."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>No doubt the power of reparation, though
    not always perfect, is an admirable provision, ready for various
    emergencies, even for such as occur only at long intervals of
    time.<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A> Yet this power is not more
    wonderful than the growth and development of every single creature,
    more especially of those which are propagated by fissiparous
    generation. This subject has been here noticed, because we may
    infer that, when any part or organ is either greatly increased in
    size or wholly suppressed through variation and continued
    selection, the co-ordinating power of the organisation will
    continually tend to bring again all the parts into harmony with one
    another.</SMALL></P>

    <CENTER>
      <I>On the Effects of the Increased Use and Disuse of Organs.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It is notorious, and we shall immediately adduce
    proofs, that increased use or action strengthens muscles, glands,
    sense-organs, etc.; and that disuse, on the other hand, weakens
    them. It has been experimentally proved by Ranke<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>12</SUP></A> that the flow of blood is greatly
    increased towards any part which is performing work, and sinks
    again when the part is at rest. Consequently, if the work is
    frequent, the vessels increase in size and the part is better
    nourished. Paget<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> also accounts
    for the long, thick, dark-coloured hairs which occasionally grow,
    even in young children, near old-standing inflamed surfaces or
    fractured bones by an increased flow of blood to the part. When
    Hunter inserted the spur of a cock into the comb, which is well
    supplied with blood-vessels, it grew in one case spirally to a
    length of six inches, and in another case forward, like a horn, so
    that the bird could not touch the ground with its beak. According
    to the interesting observations of M. Sedillot,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> when a portion of one of the bones of
    the leg of an animal is removed, the associated bone enlarges till
    it attains a bulk equal to that of the two bones, of which it has
    to perform the functions. This is best exhibited in dogs in which
    the tibia has been removed; the companion bone, which is naturally
    almost filiform and not one-fifth the size of the other, soon
    acquires a size equal to or greater than that of the tibia. Now, it
    is at first difficult to believe that increased weight acting on a
    straight bone could, by alternately increasing and diminishing the
    pressure, cause the blood to flow more freely in the vessels which
    permeate the periosteum and thus supply more nutriment to the bone.
    Nevertheless the observations adduced by Mr. Spencer,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> on the strengthening of the bowed bones
    of rickety children, along their concave sides, leads to the belief
    that this is possible.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The rocking of the stem of a tree increases in a
    marked manner the growth of the woody tissue in the parts which are
    strained. Prof. Sachs believes, from reasons which he assigns, that
    this is due to the pressure of the bark being relaxed in such
    parts, and not as Knight and H. Spencer maintain, to an increased
    flow of sap caused by the movement of the trunk.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A> But hard woody tissue may be developed
    without the aid of any movement, as we see with ivy closely
    attached to an old wall. In all such cases, it is very difficult to
    distinguish between the effects of long-continued selection and
    those which follow from the increased action of the part, or
    directly from some other cause. Mr. H. Spencer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> acknowledges this difficulty, and gives
    as an instance the thorns on trees and the shells of nuts. Here we
    have extremely hard woody tissue without the possibility of any
    movement, and without, as far as we can see, any other directly
    exciting cause; and as the hardness of these parts is of manifest
    service to the plant, we may look at the result as probably due to
    the selection of so-called spontaneous variations. Every one knows
    that hard work thickens the epidermis on the hands; and when we
    hear that with infants, long before birth, the epidermis is thicker
    on the palms and soles of the feet than on any other part of the
    body, as was observed with admiration by Albinus,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> we are naturally inclined to attribute
    this to the inherited effects of long-continued use or pressure. We
    are tempted to extend the same view even to the hoofs of
    quadrupeds; but who will pretend to determine how far natural
    selection may have aided in the formation of structures of such
    obvious importance to the animal?</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>That use strengthens the muscles may be
    seen in the limbs of artisans who follow different trades; and when
    a muscle is strengthened, the tendons, and the crests of bone to
    which they are attached, become enlarged; and this must likewise be
    the case with the blood-vessels and nerves. On the other hand, when
    a limb is not used, as by Eastern fanatics, or when the nerve
    supplying it with nervous power is effectually destroyed, the
    muscles wither. So again, when the eye is destroyed the optic nerve
    becomes atrophied, sometimes even in the course of a few months.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> The Proteus is furnished with
    branchiae as well as with lungs: and Schreibers<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> found that when the animal was compelled
    to live in deep water, the branchiae were developed to thrice their
    ordinary size, and the lungs were partially atrophied. When, on the
    other hand, the animal was compelled to live in shallow water, the
    lungs became larger and more vascular, whilst the branchiae
    disappeared in a more or less complete degree. Such modifications
    as these are, however, of comparatively little value for us, as we
    do not actually know that they tend to be inherited.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>In many cases there is reason to believe
    that the lessened use of various organs has affected the
    corresponding parts in the offspring. But there is no good evidence
    that this ever follows in the course of a single generation. It
    appears, as in the case of general or indefinite variability, that
    several generations must be subjected to changed habits for any
    appreciable result. Our domestic fowls, ducks, and geese have
    almost lost, not only in the individual but in the race, their
    power of flight; for we do not see a young fowl, when frightened,
    take flight like a young pheasant. Hence I was led carefully to
    compare the limb-bones of fowls, ducks, pigeons, and rabbits, with
    the same bones in the wild parent-species. As the measurements and
    weights were fully given in the earlier chapters I need here only
    recapitulate the results. With domestic pigeons, the length of the
    sternum, the prominence of its crest, the length of the scapulae
    and furculum, the length of the wings as measured from tip to tip
    of the radii, are all reduced relatively to the same parts in the
    wild pigeon. The wing and tail feathers, however, are increased in
    length, but this may have as little connection with the use of the
    wings or tail, as the lengthened hair on a dog with the amount of
    exercise which it has habitually taken. The feet of pigeons, except
    in the long-beaked races, are reduced in size. With fowls the crest
    of the sternum is less prominent, and is often distorted or
    monstrous; the wing-bones have become lighter relatively to the
    leg-bones, and are apparently a little shorter in comparison with
    those of the parent-form, the <I>Gallus bankiva.</I> With ducks,
    the crest of the sternum is affected in the same manner as in the
    foregoing cases: the furculum, coracoids, and scapulae are all
    reduced in weight relatively to the whole skeleton: the bones of
    the wings are shorter and lighter, and the bones of the legs longer
    and heavier, relatively to each other, and relatively to the whole
    skeleton, in comparison with the same bones in the wild-duck. The
    decreased weight and size of the bones, in the foregoing cases, is
    probably the indirect result of the reaction of the weakened
    muscles on the bones. I failed to compare the feathers of the wings
    of the tame and wild duck; but Gloger<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> asserts that in the wild duck the tips
    of the wing-feathers reach almost to the end of the tail, whilst in
    the domestic duck they often hardly reach to its base. He remarks
    also on the greater thickness of the legs, and says that the
    swimming membrane between the toes is reduced; but I was not able
    to detect this latter difference.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With the domesticated rabbit the body,
    together with the whole skeleton, is generally larger and heavier
    than in the wild animal, and the leg-bones are heavier in due
    proportion; but whatever standard of comparison be taken, neither
    the leg-bones nor the scapulae have increased in length
    proportionally with the increased dimensions of the rest of the
    skeleton. The skull has become in a marked manner narrower, and,
    from the measurements of its capacity formerly given, we may
    conclude, that this narrowness results from the decreased size of
    the brain, consequent on the mentally inactive life led by these
    closely-confined animals.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We have seen in the eighth chapter that
    silk-moths, which have been kept during many centuries closely
    confined, emerge from their cocoons with their wings distorted,
    incapable of flight, often greatly reduced in size, or even,
    according to Quatrefages, quite rudimentary. This condition of the
    wings may be largely owing to the same kind of monstrosity which
    often affects wild Lepidoptera when artificially reared from the
    cocoon; or it may be in part due to an inherent tendency, which is
    common to the females of many Bombycidae, to have their wings in a
    more or less rudimentary state; but part of the effect may be
    attributed to long-continued disuse.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">From the foregoing facts there can be no doubt
    that with our anciently domesticated animals, certain bones have
    increased or decreased in size and weight owing to increased or
    decreased use; but they have not been modified, as shown in the
    earlier chapters, in shape or structure. With animals living a free
    life and occasionally exposed to severe competition the reduction
    would tend to be greater, as it would be an advantage to them to
    have the development of every superfluous part saved. With
    highly-fed domesticated animals, on the other hand, there seems to
    be no economy of growth, nor any tendency to the elimination of
    superfluous details. But to this subject I shall recur.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Turning now to more general observations,
    Nathusius has shown that with the improved races of the pig, the
    shortened legs and snout, the form of the articular condyles of the
    occiput, and the position of the jaws with the upper canine teeth
    projecting in a most anomalous manner in front of the lower
    canines, may be attributed to these parts not having been fully
    exercised. For the highly-cultivated races do not travel in search
    of food, nor root up the ground with their ringed muzzles.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> These modifications of structure, which
    are all strictly inherited, characterise several improved breeds,
    so that they cannot have been derived from any single domestic
    stock. With respect to cattle, Professor Tanner has remarked that
    the lungs and liver in the improved breeds "are found to be
    considerably reduced in size when compared with those possessed by
    animals having perfect liberty";<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
    and the reduction of these organs affects the general shape of the
    body. The cause of the reduced lungs in highly-bred animals which
    take little exercise is obvious; and perhaps the liver may be
    affected by the nutritious and artificial food on which they
    largely subsist. Again, Dr. Wilckens asserts<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> that various parts of the body certainly
    differ in Alpine and lowland breeds of several domesticated
    animals, owing to their different habits of life; for instance, the
    neck and fore-legs in length, and the hoofs in shape.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is well known that, when an artery is
    tied, the anastomosing branches, from being forced to transmit more
    blood, increase in diameter; and this increase cannot be accounted
    for by mere extension, as their coats gain in strength. With
    respect to glands, Sir J. Paget observes that "when one kidney is
    destroyed the other often becomes much larger, and does double
    work."<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> If we compare the size of
    the udders and their power of secretion in cows which have been
    long domesticated, and in certain breeds of the goat in which the
    udders nearly touch the ground, with these organs in wild or
    half-domesticated animals, the difference is great. A good cow with
    us daily yields more than five gallons, or forty pints of milk,
    whilst a first-rate animal, kept, for instance, by the Damaras of
    South Africa,<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> "rarely gives more
    than two or three pints of milk daily, and, should her calf be
    taken from her, she absolutely refuses to give any." We may
    attribute the excellence of our cows and of certain goats, partly
    to the continued selection of the best milking animals, and partly
    to the inherited effects of the increased action, through man's
    art, of the secreting glands.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>It is notorious that short-sight is
    inherited; and we have seen in the twelfth chapter from the
    statistical researches of M. Giraud-Teulon, that the habit of
    viewing near objects gives a tendency to short-sight. Veterinarians
    are unanimous that horses are affected with spavins, splints,
    ringbones, etc., from being shod and from travelling on hard roads,
    and they are almost equally unanimous that a tendency to these
    malformations is transmitted. Formerly horses were not shod in
    North Carolina, and it has been asserted that they did not then
    suffer from these diseases of the legs and feet.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">Our domesticated quadrupeds are all descended,
    as far as is known, from species having erect ears; yet few kinds
    can be named, of which at least one race has not drooping ears.
    Cats in China, horses in parts of Russia, sheep in Italy and
    elsewhere, the guinea-pig formerly in Germany, goats and cattle in
    India, rabbits, pigs, and dogs in all long-civilised countries have
    dependent ears. With wild animals, which constantly use their ears
    like funnels to catch every passing sound, and especially to
    ascertain the direction whence it comes, there is not, as Mr. Blyth
    has remarked, any species with drooping ears except the elephant.
    Hence the incapacity to erect the ears is certainly in some manner
    the result of domestication; and this incapacity has been
    attributed by various authors<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> to
    disuse, for animals protected by man are not compelled habitually
    to use their ears. Col. Hamilton Smith<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> states that in ancient effigies of the
    dog, "with the exception of one Egyptian instance, no sculpture of
    the earlier Grecian era produces representations of hounds with
    completely drooping ears; those with them half pendulous are
    missing in the most ancient; and this character increases, by
    degrees, in the works of the Roman period." Godron also has
    remarked "that the pigs of the ancient Egyptians had not their ears
    enlarged and pendent."<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> But it is
    remarkable that the drooping of the ear is not accompanied by any
    decrease in size; on the contrary, animals so different as fancy
    rabbits, certain Indian breeds of the goat, our petted spaniels,
    blood-hounds, and other dogs, have enormously elongated ears, so
    that it would appear as if their weight had caused them to droop,
    aided perhaps by disuse. With rabbits, the drooping of the much
    elongated ears has affected even the structure of the skull.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The tail of no wild animal, as remarked to me by
    Mr. Blyth, is curled; whereas pigs and some races of dogs have
    their tails much curled. This deformity, therefore, appears to be
    the result of domestication, but whether in any way connected with
    the lessened use of the tail is doubtful.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The epidermis on our hands is easily thickened,
    as every one knows, by hard work. In a district of Ceylon the sheep
    have "horny callosities that defend their knees, and which arise
    from their habit of kneeling down to crop the short herbage, and
    this distinguishes the Jaffna flocks from those of other portions
    of the island;" but it is not stated whether this peculiarity is
    inherited.<A href="#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The mucous membrane which lines the stomach is
    continuous with the external skin of the body; therefore it is not
    surprising that its texture should be affected by the nature of the
    food consumed, but other and more interesting changes likewise
    follow. Hunter long ago observed that the muscular coat of the
    stomach of a gull (<I>Larus tridactylus</I>) which had been fed for
    a year chiefly on grain was thickened; and, according to Dr.
    Edmondston, a similar change periodically occurs in the Shetland
    Islands in the stomach of the <I>Larus argentatus,</I> which in the
    spring frequents the cornfields and feeds on the seed. The same
    careful observer has noticed a great change in the stomach of a
    raven which had been long fed on vegetable food. In the case of an
    owl (<I>Strix grallaria</I>), similarly treated, Menetries states
    that the form of the stomach was changed, the inner coat became
    leathery, and the liver increased in size. Whether these
    modifications in the digestive organs would in the course of
    generations become inherited is not known.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The increased or diminished length of the
    intestines, which apparently results from changed diet, is a more
    remarkable case, because it is characteristic of certain animals in
    their domesticated condition, and therefore must be inherited. The
    complex absorbent system, the blood-vessels, nerves, and muscles,
    are necessarily all modified together with the intestines.
    According to Daubenton, the intestines of the domestic cat are
    one-third longer than those of the wild cat of Europe; and although
    this species is not the parent-stock of the domestic animal, yet,
    as Isidore Geoffroy has remarked, the several species of cats are
    so closely allied that the comparison is probably a fair one. The
    increased length appears to be due to the domestic cat being less
    strictly carnivorous in its diet than any wild feline species; for
    instance, I have seen a French kitten eating vegetables as readily
    as meat. According to Cuvier, the intestines of the domesticated
    pig exceed greatly in proportionate length those of the wild boar.
    In the tame and wild rabbit the change is of an opposite nature,
    and probably results from the nutritious food given to the tame
    rabbit.<A href="#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Changed and inherited Habits of
    Life.</I>&#8212;This subject, as far as the mental powers of
    animals are concerned, so blends into instinct, that I will here
    only remind the reader of such cases as the tameness of our
    domesticated animals&#8212;the pointing or retrieving of
    dogs&#8212; their not attacking the smaller animals kept by
    man&#8212;and so forth. How much of these changes ought to be
    attributed to mere habit, and how much to the selection of
    individuals which have varied in the desired manner, irrespectively
    of the special circumstances under which they have been kept, can
    seldom be told.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We have already seen that animals may be
    habituated to a changed diet; but some additional instances may be
    given. In the Polynesian Islands and in China the dog is fed
    exclusively on vegetable matter, and the taste for this kind of
    food is to a certain extent inherited.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A> Our sporting dogs will not touch the
    bones of game birds, whilst most other dogs devour them with
    greediness. In some parts of the world sheep have been largely fed
    on fish. The domestic hog is fond of barley, the wild boar is said
    to disdain it; and the disdain is partially inherited, for some
    young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this
    grain, whilst others of the same brood relished it.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> One of my relations bred some young pigs
    from a Chinese sow by a wild Alpine boar; they lived free in the
    park, and were so tame that they came to the house to be fed; but
    they would not touch swill, which was devoured by the other pigs.
    An animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet, which can
    generally be effected only during youth, dislikes its proper food,
    as Spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been
    long fed on meat. Individuals of the same species take to new food
    with different degrees of readiness; one horse, it is stated, soon
    learned to eat meat, whilst another would have perished from hunger
    rather than have partaken of it.<A href="#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
    The caterpillars of the <I>Bombyx hesperus</I> feed in a state of
    nature on the leaves of the <I>Caf&#233; diable,</I> but, after
    having been reared on the Ailanthus, they would not touch the <I>
    Caf&#233; diable,</I> and actually died of hunger.<A href=

    <P align="JUSTIFY">It has been found possible to accustom marine
    fish to live in fresh water; but as such changes in fish and other
    marine animals have been chiefly observed in a state of nature,
    they do not properly belong to our present subject. The period of
    gestation and of maturity, as shown in the earlier
    chapters,&#8212;the season and the frequency of the act of
    breeding,&#8212;have all been greatly modified under domestication.
    With the Egyptian goose the rate of change with respect to the
    season has been recorded.<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> The
    wild drake pairs with one female, the domestic drake is polygamous.
    Certain breeds of fowls have lost the habit of incubation. The
    paces of the horse, and the manner of flight of certain breeds of
    the pigeon, have been modified and are inherited. Cattle, horses,
    and pigs have learnt to browse under water in the St. John's River,
    East Florida, where the Vallisneria has been largely naturalised.
    The cows were observed by Prof. Wyman to keep their heads immersed
    for "a period varying from fifteen to thirty-five seconds."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> The voice differs much in certain kinds
    of fowls and pigeons. Some varieties are clamorous and others
    silent, as the Call and common duck, or the Spitz and pointer dog.
    Every one knows how the breeds of the dog differ from one another
    in their manner of hunting, and in their ardour after different
    kinds of game or vermin.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With plants the period of vegetation is easily
    changed and is inherited, as in the case of summer and winter
    wheat, barley, and vetches; but to this subject we shall
    immediately return under acclimatisation. Annual plants sometimes
    become perennial under a new climate, as I hear from Dr. Hooker is
    the case with the stock and mignonette in Tasmania. On the other
    hand, perennials sometimes become annuals, as with the Ricinus in
    England, and as, according to Captain Mangles, with many varieties
    of the heartsease. Von Berg<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
    raised from seed of <I>Verbascum ph&#339;niceum,</I> which is
    usually a biennial, both annual and perennial varieties. Some
    deciduous bushes become evergreen in hot countries.<A href=

    one variety in India which can be grown without irrigation.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> Certain varieties of the oat and of our
    other cereals are best fitted for certain soils.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> Endless similar facts could be given in
    the animal and vegetable kingdoms. They are noticed here because
    they illustrate analogous differences in closely allied natural
    species, and because such changed habits of life, whether due to
    habit, or to the direct action of external conditions, or to
    so-called spontaneous variability, would be apt to lead to
    modifications of structure.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><I>Acclimatisation.</I>&#8212;From the previous
    remarks we are naturally led to the much disputed subject of
    acclimatisation. There are two distinct questions: Do varieties
    descended from the same species differ in their power of living
    under different climates? And secondly, if they so differ, how have
    they become thus adapted? We have seen that European dogs do not
    succeed well in India, and it is asserted,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> that no one has there succeeded in
    keeping the Newfoundland long alive; but then it may be argued, and
    probably with truth, that these northern breeds are specifically
    distinct from the native dogs which flourish in India. The same
    remark may be made with respect to different breeds of sheep, of
    which, according to Youatt,<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> not
    one brought "from a torrid climate lasts out the second year," in
    the Zoological Gardens. But sheep are capable of some degree of
    acclimatisation, for Merino sheep bred at the Cape of Good Hope
    have been found far better adapted for India than those imported
    from England.<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A> It is almost
    certain that all the breeds of the fowl are descended from one
    species; but the Spanish breed, which there is good reason to
    believe originated near the Mediterranean,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> though so fine and vigorous in England,
    suffers more from frost than any other breed. The Arrindy silk moth
    introduced from Bengal, and the Ailanthus moth from the temperate
    province of Shan Tung, in China, belong to the same species, as we
    may infer from their identity in the caterpillar, cocoon, and
    mature states;<A href="#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> yet they differ
    much in constitution: the Indian form "will flourish only in warm
    latitudes," the other is quite hardy and withstands cold and
    rain.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Plants are more strictly adapted to
    climate than are animals. The latter when domesticated withstand
    such great diversities of climate, that we find nearly the same
    species in tropical and temperate countries; whilst the cultivated
    plants are widely dissimilar. Hence a larger field is open for
    inquiry in regard to the acclimatisation of plants than of animals.
    It is no exaggeration to say that with almost every plant which has
    long been cultivated, varieties exist which are endowed with
    constitutions fitted for very different climates; I will select
    only a few of the more striking cases, as it would be tedious to
    give all. In North America numerous fruit-trees have been raised,
    and in horticultural publications,&#8212;for instance, in that by
    Downing,&#8212;lists are given of the varieties which are best able
    to withstand the severe climate of the northern States and Canada.
    Many American varieties of the pear, plum, and peach are excellent
    in their own country, but until recently, hardly one was known that
    succeeded in England; and with apples,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A> not one succeeds. Though the American
    varieties can withstand a severer winter than ours, the summer here
    is not hot enough. Fruit-trees have also originated in Europe with
    different constitutions, but they are not much noticed, because
    nurserymen here do not supply wide areas. The Forelle pear flowers
    early, and when the flowers have just set, and this is the critical
    period, they have been observed, both in France and England, to
    withstand with complete impunity a frost of 18 deg and even
    14&#176; Fahr., which killed the flowers, whether fully expanded or
    in bud, of all other kinds of pears.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> This power in the flower of resisting
    cold and afterwards producing fruit does not invariably depend, as
    we know on good authority,<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> on
    general constitutional vigour. In proceeding northward, the number
    of varieties which are found capable of resisting the climate
    rapidly decreases, as may be seen in the list of the varieties of
    the cherry, apple, and pear, which can be cultivated in the
    neighbourhood of Stockholm.<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> Near
    Moscow, Prince Troubetzkoy planted for experiment in the open
    ground several varieties of the pear, but one alone, the <I>Poire
    sans Pepins,</I> withstood the cold of winter.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> We thus see that our fruit-trees, like
    distinct species of the same genus, certainly differ from each
    other in their constitutional adaptation to different
    climates.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With the varieties of many plants, the
    adaptation to climate is often very close. Thus it has been proved
    by repeated trials "that few if any of the English varieties of
    wheat are adapted for cultivation in Scotland";<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> but the failure in this case is at first
    only in the quantity, though ultimately in the quality, of the
    grain produced. The Rev. M. J. Berkeley sowed wheat-seed from
    India, and got "the most meagre ears," on land which would
    certainly have yielded a good crop from English wheat.<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> In these cases varieties have been
    carried from a warmer to a cooler climate; in the reverse case, as
    "when wheat was imported directly from France into the West Indian
    Islands, it produced either wholly barren spikes or furnished with
    only two or three miserable seeds, while West Indian seed by its
    side yielded an enormous harvest."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> Here is another case of close adaptation
    to a slightly cooler climate; a kind of wheat which in England may
    be used indifferently either as a winter or summer variety, when
    sown under the warmer climate of Grignan, in France, behaved
    exactly as if it had been a true winter wheat.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Botanists believe that all the varieties
    of maize belong to the same species; and we have seen that in North
    America, in proceeding northward, the varieties cultivated in each
    zone produce their flowers and ripen their seed within shorter and
    shorter periods. So that the tall, slowly maturing southern
    varieties do not succeed in New England, and the New English
    varieties do not succeed in Canada. I have not met with any
    statement that the southern varieties are actually injured or
    killed by a degree of cold which the northern varieties can
    withstand with impunity, though this is probable; but the
    production of early flowering and early seeding varieties deserves
    to be considered as one form of acclimatisation. Hence it has been
    found possible, according to Kalm, to cultivate maize further and
    further northwards in America. In Europe, also, as we learn from
    the evidence given by Alph. De Candolle, the culture of maize has
    extended since the end of the last century thirty leagues north of
    its former boundary.<A href="#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> On the
    authority of Linn&#230;us,<A href="#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> I may
    quote an analogous case, namely, that in Sweden tobacco raised from
    home-grown seed ripens its seed a month sooner and is less liable
    to miscarry than plants raised from foreign seed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With the Vine, differently from the
    maize, the line of practical culture has retreated a little
    southward since the middle ages;<A href="#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
    but this seems due to commerce being now easier, so that it is
    better to import wine from the south than to make it in northern
    districts. Nevertheless the fact of the vine not having spread
    northward shows that acclimatisation has made no progress during
    several centuries. There is, however, a marked difference in the
    constitution of the several varieties,&#8212; some being hardy,
    whilst others, like the muscat of Alexandria, require a very high
    temperature to come to perfection. According to Labat,<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> vines taken from France to the West
    Indies succeed with extreme difficulty, whilst those imported from
    Madeira or the Canary Islands thrive admirably.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Gallesio gives a curious account of the
    naturalisation of the Orange in Italy. During many centuries the
    sweet orange was propagated exclusively by grafts, and so often
    suffered from frosts, that it required protection. After the severe
    frost of 1709, and more especially after that of 1763, so many
    trees were destroyed, that seedlings from the sweet orange were
    raised, and, to the surprise of the inhabitants, their fruit was
    found to be sweet. The trees thus raised were larger, more
    productive, and hardier than the old kinds; and seedlings are now
    continually raised. Hence Gallesio concludes that much more was
    effected for the naturalisation of the orange in Italy by the
    accidental production of new kinds during a period of about sixty
    years, than had been effected by grafting old varieties during many
    ages.<A href="#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> I may add that Risso<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> describes some Portuguese varieties
    of the orange as extremely sensitive to cold, and as much tenderer
    than certain other varieties.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>The peach was known to Theophrastus, 322
    B.C.<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> According to the authorities
    quoted by Dr. F. Rolle,<A href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> it was
    tender when first introduced into Greece, and even in the island of
    Rhodes only occasionally bore fruit. If this be correct, the peach,
    in spreading during the last two thousand years over the middle
    parts of Europe, must have become much hardier. At the present day
    different varieties differ much in hardiness: some French varieties
    will not succeed in England; and near Paris, the <I>Pavie de
    Bonneuil</I> does not ripen its fruit till very late in the season,
    even when grown on a wall; "it is, therefore, only fit for a very
    hot southern climate."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>I will briefly give a few other cases. A
    variety of <I>Magnolia grandiflora,</I> raised by M. Roy,
    withstands a temperature several degrees lower than that which any
    other variety can resist. With camellias there is much difference
    in hardiness. One particular variety of the Noisette rose withstood
    the severe frost of 1860 "untouched and hale amidst a universal
    destruction of other Noisettes." In New York the "Irish yew is
    quite hardy, but the common yew is liable to be cut down." I may
    add that there are varieties of the sweet potato (<I>Convolvulus
    batatas</I>) which are suited for warmer, as well as for colder,
    climates.<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The plants as yet mentioned have been found
    capable of resisting an unusual degree of cold or heat, when fully
    grown. The following cases refer to plants whilst young. In a large
    bed of young Araucarias of the same age, growing close together and
    equally exposed, it was observed,<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A>
    after the unusually severe winter of 1860-61, that, "in the midst
    of the dying, numerous individuals remained on which the frost had
    absolutely made no kind of impression." Dr. Lindley, after alluding
    to this and other similar cases, remarks, "Among the lessons which
    the late formidable winter has taught us, is that, even in their
    power of resisting cold, individuals of the same species of plants
    are remarkably different." Near Salisbury, there was a sharp frost
    on the night of May 24, 1836, and all the French beans
    (<I>Phaseolus vulgaris</I>) in a bed were killed except about one
    in thirty, which completely escaped.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> On the same day of the month, but in the
    year 1864, there was a severe frost in Kent, and two rows of
    scarlet-runners (<I>P. multiflorus</I>) in my garden, containing
    390 plants of the same age and equally exposed, were all blackened
    and killed except about a dozen plants. In an adjoining row of
    "Fulmer's dwarf bean" (<I>P. vulgaris</I>), one single plant
    escaped. A still more severe frost occurred four days afterwards,
    and of the dozen plants which had previously escaped only three
    survived; these were not taller or more vigorous than the other
    young plants, but they escaped completely, with not even the tips
    of their leaves browned. It was impossible to behold these three
    plants, with their blackened, withered, and dead brethren all
    around, and not see at a glance that they differed widely in
    constitutional power of resisting frost.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">This work is not the proper place to show that
    wild plants of the same species, naturally growing at different
    altitudes or under different latitudes, become to a certain extent
    acclimatised, as is proved by the different behaviour of their
    seedlings when raised in another country. In my 'Origin of Species'
    I have alluded to some cases, and I could add many others. One
    instance must suffice: Mr. Grigor, of Forres,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A> states that seedlings of the Scotch fir
    (<I>Pinus sylvestris</I>), raised from seed from the Continent and
    from the forests of Scotland, differ much. "The difference is
    perceptible in one-year-old, and more so in two-year-old seedlings;
    but the effects of the winter on the second year's growth almost
    uniformly make those from the Continent quite brown, and so
    damaged, that by the month of March they are quite unsaleable,
    while the plants from the native Scotch pine, under the same
    treatment, and standing alongside, although considerably shorter,
    are rather stouter and quite green, so that the beds of the one can
    be known from the other when seen from the distance of a mile."
    Closely similar facts have been observed with seedling larches.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Hardy varieties would alone be valued or
    noticed in Europe; whilst tender varieties, requiring more warmth,
    would generally be neglected; but such occasionally arise. Thus
    Loudon<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> describes a Cornish
    variety of the elm which is almost an evergreen, and of which the
    shoots are often killed by the autumnal frosts, so that its timber
    is of little value. Horticulturists know that some varieties are
    much more tender than others: thus all the varieties of the
    broccoli are more tender than cabbages; but there is much
    difference in this respect in the sub-varieties of the broccoli;
    the pink and purple kinds are a little hardier than the white Cape
    broccoli, "but they are not to be depended on after the thermometer
    falls below 24&#176; Fahr.;" the Walcheren broccoli is less tender
    than the Cape, and there are several varieties which will stand
    much severer cold than the Walcheren.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> Cauliflowers seed more freely in India
    than cabbages.<A href="#refer"><SUP>73</SUP></A> To give one
    instance with flowers: eleven plants raised from a hollyhock,
    called the <I>Queen of the Whites,</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> were found to be much more tender than
    various other seedlings. It may be presumed that all tender
    varieties would succeed better under a climate warmer than ours.
    With fruit-trees, it is well known that certain varieties, for
    instance of the peach, stand forcing in a hot-house better than
    others; and this shows either pliability of organisation or some
    constitutional difference. The same individual cherry-tree, when
    forced, has been observed during successive years gradually to
    change its period of vegetation.<A href="#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A>
    Few pelargoniums can resist the heat of a stove, but <I>Alba
    Multiflora</I> will, as a most skilful gardener asserts, "stand
    pine-apple top and bottom heat the whole winter; without looking
    any more drawn than if it had stood in a common greenhouse; and <I>
    Blanche Fleur</I> seems as if it had been made on purpose for
    growing in winter, like many bulbs, and to rest all summer."<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>76</SUP></A> There can hardly be a doubt that
    the <I>Alba Multiflora</I> pelargonium must have a widely different
    constitution from that of most other varieties of this plant; it
    would probably withstand even an equatorial climate.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>We have seen that according to Labat the
    vine and wheat require acclimatisation in order to succeed in the
    West Indies. Similar facts have been observed at Madras: "two
    parcels of mignonette-seed, one direct from Europe, the other saved
    at Bangalore (of which the mean temperature is much below that of
    Madras), were sown at the same time: they both vegetated equally
    favourably, but the former all died off a few days after they
    appeared above ground; the latter still survive, and are vigorous,
    healthy plants." "So again, turnip and carrot seed saved at
    Hyderabad are found to answer better at Madras than seed from
    Europe or from the Cape of Good Hope."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>77</SUP></A> Mr. J. Scott of the Calcutta Botanic
    Gardens, informs me that seeds of the sweet-pea (<I>Lathyrus
    odoratus</I>) imported from England produce plants, with thick,
    rigid stems and small leaves, which rarely blossom and never yield
    seed; plants raised from French seed blossom sparingly, but all the
    flowers are sterile; on the other hand, plants raised from
    sweet-peas grown near Darjeeling in Upper India, but originally
    derived from England, can be successfully cultivated on the plains
    of India; for they flower and seed profusely, and their stems are
    lax and scandent. In some of the foregoing cases, as Dr. Hooker has
    remarked to me, the greater success may perhaps be attributed to
    the seeds having been more fully ripened under a more favourable
    climate; but this view can hardly be extended to so many cases,
    including plants, which, from being cultivated under a climate
    hotter than their native one, become fitted for a still hotter
    climate. We may therefore safely conclude that plants can to a
    certain extent become accustomed to a climate either hotter or
    colder than their own; although the latter cases have been more
    frequently observed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">We will now consider the means by which
    acclimatisation may be effected, namely, through the appearance of
    varieties having a different constitution, and through the effects
    of habit. In regard to new varieties, there is no evidence that a
    change in the constitution of the offspring necessarily stands in
    any direct relation with the nature of the climate inhabited by the
    parents. On the contrary, it is certain that hardy and tender
    varieties of the same species appear in the same country. New
    varieties thus spontaneously arising become fitted to slightly
    different climates in two different ways; firstly, they may have
    the power, either as seedlings or when full-grown, of resisting
    intense cold, as with the Moscow pear, or of resisting intense
    heat, as with some kinds of Pelargonium, or the flowers may
    withstand severe frost, as with the Forelle pear. Secondly, plants
    may become adapted to climates widely different from their own,
    from flowering and fruiting either earlier or later in the season.
    In both these cases the power of acclimatisation by man consists
    simply in the selection and preservation of new varieties. But
    without any direct intention on his part of securing a hardier
    variety, acclimatisation may be unconsciously effected by merely
    raising tender plants from seed, and by occasionally attempting
    their cultivation further and further northwards, as in the case of
    maize, the orange and the peach.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">How much influence ought to be attributed to
    inherited habit or custom in the acclimatisation of animals and
    plants is a much more difficult question. In many cases natural
    selection can hardly have failed to have come into play and
    complicated the result. It is notorious that mountain sheep resist
    severe weather and storms of snow which would destroy lowland
    breeds; but then mountain sheep have been thus exposed from time
    immemorial, and all delicate individuals will have been destroyed,
    and the hardiest preserved. So with the Arrindy silk-moths of China
    and India; who can tell how far natural selection may have taken a
    share in the formation of the two races, which are now fitted for
    such widely different climates? It seems at first probable that the
    many fruit-trees which are so well fitted for the hot summers and
    cold winters of North America, in contrast with their poor success
    under our climate, have become adapted through habit; but when we
    reflect on the multitude of seedlings annually raised in that
    country, and that none would succeed unless born with a fitting
    constitution, it is possible that mere habit may have done nothing
    towards their acclimatisation. On the other hand, when we hear that
    Merino sheep, bred during no great number of generations at the
    Cape of Good Hope&#8212;that some European plants raised during
    only a few generations in the cooler parts of India, withstand the
    hotter parts of that country much better than the sheep or seeds
    imported directly from England, we must attribute some influence to
    habit. We are led to the same conclusion when we hear from Naudin<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>78</SUP></A> that the races of melons, squashes,
    and gourds, which have long been cultivated in Northern Europe, are
    comparatively more precocious, and need much less heat for maturing
    their fruit, than the varieties of the same species recently
    brought from tropical regions. In the reciprocal conversion of
    summer and winter wheat, barley, and vetches into each other, habit
    produces a marked effect in the course of a very few generations.
    The same thing apparently occurs with the varieties of maize,
    which, when carried from the Southern States of America, or into
    Germany, soon became accustomed to their new homes. With
    vine-plants taken to the West Indies from Madeira, which are said
    to succeed better than plants brought directly from France, we have
    some degree of acclimatisation in the individual, independently of
    the production of new varieties by seed.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">The common experience of agriculturists is of
    some value, and they often advise persons to be cautious in trying
    the productions of one country in another. The ancient agricultural
    writers of China recommend the preservation and cultivation of the
    varieties peculiar to each country. During the classical period,
    Columella wrote, "Vernaculum pecus peregrino longe pr&#230;stantius
    est."<A href="#refer"><SUP>79</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the attempt to acclimatise
    either animals or plants has been called a vain chimera. No doubt
    the attempt in most cases deserves to be thus called, if made
    independently of the production of new varieties endowed with a
    different constitution. With plants propagated by buds, habit
    rarely produces any effect; it apparently acts only through
    successive seminal generations. The laurel, bay, laurestinus, etc.,
    and the Jerusalem artichoke, which are propagated by cuttings or
    tubers, are probably now as tender in England as when first
    introduced; and this appears to be the case with the potato, which
    until recently was seldom multiplied by seed. With plants
    propagated by seed, and with animals, there will be little or no
    acclimatisation unless the hardier individuals are either
    intentionally or unconsciously preserved. The kidney-bean has often
    been advanced as an instance of a plant which has not become
    hardier since its first introduction into Britain. We hear,
    however, on excellent authority<A href="#refer"><SUP>80</SUP></A>
    that some very fine seed, imported from abroad, produced plants
    "which blossomed most profusely, but were nearly all but abortive,
    whilst plants grown alongside from English seed podded abundantly;"
    and this apparently shows some degree of acclimatisation in our
    English plants. We have also seen that seedlings of the kidney-bean
    occasionally appear with a marked power of resisting frost; but no
    one, as far as I can hear, has ever separated such hardy seedlings,
    so as to prevent accidental crossing, and then gathered their seed,
    and repeated the process year after year. It may, however, be
    objected with truth that natural selection ought to have had a
    decided effect on the hardiness of our kidney-beans; for the
    tenderest individuals must have been killed during every severe
    spring, and the hardier preserved. But it should be borne in mind
    that the result of increased hardiness would simply be that
    gardeners, who are always anxious for as early a crop as possible,
    would sow their seed a few days earlier than formerly. Now, as the
    period of sowing depends much on the soil and elevation of each
    district, and varies with the season; and as new varieties have
    often been imported from abroad, can we feel sure that our
    kidney-beans are not somewhat hardier? I have not been able, by
    searching old horticultural works, to answer this question
    satisfactorily.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">On the whole the facts now given show that,
    though habit does something towards acclimatisation, yet that the
    appearance of constitutionally different individuals is a far more
    effective agent. As no single instance has been recorded either
    with animals or plants of hardier individuals having been long and
    steadily selected, though such selection is admitted to be
    indispensable for the improvement of any other character, it is not
    surprising that man has done little in the acclimatisation of
    domesticated animals and cultivated plants. We need not, however,
    doubt that under nature new races and new species would become
    adapted to widely different climates, by variation, aided by habit,
    and regulated by natural selection.</P>

      <I>Arrests of Development: Rudimentary and Aborted Organs.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Modifications of structure from arrested
    development, so great or so serious as to deserve to be called
    monstrosities, are not infrequent with domesticated animals, but,
    as they differ much from any normal structure, they require only a
    passing notice. Thus the whole head may be represented by a soft
    nipple-like projection, and the limbs by mere papillae. These
    rudiments of limbs are sometimes inherited, as has been observed in
    a dog.<A href="#refer"><SUP>81</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>Many lesser anomalies appear to be due to
    arrested development. What the cause of the arrest may be, we
    seldom know, except in the case of direct injury to the embryo.
    That the cause does not generally act at an extremely early
    embryonic period we may infer from the affected organ seldom being
    wholly aborted,&#8212;a rudiment being generally preserved. The
    external ears are represented by mere vestiges in a Chinese breed
    of sheep; and in another breed, the tail is reduced "to a little
    button, suffocated in a manner, by fat."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>82</SUP></A> In tailless dogs and cats a stump is
    left. In certain breeds of fowls the comb and wattles are reduced
    to rudiments; in the Cochin-China breed scarcely more than
    rudiments of spurs exist. With polled Suffolk cattle, "rudiments of
    horns can often be felt at an early age";<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>83</SUP></A> and with species in a state of nature,
    the relatively great development of rudimentary organs at an early
    period of life is highly characteristic of such organs. With
    hornless breeds of cattle and sheep, another and singular kind of
    rudiment has been observed, namely, minute dangling horns attached
    to the skin alone, and which are often shed and grow again. With
    hornless goats, according to Desmarest,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>84</SUP></A> the bony protuberance which properly
    supports the horn exists as a mere rudiment.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With cultivated plants it is far from
    rare to find the petals, stamens, and pistils represented by
    rudiments, like those observed in natural species. So it is with
    the whole seed in many fruits; thus, near Astrakhan there is a
    grape with mere traces of seeds, "so small and lying so near the
    stalk that they are not perceived in eating the grape."<A href= 
    "#refer"><SUP>85</SUP></A> In certain varieties of the gourd, the
    tendrils, according to Naudin, are represented by rudiments or by
    various monstrous growths. In the broccoli and cauliflower the
    greater number of the flowers are incapable of expansion, and
    include rudimentary organs. In the Feather hyacinth (<I>Muscari
    comosum</I>) in its natural state the upper and central flowers are
    brightly coloured but rudimentary; under cultivation the tendency
    to abortion travels downwards and outwards, and all the flowers
    become rudimentary; but the abortive stamens and pistils are not so
    small in the lower as in the upper flowers. In the <I>Viburnum
    opulus,</I> on the other hand, the outer flowers naturally have
    their organs of fructification in a rudimentary state, and the
    corolla is of large size; under cultivation, the change spreads to
    the centre, and all the flowers become affected. In the compositae,
    the so-called doubling of the flowers consists in the greater
    development of the corolla of the central florets, generally
    accompanied with some degree of sterility; and it has been
    observed<A href="#refer"><SUP>86</SUP></A> that the progressive
    doubling invariably spreads from the circumference to the
    centre,&#8212;that is, from the ray florets, which so often include
    rudimentary organs, to those of the disc. I may add, as bearing on
    this subject, that with Asters, seeds taken from the florets of the
    circumference have been found to yield the greatest number of
    double flowers.<A href="#refer"><SUP>87</SUP></A> In the above
    cases we have a natural tendency in certain parts to be
    rudimentary, and this under culture spreads either to, or from, the
    axis of the plant. It deserves notice, as showing how the same laws
    govern the changes which natural species and artificial varieties
    undergo, that in the species of Carthamus, one of the Compositae, a
    tendency to the abortion of the pappus may be traced extending from
    the circumference to the centre of the disc as in the so-called
    doubling of the flowers in the members of the same family. Thus,
    according to A. de Jussieu,<A href="#refer"><SUP>88</SUP></A> the
    abortion is only partial in <I>Carthamus creticus,</I> but more
    extended in <I>C. lanatus</I>; for in this species only two or
    three of the central seeds are furnished with a pappus, the
    surrounding seeds being either quite naked or furnished with a few
    hairs; and lastly in <I>C. tinctorius,</I> even the central seeds
    are destitute of pappus, and the abortion is complete.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL>With animals and plants under
    domestication, when an organ disappears, leaving only a rudiment,
    the loss has generally been sudden, as with hornless and tailless
    breeds; and such cases may be ranked as inherited monstrosities.
    But in some few cases the loss has been gradual, and has been
    effected partly by selection, as with the rudimentary combs and
    wattles of certain fowls. We have also seen that the wings of some
    domesticated birds have been slightly reduced by disuse, and the
    great reduction of the wings in certain silk-moths, with mere
    rudiments left, has probably been aided by disuse.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With species in a state of nature, rudimentary
    organs are extremely common. Such organs are generally variable, as
    several naturalists have observed; for, being useless, they are not
    regulated by natural selection, and they are more or less liable to
    reversion. The same rule certainly holds good with parts which have
    become rudimentary under domestication. We do not know through what
    steps under nature rudimentary organs have passed in being reduced
    to their present condition; but we so incessantly see in species of
    the same group the finest gradations between an organ in a
    rudimentary and perfect state, that we are led to believe that the
    passage must have been extremely gradual. It may be doubted whether
    a change of structure so abrupt as the sudden loss of an organ
    would ever be of service to a species in a state of nature; for the
    conditions to which all organisms are closely adapted usually
    change very slowly. Even if an organ did suddenly disappear in some
    one individual by an arrest of development, intercrossing with the
    other individuals of the same species would tend to cause its
    partial reappearance; so that its final reduction could only be
    effected by some other means. The most probable view is, that a
    part which is now rudimentary, was formerly, owing to changed
    habits of life, used less and less, being at the same time reduced
    in size by disuse, until at last it became quite useless and
    superfluous. But as most parts or organs are not brought into
    action during an early period of life, disuse or decreased action
    will not lead to their reduction until the organism arrives at a
    somewhat advanced age; and from the principle of inheritance at
    corresponding ages the reduction will be transmitted to the
    offspring at the same advanced stage of growth. The part or organ
    will thus retain its full size in the embryo, as we know to be the
    case with most rudiments. As soon as a part becomes useless,
    another principle, that of economy of growth, will come into play,
    as it would be an advantage to an organism exposed to severe
    competition to save the development of any useless part; and
    individuals having the part less developed will have a slight
    advantage over others. But, as Mr. Mivart has justly remarked, as
    soon as a part is much reduced, the saving from its further
    reduction will be utterly insignificant; so that this cannot be
    effected by natural selection. This manifestly holds good if the
    part be formed of mere cellular tissue, entailing little
    expenditure of nutriment. How then can the further reduction of an
    already somewhat reduced part be effected? That this has occurred
    repeatedly under Nature is shown by the many gradations which exist
    between organs in a perfect state and the merest vestiges of them.
    Mr. Romanes<A href="#refer"><SUP>89</SUP></A> has, I think, thrown
    much light on this difficult problem. His view, as far as it can be
    given in a few words, is as follows: all parts are somewhat
    variable and fluctuate in size round an average point. Now, when a
    part has already begun from any cause to decrease, it is very
    improbable that the variations should be as great in the direction
    of increase as of diminution; for the previous reduction shows that
    circumstances have not been favourable for its development; whilst
    there is nothing to check variations in the opposite direction. If
    this be so, the long continued crossing of many individuals
    furnished with an organ which fluctuates in a greater degree
    towards decrease than towards increase, will slowly but steadily
    lead to its diminution. With respect to the complete and absolute
    abortion of a part, a distinct principle, which will be discussed
    in the chapter on pangenesis, probably comes into action.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY">With animals and plants reared by man there is
    no severe or recurrent struggle for existence, and the principle of
    economy will not come into action, so that the reduction of an
    organ will not thus be aided. So far, indeed, is this from being
    the case, that in some few instances organs, which are naturally
    rudimentary in the parent-species, become partially redeveloped in
    the domesticated descendants. Thus cows, like most other ruminants,
    properly have four active and two rudimentary mamma; but in our
    domesticated animals, the latter occasionally become considerably
    developed and yield milk. The atrophied mammae, which, in male
    domesticated animals, including man, have in some rare cases grown
    to full size and secreted milk, perhaps offer an analogous case.
    The hind feet of dogs naturally include rudiments of a fifth toe,
    and in certain large breeds these toes, though still rudimentary,
    become considerably developed and are furnished with claws. In the
    common Hen, the spurs and comb are rudimentary, but in certain
    breeds these become, independently of age or disease of the ovaria,
    well developed. The stallion has canine teeth, but the mare has
    only traces of the alveoli, which, as I am informed by the eminent
    veterinarian Mr. G. T. Brown, frequently contain minute irregular
    nodules of bone. These nodules, however, sometimes become developed
    into imperfect teeth, protruding through the gums and coated with
    enamel; and occasionally they grow to a fourth or even a third of
    the length of the canines in the stallion. With plants I do not
    know whether the redevelopment of rudimentary organs occurs more
    frequently under culture than under nature. Perhaps the pear-tree
    may be a case in point, for when wild it bears thorns, which
    consist of branches in a rudimentary condition and serve as a
    protection, but, when the tree is cultivated, they are reconverted
    into branches.</P>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">I suggested in 'Nature' (vol. 8 pp. 432, 505) that with
      organisms subjected to unfavourable conditions all the parts
      would tend towards reduction, and that under such circumstances
      any part which was not kept up to its standard size by natural
      selection would, owing to intercrossing, slowly but steadily
      decrease. In three subsequent communications to 'Nature' (March
      12, April 9, and July 2, 1874), Mr. Romanes gives his improved
      view.</FONT></LI>
