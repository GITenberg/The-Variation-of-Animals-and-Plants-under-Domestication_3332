    <P align="JUSTIFY">As some naturalists may not be familiar with the
    chief breeds of the fowl, it will be advisable to give a condensed
    description of them.<A href="#refer"><SUP>1</SUP></A> From what I
    have read and seen of specimens brought from several quarters of
    the world, I believe that most of the chief kinds have been
    imported into England, but many sub-breeds are probably still
    unknown here. The following discussion on the origin of the various
    breeds and on their characteristic differences does not pretend to
    completeness, but may be of some interest to the naturalist. The
    classification of the breeds cannot, as far as I can see, be made
    natural. They differ from each other in different degrees, and do
    not afford characters in subordination to each other, by which they
    can be ranked in group under group. They seem all to have diverged
    by independent and different roads from a single type. Each chief
    breed includes differently coloured sub-varieties, most of which
    can be truly propagated, but it would be superfluous to describe
    them. I have classed the various crested fowls as sub-breeds under
    the Polish fowl; but I have great doubts whether this is a natural
    arrangement, showing true affinity or blood relationship. It is
    scarcely possible to avoid laying stress on the commonness of a
    breed; and if certain foreign sub-breeds had been largely kept in
    this country they would perhaps have been raised to the rank of
    main-breeds. Several breeds are abnormal in character; that is,
    they differ in certain points from all wild Gallinaceous birds. At
    first I made a division of the breeds into normal and abnormal, but
    the result was wholly unsatisfactory.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 1. GAME BREED.&#8212;This may be
    considered as the typical breed, as it deviates only slightly from
    the wild <I>Gallus bankiva,</I> or, as perhaps more correctly
    named, <I>ferrugineus.</I> Beak strong; comb single and upright.
    Spurs long and sharp. Feathers closely appressed to the body. Tail
    with the normal number of 14 feathers. Eggs often pale buff.
    Disposition indomitably courageous, exhibited even in the hens and
    chickens. An unusual number of differently coloured varieties
    exist, such as black and brown-breasted reds, duckwings, blacks,
    whites, piles, etc., with their legs of various
    colours.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 2. MALAY BREED.&#8212;Body of great
    size, with head, neck, and legs elongated; carriage erect; tail
    small, sloping downwards, generally formed of 16 feathers; comb and
    wattle small; ear-lobe and face red; skin yellowish; feathers
    closely appressed to the body; neck-hackles short, narrow, and
    hard. Eggs often pale buff. Chickens feather late. Disposition
    savage. Of Eastern origin.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 3. COCHIN, OR SHANGAI BREED.&#8212;Size
    great; wing feathers short, arched, much hidden in the soft downy
    plumage; barely capable of flight; tail short, generally formed of
    16 feathers, developed at a late period in the young males; legs
    thick, feathered; spurs short, thick; nail of middle toe flat and
    broad; an additional toe not rarely developed; skin yellowish. Comb
    and wattle well developed. Skull with deep medial furrow; occipital
    foramen, sub-triangular, vertically elongated. Voice peculiar. Eggs
    rough, buff-coloured. Disposition extremely quiet. Of Chinese
    origin.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 4. DORKING BREED.&#8212;Size great; body
    square, compact; feet with an additional toe; comb well developed,
    but varies much in form; wattles well developed; colour of plumage
    various. Skull remarkably broad between the orbits. Of English
    origin.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The white Dorking may be considered as a
    distinct sub-breed, being a less massive bird.</SMALL></P>

    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 5. SPANISH BREED (fig. 30).&#8212;Tall,
    with stately carriage; tarsi long; comb single, deeply serrated, of
    immense size; wattles largely developed; the large ear-lobes and
    sides of face white. Plumage black glossed with green. Do not
    incubate. Tender in constitution, the comb being often injured by
    frost. Eggs white, smooth, of large size. Chickens feather late but
    the young cocks show their masculine characters, and crow at an
    early age. Of Mediterranean origin.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The <I>Andalusians</I> may be ranked as
    a sub-breed: they are of a slaty-blue colour, and their chickens
    are well feathered. A smaller, short-legged Dutch sub-breed has
    been described by some authors as distinct.</SMALL></P>

      <IMG alt="Fig. 31&#8212;Hamburgh Fowl" src="../Images/fig31.jpg"
      width="299" height="344">
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 6. HAMBURGH BREED (fig 31).&#8212;Size
    moderate; comb flat, produced backwards, covered with numerous
    small points; wattle of moderate dimensions; ear lobe white; legs
    blueish, thin. Do not incubate. Skull, with the tips of the
    ascending branches of the premaxillary and with the nasal bones
    standing a little separate from each other; anterior margin of the
    frontal bones less depressed than usual.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> There are two sub-breeds; the <I>
    spangled</I> Hamburgh, of English origin, with the tips of the
    feathers marked with a dark spot; and the <I>pencilled</I>
    Hamburgh, of Dutch origin, with dark transverse lines across each
    feather, and with the body rather smaller. Both these sub-breeds
    include gold and silver varieties, as well as some other
    sub-varieties. Black Hamburghs have been produced by a cross with
    the Spanish breed.</SMALL></P>

      <IMG alt="Fig. 32&#8212;Polish Fowl" src="../Images/fig32.jpg"
      width="319" height="385">
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 7. CRESTED OR POLISH BREED (fig
    32).&#8212;Head with a large, rounded crest of feathers, supported
    on a hemispherical protuberance of the frontal bones, which
    includes the anterior part of the brain. The ascending branches of
    premaxillary bones and the inner nasal processes are much
    shortened. The orifice of the nostrils raised and crescentic. Beak
    short. Comb absent, or small and of crescentic shape; wattles
    either present or replaced by a beard-like tuft of feathers. Legs
    leaden-blue. Sexual differences appear late in life. Do not
    incubate. There are several beautiful varieties which differ in
    colour and slightly in other respects.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The following sub-breeds agree in having
    a crest, more or less developed, with the comb, when present, of
    crescentic shape. The skull presents nearly the same remarkable
    peculiarities of structure as in the true Polish fowl.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(a) Sultans.</I>&#8212;A
    Turkish breed, resembling white Polish fowls with a large crest and
    beard with short and well-feathered legs. The tail is furnished
    with additional sickle feathers. Do not incubate.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(b)
    Ptarmigans.</I>&#8212;An inferior breed closely allied to the last,
    white, rather small, legs much feathered, with the crest pointed;
    comb small, cupped; wattles small.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(c)
    Ghoondooks.</I>&#8212;Another Turkish breed having an extraordinary
    appearance; black and tailless; crest and beard large; legs
    feathered. The inner processes of the two nasal bones come into
    contact with each other, owing to the complete abortion of the
    ascending branches of the premaxillaries. I have seen an allied
    white, tailless breed from Turkey.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(d)
    Cr&#232;ve-c&#339;ur.</I>&#8212;A French breed of large size,
    barely capable of flight, with short black legs, head crested, comb
    produced into two points or horns, sometimes a little branched like
    the horns of a stag; both beard and wattles present. Eggs large.
    Disposition quiet.<A href="#refer"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(e) Horned
    fowl.</I>&#8212;With a small crest; comb produced into two great
    points, supported on two bony protuberances.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(f) Houdan.</I>&#8212;A
    French breed; of moderate size, short-legged with five toes, well
    developed; plumage invariably mottled with black, white, and
    straw-yellow; head furnished with a crest, on a triple comb placed
    transversely; both wattles and beard present.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Sub-breed <I>(g)
    Guelderlands.</I>&#8212;No comb, head said to be surmounted by a
    longitudinal crest of soft velvety feathers; nostrils said to be
    crescentic; wattles well developed; legs feathered; colour black.
    From North America. The Breda fowl seems to be closely allied to
    the Guelderland.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 8. BANTAM BREED.&#8212;Originally from
    Japan<A href="#refer"><SUP>5</SUP></A> characterised by small size
    alone; carriage bold and erect. There are several sub-breeds, such
    as the Cochin, Game, and Sebright Bantams, some of which have been
    recently formed by various crosses. The Black Bantam has a
    differently shaped skull, with the occipital foramen like that of
    the Cochin fowl.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 9. RUMPLESS FOWLS.&#8212;These are so
    variable in character<A href="#refer"><SUP>6</SUP></A> that they
    hardly deserve to be called a breed. Any one who will examine the
    caudal vertebr&#230; will see how monstrous the breed
    is.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 10. CREEPERS OR JUMPERS.&#8212;These are
    characterised by an almost monstrous shortness of legs, so that
    they move by jumping rather than by walking; they are said not to
    scratch up the ground. I have examined a Burmese variety, which had
    a skull of rather unusual shape.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 11. FRIZZLED OR CAFFRE FOWLS.&#8212;Not
    uncommon in India, with the feathers curling backwards, and with
    the primary feathers of the wing and tail imperfect; periosteum of
    bones black.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 12. SILK FOWLS.&#8212;Feathers silky,
    with the primary wing and tail-feathers imperfect; skin and
    periosteum of bones black; comb and wattles dark leaden-blue;
    ear-lappets tinged with blue; legs thin, often furnished with an
    additional toe. Size rather small.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> 13. SOOTY FOWLS.&#8212;An Indian breed,
    having the peculiar appearance of a white bird smeared with soot,
    with black skin and periosteum. The hens alone are thus
    characterised.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> From this synopsis we see that the several
    breeds differ considerably, and they would have been nearly as
    interesting for us as pigeons, if there had been equally good
    evidence that all had descended from one parent-species. Most
    fanciers believe that they are descended from several primitive
    stocks. The Rev. E. S. Dixon<A href="#refer"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
    argues strongly on this side of the question; and one fancier even
    denounces the opposite conclusion by asking, "Do we not perceive
    pervading this spirit, the spirit of the <I>Deist</I>?" Most
    naturalists, with the exception of a few, such as Temminck, believe
    that all the breeds have proceeded from a single species; but
    authority on such a point goes for little. Fanciers look to all
    parts of the world as the possible sources of their unknown stocks;
    thus ignoring the laws of geographical distribution. They know well
    that the several kinds breed truly even in colour. They assert,
    but, as we shall see, on very weak grounds, that most of the breeds
    are extremely ancient. They are strongly impressed with the great
    difference between the chief kinds, and they ask with force, can
    differences in climate, food, or treatment have produced birds so
    different as the black stately Spanish, the diminutive elegant
    Bantam, the heavy Cochin with its many peculiarities, and the
    Polish fowl with its great top-knot and protuberant skull? But
    fanciers, whilst admitting and even overrating the effects of
    crossing the various breeds, do not sufficiently regard the
    probability of the occasional birth, during the course of
    centuries, of birds with abnormal and hereditary peculiarities;
    they overlook the effects of correlation of growth&#8212;of the
    long-continued use and disuse of parts, and of some direct result
    from changed food and climate, though on this latter head I have
    found no sufficient evidence; and lastly, they all, as far as I
    know, entirely overlook the all-important subject of unconscious or
    unmethodical selection, though they are well aware that their birds
    differ individually and that by selecting the best birds for a few
    generations they can improve their stocks.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> An amateur writes<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>8</SUP></A> as follows: "The fact that poultry have
    until lately received but little attention at the hands of the
    fancier, and been entirely confined to the domains of the producer
    for the market, would alone suggest the improbability of that
    constant and unremitting attention having been observed in
    breeding, which is requisite to the consummating in the offspring
    of any two birds transmittable forms not exhibited by the parents."
    This at first sight appears true. But in a future chapter on
    Selection, abundant facts will be given showing not only that
    careful breeding, but that actual selection was practised during
    ancient periods, and by barely civilised races of man. In the case
    of the fowl I can adduce no direct facts showing that selection was
    anciently practised; but the Romans at the commencement of the
    Christian era kept six or seven breeds, and Columella "particularly
    recommends as the best, those sorts that have five toes and white
    ears."<A href="#refer"><SUP>9</SUP></A> In the fifteenth century
    several breeds were known and described in Europe; and in China, at
    nearly the same period, seven kinds were named. A more striking
    case is that at present, in one of the Philippine Islands, the
    semi-barbarous inhabitants have distinct native names for no less
    than nine sub-breeds of the Game fowl.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Azara,<A href="#refer"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
    who wrote towards the close of the last century, states that in the
    interior parts of South America, where I should not have expected
    that the least care would have been taken of poultry, a
    black-skinned and black-boned breed is kept, from being considered
    fertile and its flesh good for sick persons. Now every one who has
    kept poultry knows how impossible it is to keep several breeds
    distinct unless the utmost care be taken in separating the sexes.
    Will it then be pretended that those persons who, in ancient times
    and in semi-civilised countries took pains to keep the breeds
    distinct, and who therefore valued them, would not occasionally
    have destroyed inferior birds and occasionally have preserved their
    best birds? This is all that is required. It is not pretended that
    any one in ancient times intended to form a new breed, or to modify
    an old breed according to some ideal standard of excellence. He who
    cared for poultry would merely wish to obtain, and afterwards to
    rear, the best birds which he could; but this occasional
    preservation of the best birds would in the course of time modify
    the breed, as surely, though by no means as rapidly, as does
    methodical selection at the present day, If one person out of a
    hundred or out of a thousand attended to the breeding of his birds,
    this would be sufficient; for the birds thus tended would soon
    become superior to others, and would form a new strain; and this
    strain would, as explained in the last chapter, slowly have its
    characteristic differences augmented, and at last be converted into
    a new sub-breed or breed. But breeds would often be for a time
    neglected and would deteriorate; they would, however, partially
    retain their character, and afterwards might again come into
    fashion and be raised to a standard of perfection higher than their
    former standard; as has actually occurred quite recently with
    Polish fowls. If, however, a breed were utterly neglected, it would
    become extinct, as has recently happened with one of the Polish
    sub-breeds. Whenever in the course of past centuries a bird
    appeared with some slight abnormal structure, such as with a
    lark-like crest on its head, it would probably often have been
    preserved from that love of novelty which leads some persons in
    England to keep rumpless fowls, and others in India to keep
    frizzled fowls. And after a time any such abnormal appearance would
    be carefully preserved, from being esteemed a sign of the purity
    and excellence of the breed; for on this principle the Romans
    eighteen centuries ago valued the fifth toe and the white ear-lobe
    in their fowls.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Thus from the occasional appearance of abnormal
    characters, though at first only slight in degree; from the effects
    of the use and the disuse of parts; possibly from the direct
    effects of changed climate and food; from correlation of growth;
    from occasional reversions to old and long-lost characters; from
    the crossing of breeds, when more than one had been formed; but,
    above all, from unconscious selection carried on during many
    generations, there is no insuperable difficulty, to the best of my
    judgment, in believing that all the breeds have descended from some
    one parent-source. Can any single species be named from which we
    may reasonably suppose that all are descended? The Gallus bankiva
    apparently fulfils every requirement. I have already given as fair
    an account as I could of the arguments in favour of the multiple
    origin of the several breeds; and now I will give those in favour
    of their common descent from <I>G. bankiva.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> But it will be convenient first briefly
    to describe all the known species of Gallus. The <I>G.
    sonneratii</I> does not range into the northern parts of India;
    according to Colonel Sykes, it presents at different heights of the
    Ghauts, two strongly marked varieties, perhaps deserving to be
    called species. It was at one time thought to be the primitive
    stock of all our domestic breeds, and this shows that it closely
    approaches the common fowl in general structure; but its hackles
    partially consist of highly peculiar, horny lamin&#230;,
    transversely banded with three colours; and I have met no authentic
    account of any such character having been observed in any domestic
    breed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>13</SUP></A> This species also differs
    greatly from the common fowl, in the comb being finely serrated,
    and in the loins being destitute of true hackles. Its voice is
    utterly different. It crosses readily in India with domestic hens;
    and Mr. Blyth<A href="#refer"><SUP>14</SUP></A> raised nearly 100
    hybrid chickens; but they were tender and mostly died whilst young.
    Those which were reared were absolutely sterile when crossed inter
    se or with either parent. At the Zoological Gardens, however, some
    'hybrids of the same parentage were not quite so sterile: Mr.
    Dixon, as he informed me, made, with Mr. Yarrell's aid, particular
    inquiries on this subject, and was assured that out of 50 eggs only
    five or six chickens were reared. Some, however, of these half-bred
    birds were crossed with one of their parents, namely, a Bantam, and
    produced a few extremely feeble chickens. Mr. Dixon also procured
    some of these same birds and crossed them in several ways, but all
    were more or less infertile. Nearly similar experiments have
    recently been tried on a great scale in the Zoological Gardens with
    almost the same result.<A href="#refer"><SUP>15</SUP></A> Out of
    500 eggs, raised from various first crosses and hybrids, between
    <I>G. sonneratii, bankiva,</I> and <I>varius,</I> only 12 chickens
    were reared, and of these only three were the product of hybrids
    <I>inter se.</I> From these facts, and from the above-mentioned
    strongly-marked differences in structure between the domestic fowl
    and <I>G. sonneratii,</I> we may reject this latter species as the
    parent of any domestic breed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Ceylon possesses a fowl peculiar to the
    island, viz. <I>G. stanleyii</I>; this species approaches so
    closely (except in the colouring of the comb) to the domestic fowl,
    that Messrs. Layard and Kellaert<A href="#refer"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
    would have considered it, as they inform me, as one of the
    parent-stocks, had it not been for its singularly different voice.
    This bird, like the last, crosses readily with tame hens, and even
    visits solitary farms and ravishes them. Two hybrids, a male and
    female, thus produced, were found by Mr. Mitford to be quite
    sterile: both inherited the peculiar voice of <I>G. stanleyii.</I>
    This species, then, may in all probability be rejected as one of
    the primitive stocks of the domestic fowl.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Java and the islands eastward as far as
    Flores are inhabited by <I>G. varius</I> (or <I>furcatus</I>),
    which differs in so many characters&#8212;green plumage, unserrated
    comb, and single median wattle&#8212;that no one supposes it to
    have been the parent of any one of our breeds; yet, as I am
    informed by Mr. Crawfurd,<A href="#refer"><SUP>17</SUP></A> hybrids
    are commonly raised between the male <I>G. varius</I> and the
    common hen, and are kept for their great beauty, but are invariably
    sterile: this, however, was not the case with some bred in the
    Zoological Gardens. These hybrids were at one time thought to be
    specifically distinct, and were named <I>G. &#230;neus.</I> Mr.
    Blyth and others believe that the <I>G. temminckii</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>18</SUP></A> (of which the history is not known) is a
    similar hybrid. Sir J. Brooke sent me some skins of domestic fowls
    from Borneo, and across the tail of one of these, as Mr. Tegetmeier
    observed, there were transverse blue bands like those which he had
    seen on the tail-feathers of hybrids from <I>G. varius,</I> reared
    in the Zoological Gardens. This fact apparently indicates that some
    of the fowls of Borneo have been slightly affected by crosses with
    <I>G. varius,</I> but the case may possibly be one of analogous
    variation. I may just allude to the <I>G. giganteus,</I> so often
    referred to in works on poultry as a wild species; but Marsden<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>19</SUP></A> the first describer, speaks of it
    as a tame breed; and the specimen in the British Museum evidently
    has the aspect of a domestic variety.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The last species to be mentioned,
    namely, <I>Gallus bankiva,</I> has a much wider geographical range
    than the three previous species; it inhabits Northern India as far
    west as Sinde, and ascends the Himalaya to a height of 4000 ft.; it
    inhabits Burmah, the Malay peninsula, the Indo-Chinese countries,
    the Philippine Islands, and the Malayan archipelago as far eastward
    as Timor. This species varies considerably in the wild state. Mr.
    Blyth informs me that the specimens, both male and female, brought
    from near the Himalaya, are rather paler coloured than those from
    other parts of India; whilst those from the Malay peninsula and
    Java are brighter coloured than the Indian birds. I have seen
    specimens from these countries, and the difference of tint in the
    hackles was conspicuous. The Malayan hens were a shade redder on
    the breast and neck than the Indian hens. The Malayan males
    generally had a red ear-lappet, instead of a white one as in India;
    but Mr. Blyth has seen one Indian specimen without the white
    ear-lappet. The legs are leaden blue in the Indian, whereas they
    show some tendency to be yellowish in the Malayan and Javan
    specimens. In the former Mr. Blyth finds the tarsus remarkably
    variable in length. According to Temminck<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>20</SUP></A> the Timor specimens differ as a local
    race from that of Java. These several wild varieties have not as
    yet been ranked as distinct species; if they should, as is not
    unlikely, be hereafter thus ranked, the circumstance would be quite
    immaterial as far as the parentage and differences of our domestic
    breeds are concerned. The wild <I>G. bankiva</I> agrees most
    closely with the black-breasted red Game-breed, in colouring and in
    all other respects, except in being smaller, and in the tail being
    carried more horizontally. But the manner in which the tail is
    carried is highly variable in many of our breeds, for, as Mr. Brent
    informs me, the tail slopes much in the Malays, is erect in the
    Games and some other breeds, and is more than erect in Dorkings,
    Bantams, etc. There is one other difference namely, that in <I>G.
    bankiva,</I> according to Mr. Blyth, the neck-hackles when first
    moulted are replaced during two or three months not by other
    hackles, as with our domestic poultry, but by short blackish
    feathers.<A href="#refer"><SUP>21</SUP></A> Mr. Brent, however, has
    remarked that these black feathers remain in the wild bird after
    the development of the lower hackles, and appear in the domestic
    bird at the same time with them: so that the only difference is
    that the lower hackles are replaced more slowly in the wild than in
    the tame bird; but as confinement is known sometimes to affect the
    masculine plumage, this slight difference cannot be considered of
    any importance. It is a significant fact that the voice of both the
    male and female <I>G. bankiva</I> closely resembles, as Mr. Blyth
    and others have noted, the voice of both sexes of the common
    domestic fowl; but the last note of the crow of the wild bird is
    rather less prolonged. Captain Hutton, well known for his
    researches into the natural history of India, informs me that he
    has seen several crossed fowls from the wild species and the
    Chinese bantam; these crossed fowls <I>bred freely</I> with
    bantams, but unfortunately were not crossed <I>inter se.</I>
    Captain Hutton reared chickens from the eggs of the <I>Gallus
    bankiva</I>; and these, though at first very wild, afterwards
    became so tame that they would crowd round his feet. He did not
    succeed in rearing them to maturity; but as he remarks, "no wild
    gallinaceous bird thrives well at first on hard grain." Mr. Blyth
    also found much difficulty in keeping <I>G. bankiva</I> in
    confinement. In the Philippine Islands, however, the natives must
    succeed better, as they keep wild cocks to fight with their
    domestic game-birds.<A href="#refer"><SUP>22</SUP></A> Sir Walter
    Elliot informs me that the hen of a native domestic breed of Pegu
    is undistinguishable from the hen of the wild <I>G. bankiva</I>;
    and the natives constantly catch wild cocks by taking tame cocks to
    fight with them in the woods.<A href="#refer"><SUP>23</SUP></A> Mr.
    Crawfurd remarks that from etymology it might be argued that the
    fowl was first domesticated by the Malays and Javanese.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>24</SUP></A> It is also a curious fact, of which I
    have been assured by Mr. Blyth, that wild specimens of the <I>
    Gallus bankiva,</I> brought from the countries east of the Bay of
    Bengal, are far more easily tamed than those of India; nor is this
    an unparalleled fact, for, as Humboldt long ago remarked, the same
    species sometimes evinces a more tameable disposition in one
    country than in another. If we suppose that the <I>G. bankiva</I>
    was first tamed in Malaya and afterwards imported into India, we
    can understand an observation made to me by Mr. Blyth, that the
    domestic fowls of India do not resemble the wild <I>G. bankiva</I>
    of India more closely than do those of Europe.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> From the extremely close resemblance in colour,
    general structure, and especially in voice, between <I>Gallus
    bankiva</I> and the Game fowl; from their fertility, as far as this
    has been ascertained, when crossed; from the possibility of the
    wild species being tamed, and from its varying in the wild state,
    we may confidently look at it as the parent of the most typical of
    all the domestic breeds, namely, the Game fowl. It is a significant
    fact, that almost all the naturalists in India, namely Sir W.
    Elliot, Mr. S. N. Ward, Mr. Layard, Mr. J. C. Jerdon, and Mr.
    Blyth,<A href="#refer"><SUP>25</SUP></A> who are familiar with G.
    bankiva, believe that it is the parent of most or all our domestic
    breeds. But even if it be admitted that G. bankiva is the parent of
    the Game breed, yet it may be urged that other wild species have
    been the parents of the other domestic breeds; and that these
    species still exist, though unknown, in some country, or have
    become extinct. The extinction, however, of several species of
    fowls, is an improbable hypothesis, seeing that the four known
    species have not become extinct in the most ancient and thickly
    peopled regions of the East. There is, in fact, not one other kind
    of domesticated bird, of which the wild parent-form is unknown,
    that is become extinct. For the discovery of new, or the
    rediscovery of old species of Gallus, we must not look, as fanciers
    often look, to the whole world. The larger gallinaceous birds, as
    Mr. Blyth has remarked,<A href="#refer"><SUP>26</SUP></A> generally
    have a restricted range: we see this well illustrated in India,
    where the genus Gallus inhabits the base of the Himalaya, and is
    succeeded higher up by Gallophasis, and still higher up by
    Phasianus. Australia, with its islands, is out of the question as
    the home for unknown species of the genus. It is, also, as
    improbable that Gallus should inhabit South America<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>27</SUP></A> as that a humming-bird should be found
    in the Old World. From the character of the other gallinaceous
    birds of Africa, it is not probable that Gallus is an African
    genus. We need not look to the western parts of Asia, for Messrs.
    Blyth and Crawfurd, who have attended to this subject, doubt
    whether Gallus ever existed in a wild state even as far west as
    Persia. Although the earliest Greek writers speak of the fowl as a
    Persian bird, this probably merely indicates its line of
    importation. For the discovery of unknown species we must look to
    India, to the Indo-Chinese countries, and to the northern parts of
    the Malay Archipelago. The southern portion of China is the most
    likely country; but as Mr. Blyth informs me, skins have been
    exported from China during a long period, and living birds are
    largely kept there in aviaries, so that any native species of
    Gallus would probably have become known. Mr. Birch, of the British
    Museum, has translated for me passages from a Chinese
    Encyclop&#230;dia published in 1609, but compiled from more ancient
    documents, in which it is said that fowls are creatures of the
    West, and were introduced into the East (<I>i.e.</I> China) in a
    dynasty 1400 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL> Whatever may be thought of so
    ancient a date, we see that the Indo-Chinese and Indian regions
    were formerly considered by the Chinese as the source of the
    domestic fowl. From these several considerations we must look to
    the present metropolis of the genus, namely, to the south-eastern
    parts of Asia, for the discovery of species which were formerly
    domesticated, but are now unknown in the wild state; and the most
    experienced ornithologists do not consider it probable that such
    species will be discovered.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> In considering whether the domestic breeds are
    descended from one species, namely, <I>G. bankiva,</I> or from
    several, we must not quite overlook, though we must not exaggerate,
    the importance of the test of fertility. Most of our domestic
    breeds have been so often crossed, and their mongrels so largely
    kept, that it is almost certain, if any degree of infertility had
    existed between them, it would have been detected. On the other
    hand, the four known species of Gallus when crossed with each
    other, or when crossed, with the exception of <I>G. bankiva,</I>
    with the domestic fowl, produce infertile hybrids.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Finally, we have not such good evidence with
    fowls as with pigeons, of all the breeds having descended from a
    single primitive stock. In both cases the argument of fertility
    must go for something; in both we have the improbability of man
    having succeeded in ancient times in thoroughly domesticating
    several supposed species,&#8212;most of these supposed species
    being extremely abnormal as compared with their natural
    allies,&#8212;all being now either unknown or extinct, though the
    parent-form of no other domesticated bird has been lost. But in
    searching for the supposed parent-stocks of the various breeds of
    the pigeon, we were enabled to confine our search to species having
    peculiar habits of life; whilst with fowls there is nothing in
    their habits in any marked manner distinct from those of other
    gallinaceous birds. In the case of pigeons, I have shown that
    purely-bred birds of every race and the crossed offspring of
    distinct races frequently resemble, or revert to, the wild
    rock-pigeon in general colour and in each characteristic mark. With
    fowls we have facts of a similar nature, but less strongly
    pronounced, which we will now discuss.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> <I>Reversion and Analogous
    Variation.</I>&#8212;Purely-bred Game, Malay, Cochin, Dorking,
    Bantam, and, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, Silk fowls, may
    frequently or occasionally be met with, which are almost identical
    in plumage with the wild <I>G. bankiva.</I> This is a fact well
    deserving attention, when we reflect that these breeds rank amongst
    the most distinct. Fowls thus coloured are called by amateurs
    black-breasted reds. Hamburghs properly have a very different
    plumage; nevertheless, as Mr. Tegetmeier informs me, "the great
    difficulty in breeding cocks of the golden-spangled variety is
    their tendency to have black breasts and red backs. The males of
    white Bantams and white Cochins, as they come to maturity, often
    assume a yellowish or saffron tinge; and the longer neck hackles of
    black Bantam cocks,"<A href="#refer"><SUP>28</SUP></A> when two or
    three years old, not uncommonly become ruddy; these latter Bantams
    occasionally "even moult brassy-winged, or actually
    red-shouldered." So that in these several cases we see a plain
    tendency to reversion to the hues of <I>G. bankiva,</I> even during
    the lifetime of the individual bird. With Spanish, Polish,
    pencilled Hamburgh, silver-spangled Hamburgh fowls, and with some
    other less common breeds, I have never heard of a black-breasted
    red bird having appeared.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> From my experience with pigeons, I made the
    following crosses. I first killed all my own poultry, no others
    living near my house, and then procured, by Mr. Tegetmeier's
    assistance, a first-rate black Spanish cock, and hens of the
    following pure breeds,&#8212;white Game, white Cochin,
    silver-spangled Polish, silver-spangled Hamburgh, silver-pencilled
    Hamburgh, and white Silk. In none of these breeds is there a trace
    of red, nor when kept pure have I ever heard of the appearance of a
    red feather; though such an occurrence would perhaps not be very
    improbable with white Games and white Cochins. Of the many chickens
    reared from the above six crosses the majority were black, both in
    the down and in the first plumage; some were white, and a very few
    were mottled black and white. In one lot of eleven mixed eggs from
    the white Game and white Cochin by the black Spanish cock, seven of
    the chickens were white, and only four black. I mention this fact
    to show that whiteness of plumage is strongly inherited, and that
    the belief in the prepotent power in the male to transmit his
    colour is not always correct. The chickens were hatched in the
    spring, and in the latter part of August several of the young cocks
    began to exhibit a change, which with some of them increased during
    the following years. Thus a young male bird from the
    silver-spangled Polish hen was in its first plumage coal-black, and
    combined in its comb, crest, wattle, and beard, the characters of
    both parents; but when two years old the secondary wing-feathers
    became largely and symmetrically marked with white, and, wherever
    in <I>G. bankiva</I> the hackles are red, they were in this bird
    greenish-black along the shaft, narrowly bordered with
    brownish-black, and this again broadly bordered with very pale
    yellowish-brown; so that in general appearance the plumage had
    become pale-coloured instead of black. In this case, with advancing
    age there was a great change, but no reversion to the red colour of
    <I>G. bankiva.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> A cock with a regular rose comb derived either
    from the spangled or pencilled silver Hamburgh was likewise at
    first quite black; but in less than a year the neck-hackles, as in
    the last case, became whitish, whilst those on the loins assumed a
    decided reddish-yellow tint; and here we see the first symptom of
    reversion; this likewise occurred with some other young cocks,
    which need not here be described. It has also been recorded<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>29</SUP></A> by a breeder, that he crossed two
    silver-pencilled Hamburgh hens with a Spanish cock, and reared a
    number of chickens, all of which were black, the cocks having <I>
    golden</I> and the hens brownish hackles; so that in this instance
    likewise there was a clear tendency to reversion.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Two young cocks from my white Game hen were at
    first snow white; of these, one subsequently assumed male
    orange-coloured hackles, chiefly on the loins, and the other an
    abundance of fine orange-red hackles on the neck, loins, and upper
    wing-coverts. Here again we have a more decided, though partial,
    reversion to the colours of <I>G. bankiva.</I> This second cock was
    in fact coloured like an inferior "pile Came cock;"&#8212;now this
    sub-breed can be produced, as I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier, by
    crossing a black-breasted red Game cock with a white Game hen, and
    the "pile" sub-breed thus produced can afterwards be truly
    propagated. So that we have the curious fact of the glossy-black
    Spanish cock and the black-breasted red Game cock when crossed with
    white Game hens producing offspring of nearly the same colours.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> I reared several birds from the white Silk hen
    by the Spanish cock: all were coal-black, and all plainly showed
    their parentage in having blackish combs and bones; none inherited
    the so-called silky feathers, and the non-inheritance of this
    character has been observed by others. The hens never varied in
    their plumage. As the young cocks grew old, one of them assumed
    yellowish-white hackles, and thus resembled in a considerable
    degree the cross from the Hamburgh hen; the other became a gorgeous
    bird, so much so that an acquaintance had it preserved and stuffed
    simply from its beauty. When stalking about it closely resembled
    the wild <I>Gallus bankiva,</I> but with the red feathers rather
    darker. On close comparison one considerable difference presented
    itself, namely, that the primary and secondary wing-feathers were
    edged with greenish-black, instead of being edged, as in <I>G.
    bankiva,</I> with fulvous and red tints. The space, also, across
    the back, which bears dark-green feathers, was broader, and the
    comb was blackish. In all other respects, even in trifling details
    of plumage, there was the closest accordance. Altogether it was a
    marvellous sight to compare this bird first with <I>G. bankiva,</I>
    and then with its father, the glossy green-black Spanish cock, and
    with its diminutive mother, the white Silk hen. This case of
    reversion is the more extraordinary as the Spanish breed has long
    been known to breed true, and no instance is on record of its
    throwing a single red feather. The Silk hen likewise breeds true,
    and is believed to be ancient, for Aldrovandi, before 1600, alludes
    probably to this breed, and described it as covered with wool. It
    is so peculiar in many characters that some writers have considered
    it as specifically distinct; yet, as we now see, when crossed with
    the Spanish fowl, it yields offspring closely resembling the wild
    <I>G. bankiva.</I></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Mr. Tegetmeier has been so kind as to repeat,
    at my request, the cross between a Spanish cock and Silk hen, and
    he obtained similar results; for he thus raised, besides a black
    hen, seven cocks, all of which were dark-bodied with more or less
    orange-red hackles. In the ensuing year he paired the black hen
    with one of her brothers, and raised three young cocks, all
    coloured like their father, and a black hen mottled with white.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> The hens from the six above-described crosses
    showed hardly any tendency to revert to the mottled-brown plumage
    of the female <I>G. bankiva</I>: one hen, however, from the white
    Cochin, which was at first coal-black, became slightly brown or
    sooty. Several hens, which were for a long time snow-white,
    acquired as they grew old a few black feathers. A hen from the
    white Game, which was for a long time entirely black glossed with
    green, when two years old had some of the primary wing feathers
    greyish-white, and a multitude of feathers over her body narrowly
    and symmetrically tipped or laced with white. I had expected that
    some of the chickens whilst covered with down would have assumed
    the longitudinal stripes so general with gallinaceous birds; but
    this did not occur in a single instance. Two or three alone were
    reddish-brown about their heads. I was unfortunate in losing nearly
    all the white chickens from the first crosses; so that black
    prevailed with the grandchildren; but they were much diversified in
    colour, some being sooty, others mottled, and one blackish chicken
    had its feathers oddly tipped and barred with brown.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> I will here add a few miscellaneous facts
    connected with reversion, and with the law of analogous variation.
    This law implies, as stated in a previous chapter, that the
    varieties of one species frequently mock distinct but allied
    species; and this fact is explained, according to the views which I
    maintain, on the principle of allied species having descended from
    one primitive form. The white Silk fowl with black skin and bones
    degenerates, as has been observed by Mr. Hewitt and Mr. R. Orton,
    in our climate; that is, it reverts to the ordinary colour of the
    common fowl in its skin and bones, due care having been taken to
    prevent any cross. In Germany<A href="#refer"><SUP>30</SUP></A> a
    distinct breed with black bones, and with black, not silky plumage,
    has likewise been observed to degenerate.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that, when distinct
    breeds are crossed, fowls are frequently produced with their
    feathers marked or pencilled by narrow transverse lines of a darker
    colour. This may be in part explained by direct reversion to the
    parent-form, the Bankiva hen; for this bird has all its upper
    plumage finely mottled with dark and rufous brown, with the
    mottling partially and obscurely arranged in transverse lines. But
    the tendency to pencilling is probably much strengthened by the law
    of analogous variation, for the hens of some other species of
    Gallus are more plainly pencilled, and the hens of many
    gallinaceous birds belonging to other genera, as the partridge,
    have pencilled feathers. Mr. Tegetmeier has also remarked to me
    that, although with domestic pigeons we have so great a diversity
    of colouring, we never see either pencilled or spangled feathers;
    and this fact is intelligible on the law of analogous variation, as
    neither the wild rock pigeon nor any closely allied species has
    such feathers. The frequent appearance of pencilling in crossed
    birds probably accounts for the existence of "cuckoo" sub-breeds in
    the Game, Polish, Dorking, Cochin, Andalusian, and Bantam breeds.
    The plumage of these birds is slaty-blue or grey, with each feather
    transversely barred with darker lines, so as to resemble in some
    degree the plumage of the cuckoo. It is a singular fact,
    considering that the male of no species of Gallus is in the least
    barred, that the cuckoo-like plumage has often been transferred to
    the male, more especially in the cuckoo Dorking; and the fact is
    all the more singular, as in gold- and silver-pencilled Hamburghs,
    in which pencilling is characteristic of the breed, the male is
    hardly at all pencilled, this kind of plumage being confined to the
    female.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Another case of analogous variation is the
    occurrence of spangled sub-breeds of Hamburgh, Polish, Malay, and
    Bantam fowls. Spangled feathers have a dark mark, properly
    crescent-shaped, on their tips; whilst pencilled feathers have
    several transverse bars. The spangling cannot be due to reversion
    to <I>G. bankiva</I>; nor does it often follow, as I hear from Mr.
    Tegetmeier, from crossing distinct breeds; but it is a case of
    analogous variation, for many gallinaceous birds have spangled
    feathers,&#8212;for instance, the common pheasant. Hence spangled
    breeds are often called "pheasant"-fowls. Another case of analogous
    variation in several domestic breeds is inexplicable; it is, that
    the chickens, whilst covered with down, of the black Spanish, black
    Game, black Polish, and black Bantam, all have white throats and
    breasts, and often have some white on their wings.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>31</SUP></A> The editor of the 'Poultry Chronicle'<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>32</SUP></A> remarks that all the breeds which
    properly have red ear-lappets occasionally produce birds with white
    ear-Tappets. This remark more especially applies to the Game breed,
    which of all comes nearest to the <I>G. bankiva</I>; and we have
    seen that with this species living in a state of nature, the
    ear-lappets vary in colour, being red in the Malayan countries, and
    generally, but not invariably, white in India.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> In concluding this part of my subject, I may
    repeat that there exists one widely-ranging, varying, and common
    species of Gallus, namely, <I>G. bankiva,</I> which can be tamed,
    produces fertile offspring when crossed with common fowls, and
    closely resembles in its whole structure, plumage, and voice the
    Game breed; hence it may be safely ranked as the parent of this,
    the most typical domesticated breed. We have seen that there is
    much difficulty in believing that other, now unknown, species have
    been the parents of the other domestic breeds. We know that all the
    breeds are most closely allied, as shown by their similarity in
    most points of structure and in habits, and by the analogous manner
    in which they vary. We have also seen that several of the most
    distinct breeds occasionally or habitually closely resemble in
    plumage <I>G. bankiva,</I> and that the crossed offspring of other
    breeds, which are not thus coloured, show a stronger or weaker
    tendency to revert to this same plumage. Some of the breeds, which
    appear the most distinct and the least likely to have proceeded
    from <I>G. bankiva,</I> such as Polish fowls, with their
    protuberant and little ossified skulls, and Cochins, with their
    imperfect tail and small wings, bear in these characters the plain
    marks of their artificial origin. We know well that of late years
    methodical selection has greatly improved and fixed many
    characters; and we have every reason to believe that unconscious
    selection, carried on for many generations, will have steadily
    augmented each new peculiarity, and thus have given rise to new
    breeds. As soon as two or three breeds were once formed, crossing
    would come into play in changing their character and in increasing
    their number. Brahma Pootras, according to an account lately
    published in America, offer a good instance of a breed, lately
    formed by a cross, which can be truly propagated. The well-known
    Sebright Bantams offer another and similar instance. Hence it may
    be concluded that not only the Game-breed but that all our breeds
    are probably the descendants of the Malayan or Indian variety of
    <I>G. bankiva.</I> If so, this species has varied greatly since it
    was first domesticated; but there has been ample time, as we shall
    now show.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> <I>History of the
    Fowl.</I>&#8212;R&#252;timeyer found no remains of the fowl in the
    ancient Swiss lake-dwellings; but, according to Jeitteles,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>33</SUP></A> such have certainly since been found
    associated with extinct animals and prehistoric remains. It is,
    therefore a strange fact that the fowl is not mentioned in the Old
    Testament, nor figured on the ancient Egyptian monuments. It is not
    referred to by Homer or Hesiod (about 900 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>); but
    is mentioned by Theognis and Aristophanes between 400 and 500
    <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL> It is figured on some of the Babylonian
    cylinders, between the sixth and seventh centuries <SMALL>
    B.C.</SMALL>, of which Mr. Layard sent me an impression; and on the
    Harpy Tomb in Lycia, about 600 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>: so that the
    fowl apparently reached Europe in a domesticated condition
    somewhere about the sixth century <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL> It had
    travelled still farther westward by the time of the Christian era,
    for it was found in Britain by Julius C&#230;sar. In India it must
    have been domesticated when the Institutes of Manu were written,
    that is, according to Sir W. Jones, 1200 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL>, but,
    according to the later authority of Mr. H. Wilson, only 800 <SMALL>
    B.C.</SMALL>, for the domestic fowl is forbidden, whilst the wild
    is permitted to be eaten. If, as before remarked, we may trust the
    old Chinese Encyclop&#230;dia, the fowl must have been domesticated
    several centuries earlier, as it is said to have been introduced
    from the West into China 1400 <SMALL>B.C.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Sufficient materials do not exist for tracing
    the history of the separate breeds. About the commencement of the
    Christian era, Columella mentions a five-toed fighting breed, and
    some provincial breeds; but we know nothing about them. He also
    alludes to dwarf fowls; but these cannot have been the same with
    our Bantams, which, as Mr. Crawfurd has shown, were imported from
    Japan into Bantam in Java. A dwarf fowl, probably the true Bantam,
    is referred to in an old Japanese Encyclop&#230;dia, as I am
    informed by Mr. Birch. In the Chinese Encyclop&#230;dia published
    in 1596, but compiled from various sources, some of high antiquity,
    seven breeds are mentioned, including what we should now call
    Jumpers or Creepers, and likewise fowls with black feathers, bones,
    and flesh. In 1600 Aldrovandi describes seven or eight breeds of
    fowls, and this is the most ancient record from which the age of
    our European breeds can be inferred. The <I>Gallus turcicus</I>
    certainly seems to be a pencilled Hamburgh; but Mr. Brent, a most
    capable judge, thinks that Aldrovandi "evidently figured what he
    happened to see, and not the best of the breed." Mr. Brent, indeed,
    considers all Aldrovandi's fowls as of impure breed; but it is a
    far more probable view that all our breeds have been much improved
    and modified since his time; for, as he went to the expense of so
    many figures, he probably would have secured characteristic
    specimens. The Silk fowl, however, probably then existed in its
    present state, as did almost certainly the fowl with frizzled or
    reversed feathers. Mr. Dixon<A href="#refer"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
    considers Aldrovandi's Paduan fowl as "a variety of the Polish,"
    whereas Mr. Brent believes it to have been more nearly allied to
    the Malay. The anatomical peculiarities of the skull of the Polish
    breed were noticed by P. Borelli in 1656. I may add that in 1737
    one Polish sub-breed, viz., the Golden-spangled, was known; but
    judging from Albin's description, the comb was then larger, the
    crest of feathers much smaller, the breast more coarsely spotted,
    and the stomach and thighs much blacker: a Golden-spangled Polish
    fowl in this condition would now be of no value.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> <I>Differences in External and Internal
    Structure between the Breeds: Individual
    Variability.</I>&#8212;Fowls have been exposed to diversified
    conditions of life, and as we have just seen there has been ample
    time for much variability and for the slow action of unconscious
    selection. As there are good grounds for believing that all the
    breeds are descended from Gallus bankiva, it will be worth while to
    describe in some detail the chief points of difference. Beginning
    with the eggs and chickens, I will pass on to their secondary
    sexual characters, and then to their differences in external
    structure and in the skeleton. I enter on the following details
    chiefly to show how variable almost every character has become
    under domestication.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> <I>Eggs.</I>&#8212;Mr. Dixon remarks<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>35</SUP></A> that "to every hen belongs an
    individual peculiarity in the form, colour, and size of her egg,
    which never changes during her life-time, so long as she remains in
    health, and which is as well known to those who are in the habit of
    taking her produce, as the hand-writing of their nearest
    acquaintance." I believe that this is generally true, and that, if
    no great number of hens be kept, the eggs of each can almost always
    be recognised. The eggs of differently sized breeds naturally
    differ much in size; but apparently, not always in strict relation
    to the size of the hen: thus the Malay is a larger bird than the
    Spanish, but  she produces not such large eggs; white Bantams are
    said to lay smaller eggs than other Bantams;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>36</SUP></A> white Cochins, on the other hand, as I
    hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, certainly lay larger eggs than buff
    Cochins. The eggs, however, of the different breeds vary
    considerably in character; for instance, Mr. Ballance states<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>37</SUP></A> that his Malay "pullets of last
    year laid eggs equal in size to those of any duck, and other Malay
    hens, two or three years old, laid eggs very little larger than a
    good sized Bantam's egg. Some were as white as a Spanish hen's egg,
    and others varied from a light cream-colour to a deep rich buff, or
    even to a brown." The shape also varies, the two ends being much
    more equally rounded in Cochins than in Games or Polish. Spanish
    fowls lay smoother eggs than Cochins, of which the eggs are
    generally granulated. The shell in this latter breed, and more
    especially in Malays is apt to be thicker than in Games or Spanish;
    but the Minorcas, a sub-breed of Spanish, are said to lay harder
    eggs than true Spanish.<A href="#refer"><SUP>38</SUP></A> The
    colour differs considerably,&#8212;the Cochins laying buff-coloured
    eggs; the Malays a paler variable buff; and Games a still paler
    buff. It would appear that darker-coloured eggs characterise the
    breeds which have lately come from the East, or are still closely
    allied to those now living there. The colour of the yolk, according
    to Ferguson, as well as of the shell, differs slightly in the
    sub-breeds of the Game. I am also informed by Mr. Brent that dark
    partridge-coloured Cochin hens lay darker coloured eggs than the
    other Cochin sub-breeds. The flavour and richness of the egg
    certainly differ in different breeds. The productiveness of the
    several breeds is very different. Spanish, Polish, and Hamburgh
    hens have lost the incubating instinct.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> <I>Chickens.</I>&#8212;As the young of
    almost all gallinaceous birds, even of the black curassow and black
    grouse, whilst covered with down, are longitudinally striped on the
    back,&#8212;of which character, when adult, neither sex retains a
    trace,&#8212;it might have been expected that the chickens of all
    our domestic fowls would have been similarly striped.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>39</SUP></A> This could, however, hardly have been
    expected, when the adult plumage in both sexes has undergone so
    great a change as to be wholly white or black. In white fowls of
    various breeds the chickens are uniformly yellowish white, passing
    in the black-boned Silk fowl into bright canary-yellow. This is
    also generally the case with the chickens of white Cochins, but I
    hear from Mr. Zurhost that they are sometimes of a buff or oak
    colour, and that all those of this latter colour, which were
    watched, turned out males. The chickens of buff Cochins are of a
    golden-yellow, easily distinguishable from the paler tint of the
    white Cochins, and are often longitudinally streaked with dark
    shades: the chickens of silver-cinnamon Cochins are almost always
    of a buff colour. The chickens of the white Game and white Dorking
    breeds, when held in particular lights, sometimes exhibit (on the
    authority of Mr. Brent) faint traces of longitudinal stripes. Fowls
    which are entirely black, namely, Spanish, black Game, black
    Polish, and black Bantams, display a new character, for their
    chickens have their breasts and throats more or less white, with
    sometimes a little white elsewhere. Spanish chickens also,
    occasionally (Brent), have, where the down was white, their first
    true feathers tipped for a time with white. The primordially
    striped character is retained by the chickens of most of the Game
    sub-breeds (Brent, Dixon); by Dorkings; by the partridge and
    grouse-coloured sub-breeds of Cochins (Brent), but not, as we have
    seen, by the sub-breeds; by the pheasant-Malay (Dixon), but
    apparently not (at which I am much surprised) by other Malays. The
    following breeds and sub-breeds are barely, or not at all,
    longitudinally striped: viz., gold and silver pencilled Hamburghs,
    which can hardly be distinguished from each other (Brent) in the
    down, both having a few dark spots on the head and rump, with
    occasionally a longitudinal stripe (Dixon) on the back of the neck.
    I have seen only one chicken of the silver-spangled Hamburgh, and
    this was obscurely striped along the back. Gold-spangled Polish
    chickens (Tegetmeier) are of a warm russet brown; and
    silver-spangled Polish chickens are grey, sometimes (Dixon) with
    dashes of ochre on the head, wings, and breast. Cuckoo and blue-dun
    fowls (Dixon) are grey in the down. The chickens of Sebright
    Bantams (Dixon) are uniformly dark brown, whilst those of the
    brown-breasted red Game Bantam are black, with some white on the
    throat and breast. From these facts we see that young chickens of
    the different breeds, and even of the same main breed, differ much
    in their downy plumage; and, although longitudinal stripes
    characterise the young of all wild gallinaceous birds, they
    disappear in several domestic breeds. Perhaps it may be accepted as
    a general rule that the more the adult plumage differs from that of
    the adult <I>G. bankiva,</I> the more completely the chickens have
    lost their stripes.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> With respect to the period of life at which the
    characters proper to each breed first appear, it is obvious that
    such structures as additional toes must be formed long before
    birth. In Polish fowls, the extraordinary protuberance of the
    anterior part of the skull is well developed before the chickens
    come out of the egg;<A href="#refer"><SUP>40</SUP></A> but the
    crest, which is supported on the protuberance, is at first feebly
    developed, nor does it attain its full size until the second year.
    The Spanish cock is pre-eminent for his magnificent comb, and this
    is developed at an unusually early age; so that the young males can
    be distinguished from the females when only a few weeks old, and
    therefore earlier than in other breeds; they likewise crow very
    early, namely, when about six weeks old. In the Dutch sub-breed of
    the Spanish fowl the white ear-lappets are developed earlier than
    in the common Spanish breed.<A href="#refer"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
    Cochins are characterised by a small tail, and in the young cocks
    the tail is developed at an unusually late period.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>42</SUP></A> Game fowls are notorious for their
    pugnacity; and the young cocks crow, clap their little wings, and
    fight obstinately with each other, even whilst under their mother's
    care.<A href="#refer"><SUP>43</SUP></A> "I have often had," says
    one author,<A href="#refer"><SUP>44</SUP></A> "whole broods,
    scarcely feathered, stone-blind from fighting; the rival couples
    moping in corners, and renewing their battles on obtaining the
    first ray of light." The weapons and pugnacity of all male
    gallinaceous birds evidently serve the purpose of gaining
    possession of the females; so that the tendency in our Game
    chickens to fight at an extremely early age is not only useless,
    but injurious, as they suffer much from their wounds. The training
    for battle during an early age may be natural to the wild Gallus
    bankiva; but as man during many generations has gone on selecting
    the most obstinately pugnacious cocks, it is more probable that
    their pugnacity has been unnaturally increased, and unnaturally
    transferred to the young male chickens. In the same manner, it is
    probable that the extraordinary development of the comb in the
    Spanish cock has been unintentionally transferred to the young
    cocks; for fanciers would not care whether their young birds had
    large combs, but would select for breeding the adults which had the
    finest combs, whether or not developed at an early period. The last
    point which need here be noticed is that, though the chickens of
    Spanish and Malay fowls are well covered with down, the true
    feathers are acquired at an unusually late age; so that for a time
    the young birds are partially naked, and are liable to suffer from
    cold.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> <I>Secondary Sexual Characters.</I>&#8212;The
    two sexes in the parent-form, the <I>Gallus bankiva,</I> differ
    much in colour. In our domestic breeds the difference is never
    greater, but is often less, and varies much in degree even in the
    sub-breeds of the same main breed. Thus in certain Game fowls the
    difference is as great as in the parent-form, whilst in the black
    and white sub-breeds there is no difference in plumage. Mr. Brent
    informs me that he has seen two strains of black-breasted red
    Games, of which the cocks could not be distinguished, whilst the
    hens in one were partridge-brown and in the other fawn-brown. A
    similar case has been observed in the strains of the brown-breasted
    red Game. The hen of the "duck-winged Game" is "extremely
    beautiful," and differs much from the hens of all the other Game
    sub-breeds; but generally, as with the blue and grey Game and with
    some sub-varieties of the pile-game, a moderately close relation
    may be observed between the males and females in the variation of
    their plumage.<A href="#refer"><SUP>45</SUP></A> A similar relation
    is also evident when we compare the several varieties of Cochins.
    In the two sexes of gold and silver-spangled and of buff Polish
    fowls, there is much general similarity in the colouring and marks
    of the whole plumage, excepting of course in the hackles, crest,
    and beard. In spangled Hamburghs, there is likewise a considerable
    degree of similarity between the two sexes. In pencilled Hamburghs,
    on the other hand, there is much dissimilarity; the pencilling
    which is characteristic of the hens being almost absent in the
    males of both the golden and silver varieties. But, as we have
    already seen, it cannot be given as a general rule that male fowls
    never have pencilled feathers, for Cuckoo Dorkings are "remarkable
    from having nearly similar markings in both sexes."</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> It is a singular fact that the males in certain
    sub-breeds have lost some of their secondary masculine characters,
    and from their close resemblance in plumage to the females, are
    often called hennies. There is much diversity of opinion whether
    these males are in any degree sterile; that they sometimes are
    partially sterile seems clear,<A href="#refer"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
    but this may have been caused by too close interbreeding. That they
    are not quite sterile, and that the whole case is widely different
    from that of old females assuming masculine characters, is evident
    from several of these hen-like sub-breeds having been long
    propagated. The males and females of gold and silver-laced Sebright
    Bantams can be barely distinguished from each other, except by
    their combs, wattles, and spurs, for they are coloured alike, and
    the males have not hackles, nor the flowing sickle-like
    tail-feathers. A hen-tailed sub-breed of Hamburghs was recently
    much esteemed. There is also a breed of Game-fowls, in which the
    males and females resemble each other so closely that the cocks
    have often mistaken their hen-feathered opponents in the cock-pit
    for real hens, and by the mistake have lost their lives.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>47</SUP></A> The cocks, though dressed in the
    feathers of the hen, "are high-spirited birds, and their courage
    has been often proved:" an engraving even has been published of one
    celebrated hen-tailed victor. Mr. Tegetmeier<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>48</SUP></A> has recorded the remarkable case of a
    brown-breasted red Game cock which, after assuming its perfect
    masculine plumage, became hen-feathered in the autumn of the
    following year; but he did not lose voice, spurs, strength, nor
    productiveness. This bird has now retained the same character
    during five seasons, and has begot both hen-feathered and
    male-feathered offspring. Mr. Grantley F. Berkeley relates the
    still more singular case of a celebrated strain of "polecat Game
    fowls," which produced in nearly every brood a single hen-cock.
    "The great peculiarity in one of these birds was that he, as the
    seasons succeeded each other, was not always a hen-cock, and not
    always of the colour called the polecat, which is black. From the
    polecat and hen-cock feather in one season he moulted to a full
    male-plumaged black-breasted red, and in the following year he
    returned to the former feather."<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>49</SUP></A></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> I have remarked in my 'Origin of Species' that
    secondary sexual characters are apt to differ much in the species
    of the same genus, and to be unusually variable in the individuals
    of the same species. So it is with the breeds of the fowl, as we
    have already seen, as far as the colour of plumage is concerned,
    and so it is with the other secondary sexual characters. Firstly,
    the comb differs much in the various breeds,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>50</SUP></A> and its form is eminently characteristic
    of each kind, with the exception of the Dorkings, in which the form
    has not been as yet determined on by fanciers, and fixed by
    selection. A single, deeply-serrated comb is the typical and most
    common form. It differs much in size, being immensely developed in
    Spanish fowls; and in a local breed called Red-caps, it is
    sometimes "upwards of three inches in breadth at the front, and
    more than four inches in length, measured to the end of the peak
    behind."<A href="#refer"><SUP>51</SUP></A> In some breeds the comb
    is double, and when the two ends are cemented together it forms a
    "cup-comb;" in the "rose-comb" it is depressed, covered with small
    projections, and produced backwards; in the horned and creve-coeur
    fowl it is produced into two horns; it is triple in the pea-combed
    Brahmas, short and truncated in the Malays, and absent in the
    Guelderlands. In the tasselled Game a few long feathers rise from
    the back of the comb: in many breeds a crest of feathers replaces
    the comb. The crest, when little developed, arises from a fleshy
    mass, but, when much developed, from a hemispherical protuberance
    of the skull. In the best Polish fowls it is so largely developed,
    that I have seen birds which could hardly pick up their food; and a
    German writer asserts<A href="#refer"><SUP>52</SUP></A> that they
    are in consequence liable to be struck by hawks. Monstrous
    structures of this kind would thus be suppressed in a state of
    nature. The wattles, also, vary much in size, being small in Malays
    and some other breeds; in certain Polish sub-breeds they are
    replaced by a great tuft of feathers called a beard.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> The hackles do not differ much in the various
    breeds, but are short and stiff in Malays, and absent in Hennies.
    As in some orders male birds display extraordinarily-shaped
    feathers, such as naked shafts with discs at the end, etc., the
    following case may be worth giving. In the wild <I>Gallus
    bankiva</I> and in our domestic fowls, the barbs which arise from
    each side of the extremities of the hackles are naked or not
    clothed with barbules, so that they resemble bristles; but Mr.
    Brent sent me some scapular hackles from a young Birchen Duckwing
    Game cock, in which the naked barbs became densely re-clothed with
    barbules towards their tips; so that these tips, which were dark
    coloured with a metallic lustre, were separated from the lower
    parts by a symmetrically-shaped transparent zone formed of the
    naked portions of the barbs. Hence the coloured tips appeared like
    little separate metallic discs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> The sickle-feathers in the tail, of which there
    are three pair, and which are eminently characteristic of the male
    sex, differ much in the various breeds. They are scimitar-shaped in
    some Hamburghs, instead of being long and flowing as in the typical
    breeds. They are extremely short in Cochins, and are not at all
    developed in Hennies. They are carried, together with the whole
    tail, erect in Dorkings and Gaines; but droop much in Malays and in
    some Cochins. Sultans are characterised by an additional number of
    lateral sickle-feathers. The spurs vary much, being placed higher
    or lower on the shank; being extremely long and sharp in Games, and
    blunt and short in Cochins. These latter birds seem aware that
    their spurs are not efficient weapons; for though they occasionally
    use them, they more frequently fight, as I am informed by Mr.
    Tegetmeier, by seizing and shaking each other with their beaks. In
    some Indian Game cocks, received by Mr. Brent from Germany, there
    are, as he informs me, three, four, or even five spurs on each leg.
    Some Dorkings also have two spurs on each leg;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>53</SUP></A> and in birds of this breed the spur is
    often placed almost on the outside of the leg. Double spurs are
    mentioned in an ancient Chinese Encyclop&#230;dia. Their occurrence
    may be considered as a case of analogous variation, for some wild
    gallinaceous birds, for instance, the Polyplectron, have double
    spurs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Judging from the differences which generally
    distinguish the sexes in the Gallinace&#230;, certain characters in
    our domestic fowls appear to have been transferred from the one sex
    to the other. In all the species (except in Turnix), when there is
    any conspicuous difference in plumage between the male and female,
    the male is always the most beautiful; but in golden-spangled
    Hamburghs the hen is equally beautiful with the cock, and
    incomparably more beautiful than the hen in any natural species of
    Gallus; so that here a masculine character has been transferred to
    the female. On the other hand, in Cuckoo Dorkings and in other
    cuckoo breeds the pencilling, which in Gallus is a female
    attribute, has been transferred to the male: nor, on the principle
    of analogous variation, is this transference surprising, as the
    males in many gallinaceous genera are barred or pencilled. With
    most of these birds head ornaments of all kinds are more fully
    developed in the male than in the female; but in Polish fowls the
    crest or top-knot, which in the male replaces the comb, is equally
    developed in both sexes. In the males of certain other sub-breeds,
    which from the hen having a small crest, are called lark-crested,
    "a single upright comb sometimes almost entirely takes the place of
    the crest."<A href="#refer"><SUP>54</SUP></A> From this latter
    case, and more especially from some facts presently to be given
    with respect to the protuberance of the skull in Polish fowls, the
    crest in this breed must be viewed as a feminine character which
    has been transferred to the male. In the Spanish breed the male, as
    we know, has an immense comb, and this has been partially
    transferred to the female, for her comb is unusually large, though
    not upright. In Game fowls the bold and savage disposition of the
    male has likewise been largely transferred to the female;<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>55</SUP></A> and she sometimes even possesses the
    eminently masculine character of spurs. Many cases are on record of
    fertile hens being furnished with spurs; and in Germany, according
    to Bechstein,<A href="#refer"><SUP>56</SUP></A> the spurs in the
    Silk hen are sometimes very long. He mentions also another breed
    similarly characterised, in which the hens are excellent layers,
    but are apt to disturb and break their eggs owing to their
    spurs.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Mr. Layard<A href="#refer"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
    has given an account of a breed of fowls in Ceylon with black skin,
    bones, and wattle, but with ordinary feathers, and which cannot "be
    more aptly described than by comparing them to a white fowl drawn
    down a sooty chimney; it is, however," adds Mr. Layard, "a
    remarkable fact that a male bird of the pure sooty variety is
    almost as rare as a tortoise-shell tom-cat." Mr. Blyth found the
    same rule to hold good with this breed near Calcutta. The males and
    females, on the other hand, of the black-boned European breed, with
    silky feathers, do not differ from each other; so that in the one
    breed, black skin and bones and the same kind of plumage are common
    to both sexes, whilst in the other breed, these characters are
    confined to the female sex.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> At the present day all the breeds of Polish
    fowls have the great bony protuberance on their skulls, which
    includes part of the brain and supports the crest, equally
    developed in both sexes. But formerly in Germany the skull of the
    hen alone was protuberant: Blumenbach,<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>58</SUP></A> who particularly attended to abnormal
    peculiarities in domestic animals, states, in 1805, that this was
    the case; and Bechstein had previously, in 1793 observed the same
    fact. This latter author has carefully described the effects on the
    skull of a crest not only in the case of fowls, but of ducks,
    geese, and canaries. He states that with fowls, when the crest is
    not much developed, it is supported on a fatty mass; but when much
    developed, it is always supported on a bony protuberance of
    variable size. He well describes the peculiarities of this
    protuberance; he attended also to the effects of the modified shape
    of the brain on the intellect of these birds, and disputes Pallas'
    statement that they are stupid. He then expressly remarks that he
    never observed this protuberance in male fowls. Hence there can be
    no doubt that this extraordinary character in the skulls of Polish
    fowls was formerly in Germany confined to the female sex, but has
    now been transferred to the males, and has thus become common to
    both sexes.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The size of the body differs greatly.
    Mr. Tegetmeier has known a Brahma to weigh 17 pounds; a fine Malay
    cock 10 pounds; whilst a first-rate Sebright Bantam weighs hardly
    more than 1 pound. During the last 20 years the size of some of our
    breeds has been largely increased by methodical selection, whilst
    that of other breeds has been much diminished. We have already seen
    how greatly colour varies even within the same breed; we know that
    the wild <I>G. bankiva</I> varies slightly in colour; we know that
    colour is variable in all our domestic animals; nevertheless some
    eminent fanciers have so little faith in variability, that they
    have actually argued that the chief Game sub-breeds, which differ
    from each other in nothing but colour, are descended from distinct
    wild species! Crossing often causes strange modification of colour.
    Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that when buff and white Cochins are
    crossed, some of the chickens are almost invariably black.
    According to Mr. Brent, black and white Cochins occasionally
    produce chickens of a slaty-blue tint; and this same tint results,
    as Mr. Tegetmeier tells me, from crossing white Cochins with black
    Spanish fowls, or white Dorkings with black Minorcas.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>59</SUP></A> A good observer<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>60</SUP></A> states that a first-rate silver-spangled
    Hamburgh hen gradually lost the most characteristic qualities of
    the breed, for the black lacing to her feathers disappeared, and
    her legs changed from leaden-blue to white: but what makes the case
    remarkable is, that this tendency ran in the blood for her sister
    changed in a similar but less strongly marked manner; and chickens
    produced from this latter hen were at first almost pure white, "but
    on moulting acquired black colours and some spangled feathers with
    almost obliterated markings;" so that a new variety arose in this
    singular manner. The skin in the different breeds differs much in
    colour, being white in common kinds, yellow in Malays and Cochins,
    and black in Silk fowls; thus mocking, as M. Godron<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>61</SUP></A> remarks the three principal types of
    skin in mankind. The same author adds that, as different kinds of
    fowls living in distant and isolated parts of the world have black
    skin and bones, this colour must have appeared at various times and
    places.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The shape and carriage of the body, and
    the shape of the head differ much. The beak varies slightly in
    length and curvature, but incomparably less than with pigeons. In
    most crested fowls the nostrils offer a remarkable peculiarity in
    being raised with a crescentic outline. The primary wing-feathers
    are short in Cochins; in a male, which must have been more than
    twice as heavy as <I>G. bankiva,</I> these feathers were in both
    birds of the same length. I have counted, with Mr. Tegetmeier's
    aid, the primary wing-feathers in thirteen cocks and hens of
    various breeds; in four of them, namely in two Hamburghs, a Cochin,
    and Game bantam, there were 10, instead of the normal number 9; but
    in counting these feathers I have followed the practice of
    fanciers, and have <I>not</I> included the first minute primary
    feather, barely three-quarters of an inch in length. These feathers
    differ considerably in relative length, the fourth, or the fifth,
    or the sixth, being the longest; with the third either equal to, or
    considerably shorter than the fifth. In wild gallinaceous species
    the relative length and number of the main wing and tail-feathers
    are extremely constant.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The tail differs much in erectness and
    size, being small in Malays and very small in Cochins. In thirteen
    fowls of various breeds which I have examined, five had the normal
    number of 14 feathers, including in this number the two middle
    sickle-feathers; six others (viz., a Caffre cock, Gold-spangled
    Polish cock, Cochin hen, Sultan hen, Game hen and Malay hen had 16;
    and two (an old Cochin cock and Malay hen) had 17 feathers. The
    rumpless fowl has no tail and in one which I possessed there was no
    oil-gland; but this bird though the os coccygis was extremely
    imperfect, had a vestige of a tail with two rather long feathers in
    the position of the outer caudals. This bird came from a family
    where, as I was told, the breed had kept true for twenty years; but
    rumpless fowls often produce chickens with tails.<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>62</SUP></A> An eminent physiologist<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>63</SUP></A> has recently spoken of this breed as a
    distinct species; had he examined the deformed state of the os
    coccyx he would never have come to this conclusion; he was probably
    misled by the statement, which may be found in some works, that
    tailless fowls are wild in Ceylon; but this statement, as I have
    been assured by Mr. Layard and Dr. Kellaert who have so closely
    studied the birds of Ceylon, is utterly false.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The tarsi vary considerably in length,
    being relatively to the femur considerably longer in the Spanish
    and Frizzled, and shorter in the Silk and Bantam breeds, than in
    the wild <I>G. bankiva</I>; but in the latter, as we have seen, the
    tarsi vary in length. The tarsi are often feathered. The feet in
    many breeds are furnished with additional toes. Golden-spangled
    Polish fowls are said<A href="#refer"><SUP>64</SUP></A> to have the
    skin between their toes much developed: Mr. Tegetmeier observed
    this in one bird, but it was not so in one which I examined. Prof.
    Hoffmann has sent me a sketch of the feet of a fowl of the common
    breed at Giessen, with a web extending between the three toes, for
    about a third of their length. In Cochins the middle toe is said<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>65</SUP></A> to be nearly double the length of
    the lateral toes, and therefore much longer than in <I>G.
    bankiva</I> or in other fowls; but this was not the case in two
    which I examined. The nail of the middle toe in this same breed is
    surprisingly broad and flat, but in a variable degree in two birds
    which I examined; of this structure in the nail there is only a
    trace in <I>G. bankiva.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The voice differs slightly, as I am
    informed by Mr. Dixon, in almost every breed. The Malays<A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>66</SUP></A> have a loud, deep, somewhat prolonged
    crow, but with considerable individual difference. Colonel Sykes
    remarks that the domestic Kulm cock in India has not the shrill
    clear pipe of the English bird, and "his scale of notes appears
    more limited." Dr. Hooker was struck with the "prolonged howling
    screech" of the cocks in Sikhim.<A href="#refer"><SUP>67</SUP></A>
    The crow of the Cochin is notoriously and ludicrously different
    from that of the common cock. The disposition of the different
    breeds is widely different, varying from the savage and defiant
    temper of the Game-cock to the extremely peaceable temper of the
    Cochins. The latter, it has been asserted, "graze to a much greater
    extent than any other varieties." The Spanish fowls suffer more
    from frost than other breeds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Before we pass on to the skeleton, the degree
    of distinctness of the several breeds from <I>G. bankiva</I> ought
    to be noticed. Some writers speak of the Spanish as one of the most
    distinct breeds, and so it is in general aspect; but its
    characteristic differences are not important. The Malay appears to
    me more distinct, from its tall stature, small drooping tail with
    more than fourteen tail-feathers, and from its small comb and
    wattles; nevertheless, one Malay sub-breed is coloured almost
    exactly like <I>G. bankiva.</I> Some authors consider the Polish
    fowl as very distinct; but this is a semi-monstrous breed, as shown
    by the protuberant and irregularly perforated skull. The Cochin,
    from its deeply furrowed frontal bones, peculiarly shaped occipital
    foramen, short wing-feathers, short tail containing more than
    fourteen feathers, broad nail to the middle toe, fluffy plumage,
    rough and dark-coloured eggs, and especially from its peculiar
    voice, is probably the most distinct of all the breeds. If any one
    of our breeds has descended from some unknown species, distinct
    from <I>G. bankiva,</I> it is probably the Cochin; but the balance
    of evidence does not favour this view. All the characteristic
    differences of the Cochin breed are more or less variable, and may
    be detected in a greater or lesser degree in other breeds. One
    sub-breed is coloured closely like <I>G. bankiva.</I> The feathered
    legs, often furnished with an additional toe, the wings incapable
    of flight, the extremely quiet disposition, indicate a long course
    of domestication; and these fowls come from China, where we know
    that plants and animals have been tended from a remote period with
    extraordinary care, and where consequently we might expect to find
    profoundly modified domestic races.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> <I>Osteological Differences.</I>&#8212;I have
    examined twenty-seven skeletons and fifty-three skulls of various
    breeds, including three of <I>G. bankiva</I>: nearly half of these
    skulls I owe to the kindness of Mr. Tegetmeier, and three of the
    skeletons to Mr. Eyton.</P>
    <IMG alt="Fig. 33&#8212;Occipital Foramen of the Skulls of Fowls"
    src="../Images/fig33.jpg" width="174" height="237" align="RIGHT">

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The <I>Skull</I> differs greatly in size
    in different breeds, being nearly twice as long in the largest
    Cochins, but not nearly twice as broad, as in Bantams. The bones at
    the base, from the occipital foramen to the anterior end (including
    the quadrates and pterygoids), are absolutely identical in <I>
    shape</I> in all the skulls. So is the lower jaw. In the forehead
    slight differences are often perceptible between the males and
    females, evidently caused by the presence of the comb. In every
    case I take the skull of <I>G. bankiva</I> as the standard of
    comparison. In four Games, in one Malay hen, in an African cock, in
    a Frizzled cock from Madras, in two black-boned Silk hens, no
    differences worth notice occur. In three <I>Spanish</I> cocks, the
    form of the forehead between the orbits differs considerably; in
    one it is considerably depressed, whilst in the two others it is
    rather prominent, with a deep medial furrow; the skull of the hen
    is smooth. In three skulls of <I>Sebright Bantams</I> the crown is
    more globular, and slopes more abruptly to the occiput, than in <I>
    G. bankiva.</I> In a Bantam or Jumper from Burmah these same
    characters are more strongly pronounced, and the supra-occiput is
    more pointed. In a black Bantam the skull is not so globular, and
    the occipital foramen is very large, and has nearly the same
    sub-triangular outline presently to be described in Cochins; and in
    this skull the two ascending branches of the premaxillary are
    overlapped in a singular manner by the processes of the nasal bone,
    but, as I have seen only one specimen, some of these differences
    may be individual. Of Cochins and Brahmas (the latter a crossed
    race approaching closely to Cochins) I have examined seven skulls;
    at the point where the ascending branches of the premaxillary rest
    on the frontal bone the surface is much depressed, and from this
    depression a deep medial furrow extends backwards to a variable
    distance; the edges of this fissure are rather prominent, as is the
    top of the skull behind and over the orbits. These characters are
    less developed in the hens. The pterygoids, and the processes of
    the lower jaw, are broader, relatively to the size of the head,
    than in <I>G. bankiva</I>; and this is likewise the case with
    Dorkings when of large size. The fork of the hyoid bone in Cochins
    is twice as wide as in <I>G. bankiva,</I> whereas the length of the
    other hyoid bones is only as three to two. But the most remarkable
    character is the shape of the occipital foramen: in <I>G.
    bankiva</I> (A) the breadth in a horizontal line exceeds the height
    in a vertical line, and the outline is nearly circular; whereas in
    Cochins (B) the outline is sub-triangular, and the vertical line
    exceeds the horizontal line in length. This same form likewise
    occurs in the black Bantam above referred to, and an approach to it
    may be seen in some Dorkings, and in a slight degree in certain
    other breeds.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Of <I>Dorkings</I> I have examined three
    skulls, one belonging to the white-sub-breed; the one character
    deserving notice is the breadth of the frontal bones, which are
    moderately furrowed in the middle; thus in a skull which was less
    than once and a half the length of that of <I>G. bankiva,</I> the
    breadth between the orbits was exactly double. Of <I>Hamburghs</I>
    I have examined four skulls (male and female) of the pencilled
    sub-breed, and one (male) of the spangled sub-breed; the nasal
    bones stand remarkably wide apart, but in a variable degree;
    consequently narrow membrane-covered spaces are left between the
    tips of the two ascending branches of the pre-maxillary bones,
    which are rather short, and between these branches and the nasal
    bones. The surface of the frontal bone, on which the branches of
    the premaxillary rest, is very little depressed. These
    peculiarities no doubt stand in close relation with the broad,
    flattened rose-comb characteristic of the Hamburgh
    breed.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> I have examined fourteen skulls of <I>
    Polish and other crested breeds.</I> Their differences are
    extraordinary. First for nine skulls of different sub-breeds of
    English Polish fowls. The hemispherical protuberance of the frontal
    bones<A href="#refer"><SUP>68</SUP></A> may be seen in fig. 34, in
    which (B) the skull of a white-crested Polish fowl is shown
    obliquely from above, with the skull (A) of <I>G. bankiva</I> in
    the same position. In fig. 35 longitudinal sections are given of
    the skull of a Polish fowl, and, for comparison, of a Cochin of the
    same size. The protuberance in all Polish fowls occupies the same
    position but differs much in size. In one of my nine specimens it
    was extremely slight. The degree to which the protuberance is
    ossified varies greatly, larger or smaller portions of bone being
    replaced by membrane. In one specimen there was only a single open
    pore; generally, there are many variously shaped open spaces, the
    bone forming an irregular reticulation. A medial, longitudinal,
    arched ribbon of bone is generally retained, but in one specimen
    there was no bone whatever over the whole protuberance, and the
    skull, when cleaned and viewed from above, presented the appearance
    of an open basin. The change in the whole internal form of the
    skull is surprisingly great. The brain is modified in a
    corresponding manner, as is shown in the two longitudinal sections,
    which deserve attentive consideration. The upper and anterior
    cavity of the three into which the skull may be divided, is the one
    which is so greatly modified; it is evidently much larger than in
    the Cochin skull of the same size, and extends much further beyond
    the interorbital septum, but laterally is less deep. This cavity,
    as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, is entirely filled with brain. In
    the skull of the Cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong internal
    ridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity; but
    this ridge is quite absent in the Polish skull here figured. The
    shape of the central cavity is circular in the Polish, and
    lengthened in the Cochin skull. The shape of the posterior cavity,
    together with the position, size, and number of the pores for the
    nerves, differ much in these two skulls. A pit deeply penetrating
    the occipital bone of the Cochin is entirely absent in this Polish
    skull, whilst in another specimen it was well developed. In this
    second specimen the whole internal surface of the posterior cavity
    likewise differs to a certain extent in shape. I made sections of
    two other skulls,&#8212;namely, of a Polish fowl with the
    protuberance singularly little developed, and of a Sultan in which
    it was a little more developed; and when these two skulls were
    placed between the two above figured (fig. 35), a perfect gradation
    in the configuration of each part of the internal surface could be
    traced. In the Polish skull, with a small protuberance, the ridge
    between the anterior and middle cavities was present, but low; and
    in the Sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing
    on a broad raised eminence.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> It may naturally be asked whether these
    remarkable modifications in the form of the brain affect the
    intellect of Polish fowls; some writers have stated that they are
    extremely stupid, but Bechstein and Mr. Tegetmeier have shown that
    this is by no means generally the case. Nevertheless Bechstein<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>69</SUP></A> states that he had a Polish hen
    which "was crazy, and anxiously wandered about all day long." A hen
    in my possession was solitary in her habits, and was often so
    absorbed in reverie that she could be touched; she was also
    deficient in the most singular manner in the faculty of finding her
    way, so that, if she strayed a hundred yards from her
    feeding-place, she was completely lost, and would then obstinately
    try to proceed in a wrong direction. I have received other and
    similar accounts of Polish fowls appearing stupid or
    half-idiotic.<A href="#refer"><SUP>70</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> To return to the skull of Polish fowls.
    The posterior part, viewed externally, differs little from that of
    <I>G. bankiva.</I> In most fowls the posterior-lateral process of
    the frontal bone and the process of the squamosal bone run together
    and are ossified near their extremities: this union of the two
    bones, however, is not constant in any breed; and in eleven out of
    fourteen skulls of crested breeds, these processes were quite
    distinct. These processes, when not united, instead of being
    inclined anteriorly, as in all common breeds, descend at right
    angles to the lower jaw; and in this case the longer axis of the
    bony cavity of the ear is likewise more perpendicular, than in
    other breeds. When the squamosal process is free instead of
    expanding at the tip, it is reduced to an extremely fine and
    pointed style, of variable length. The pterygoid and quadrate bones
    present no differences. The palatine bones are a little more curved
    upwards at their posterior ends. The frontal bones, anteriorly to
    the protuberance, are, as in Dorkings, very broad, but in a
    variable degree. The nasal bones either stand far apart, as in
    Hamburghs, or almost touch each other, and in one instance were
    ossified together. Each nasal bone properly sends out in front two
    long processes of equal lengths, forming a fork; but in all the
    Polish skulls, except one, the inner process was considerably, but
    in a variable degree, shortened and somewhat upturned. In all the
    skulls, except one, the two ascending branches of the premaxillary,
    instead of running up between the processes of the nasal bones and
    resting on the ethmoid bone, are much shortened and terminate in a
    blunt, somewhat upturned point. In those skulls in which the nasal
    bones approach quite close to each other or are ossified together,
    it would be impossible for the ascending branches of the
    premaxillary to reach the ethmoid and frontal bones; hence we see
    that even the relative connection of the bones has been changed.
    Apparently in consequence of the branches of the premaxillary and
    of the inner processes of the nasal bones being somewhat upturned,
    the external orifices of the nostrils are upraised and assume a
    crescentic outline.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> I must still say a few words on some of
    the foreign Crested breeds. The skull of a crested, rumpless, white
    Turkish fowl was very slightly protuberant, and but little
    perforated; the ascending branches of the premaxillary were well
    developed. In another Turkish breed, called Ghoondooks, the skull
    was considerably protuberant and perforated; the ascending branches
    of the premaxillary were so much aborted that they projected only
    1/15th of an inch; and the inner processes of the nasal bone were
    so completely aborted, that the surface where they should have
    projected was quite smooth. Here then we see these two bones
    modified to an extreme degree. Of Sultans (another Turkish breed) I
    examined two skulls; in that of the female the protuberance was
    much larger than in the male. In both skulls the ascending branches
    of the premaxillary were very short, and in both the nasal portion
    of the inner processes of the nasal bones were ossified together.
    These Sultan skulls differed from those of English Polish fowls in
    the frontal bones, anteriorly to the protuberance, not being
    broad.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> The last skull which I need describe is
    a unique one, lent to me by Mr. Tegetmeier: it resembles a Polish
    skull in most of its characters, but has not the great frontal
    protuberance; it has, however, two rounded knobs of a different
    nature, which stand more in front, above the lachrymal bones. These
    curious knobs, into which the brain does not enter, are separated
    from each other by a deep medial furrow; and this is perforated by
    a few minute pores. The nasal bones stand rather wide apart, with
    their inner processes, and the ascending branches of the
    premaxillary, upturned and shortened. The two knobs no doubt
    supported the two great horn-like projections of the
    comb.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> From the foregoing facts we see in how
    astonishing a manner some of the bones of the skull vary in Crested
    fowls. The protuberance may certainly be called in one sense a
    monstrosity, as being wholly unlike anything observed in nature:
    but as in ordinary cases it is not injurious to the bird, and as it
    is strictly inherited, it can hardly in another sense be called a
    monstrosity. A series may be formed commencing with the black-boned
    Silk fowl, which has a very small crest with the skull beneath
    penetrated only by a few minute orifices, but with no other change
    in its structure; and from this first stage we may proceed to fowls
    with a moderately large crest, which rests, according to Bechstein,
    on a fleshy mass, but without any protuberance in the skull. I may
    add that I have seen a similar fleshy or fibrous mass beneath the
    tuft of feathers on the head of the Tufted duck; and in this case
    there was no actual protuberance in the skull, but it had become a
    little more globular. Lastly, when we come to fowls with a largely
    developed crest, the skull becomes largely protuberant and is
    perforated by a multitude of irregular open spaces. The close
    relation between the crest and the size of the bony protuberance is
    shown in another way; for Mr. Tegetmeier informs me that if
    chickens lately hatched be selected with a large bony protuberance,
    when adult they will have a large crest. There can be no doubt that
    in former times the breeder of Polish fowls attended solely to the
    crest, and not to the skull; nevertheless, by increasing the crest,
    in which he has been wonderfully successful, he has unintentionally
    made the skull protuberant to an astonishing degree; and through
    correlation of growth, he has at the same time affected the form
    and relative connexion of the premaxillary and nasal bones, the

    the shape of the post-lateral processes of the frontal and

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> <I>Vertebr&#230;.</I>&#8212;In <I>G.
    bankiva</I> there are fourteen cervical, seven dorsal with ribs,
    apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral, and six caudal
    vertebr&#230;;<A href="#refer"><SUP>71</SUP></A> but the lumbar and
    sacral are so much anchylosed that I am not sure of their number,
    and this makes the comparison of the total number of vertebr&#230;
    in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of six caudal
    vertebr&#230;, because the basal one is almost completely
    anchylosed with the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven,
    the caudal vertebr&#230; agree in all the skeletons. The cervical
    vertebr&#230; are, as just stated, in appearance fourteen; but out
    of twenty-three skeletons in a fit state for examination, in five
    of them, namely, in two Games, in two pencilled Hamburghs, and in a
    Polish, the fourteenth vertebra bore ribs, which, though small,
    were perfectly developed with a double articulation. The presence
    of these little ribs cannot be considered as a fact of much
    importance, for all the cervical vertebr&#230; bear representatives
    of ribs; but their development in the fourteenth vertebra reduces
    the size of the passages in the transverse processes, and makes
    this vertebra exactly like the first dorsal vertebra. The addition
    of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical alone,
    for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are
    destitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the
    fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of true ribs
    had well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has
    only nine, and the swan twenty-three cervical vertebr&#230;,<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>72</SUP></A> we need feel no surprise at the
    number of the cervical vertebr&#230; in the fowl being, as it
    appears, variable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> There are seven dorsal vertebr&#230;
    bearing ribs; the first dorsal is never anchylosed with the
    succeeding four, which are generally anchylosed together. In one
    Sultan fowl, however, the two first dorsal vertebr&#230; were free.
    In two skeletons, the fifth dorsal was free; generally the sixth is
    free (as in <I>G. bankiva</I>), but sometimes only at its posterior
    end, where in contact with the seventh. The seventh dorsal
    vertebra, in every case excepting in one Spanish cock, was
    anchylosed with the lumbar vertebr&#230;. So that the degree to
    which these middle dorsal vertebr&#230; are anchylosed is
    variable.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Seven is the normal number of true ribs,
    but in two skeletons of the Sultan fowl (in which the fourteenth
    cervical vertebra was not furnished with little ribs) there were
    eight pairs; the eighth pair seemed to be developed on a vertebra
    corresponding with the first lumbar in <I>G. bankiva</I>; the
    sternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach
    the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the
    fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when these cervical ribs
    are included, eight pairs; but in one Game cock, in which the
    fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only six
    pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have
    processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons;
    in this Game cock, as far as could be judged from the appearance of
    the lumbar vertebr&#230;, a whole dorsal vertebra with its ribs was
    missing. We thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair
    attached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from
    six to eight pair. The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with
    processes. The sternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely
    broad in Cochins, and is completely ossified. As previously stated,
    it is scarcely possible to count the lumbo-sacral vertebr&#230;;
    but they certainly do not correspond in shape or number in the
    several skeletons. The caudal vertebr&#230; are closely similar in
    all the skeletons, the only difference being whether or not the
    basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even in
    length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short
    tail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however,
    the caudal vertebr&#230; were a little elongated. In three rumpless
    fowls the caudal vertebr&#230; were few in number, and anchylosed
    together into a misformed mass.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> In the individual vertebr&#230; the
    differences in structure are very slight. In the atlas the cavity
    for the occipital condyle is either ossified into a ring, or is, as
    in Bankiva, open on its upper margin. The upper arc of the spinal
    canal is a little more arched in Cochins, in conformity with the
    shape of the occipital foramen, than in <I>G. bankiva.</I> In
    several skeletons a difference, but not of much importance, may be
    observed, which commences at the fourth cervical vertebra, and is
    greatest at about the sixth, seventh, or eighth vertebra; this
    consists in the h&#230;mal descending processes being united to the
    body of the vertebra by a sort of buttress. This structure may be
    observed in Cochins, Polish, some Hamburghs, and probably other
    breeds; but is absent, or barely developed, in Game, Dorking,
    Spanish, Bantam, and several other breeds examined by me. On the
    dorsal surface of the sixth cervical vertebra in Cochins three
    prominent points are more strongly developed than in the
    corresponding vertebra of the Game fowl or <I>G.
    bankiva.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> <I>Pelvis.</I>&#8212;This differs in
    some few points in the several skeletons. The anterior margin of
    the ilium seems at first to vary much in outline, but this is
    chiefly due to the degree to which the margin in the middle part is
    ossified to the crest of the vertebr&#230;; the outline, however,
    does differ in being more truncated in Bantams, and more rounded in
    certain breeds, as in Cochins. The outline of the ischiadic foramen
    differs considerably, being nearly circular in Bantams, instead of
    egg-shaped as in the Bankiva, and more regularly oval in some
    skeletons, as in the Spanish. The obturator notch is also much less
    elongated in some skeletons than in others. The end of the pubic
    bone presents the greatest difference; being hardly enlarged in the
    Bankiva; considerably and gradually enlarged in Cochins, and in a
    lesser degree in some other breeds; and abruptly enlarged in
    Bantams. In one Bantam this bone extended very little beyond the
    extremity of the ischium. The whole pelvis in this latter bird
    differed widely in its proportions, being far broader
    proportionally to its length than in Bankiva.</SMALL></P>
    <IMG alt="Fig. 38&#8212;Extremity of the Furcula of Fowls" src=
    "../Images/fig38.jpg" width="166" height="388" align="LEFT">

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> <I>Sternum.</I>&#8212;This bone is
    generally so much deformed that it is scarcely possible to compare
    its shape strictly in the several breeds. The form of the
    triangular extremity of the lateral processes differs considerably,
    being either almost equilateral or much elongated. The front margin
    of the crest is more or less perpendicular and varies greatly, as
    does the curvature of the posterior end, and the flatness of the
    lower surface. The outline of the manubrial process also varies,
    being wedge-shaped in the Bankiva, and rounded in the Spanish
    breed. The <I>furculum</I> differs in being more or less arched,
    and greatly, as may be seen in the accompanying outlines, in the
    shape of the terminal plate; but the shape of this part differed a
    little in two skeletons of the wild Bankiva. The <I>coracoid</I>
    presents no difference worth notice. The <I>scapula</I> varies in
    shape, being of nearly uniform breadth in Bankiva, much broader in
    the middle in the Polish fowl, and abruptly narrowed towards the
    apex in the two Sultan fowls.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> I carefully compared each separate bone
    of the leg and wing, relatively to the same bones in the wild
    Bankiva, in the following breeds, which I thought were the most
    likely to differ; namely, in Cochin, Dorking, Spanish, Polish,
    Burmese Bantam, Frizzled Indian, and black-boned Silk fowls; and it
    was truly surprising to see how absolutely every process,
    articulation, and pore agreed, though the bones differed greatly in
    size. The agreement is far more absolute than in other parts of the
    skeleton. In stating this, I do not refer to the relative thickness
    and length of the several bones; for the tarsi varied considerably
    in both these respects. But the other limb-bones varied little even
    in relative length.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Finally, I have not examined a sufficient
    number of skeletons to say whether any of the foregoing
    differences, except in the skull, are characteristic of the several
    breeds. Apparently some differences are more common in certain
    breeds than in others,&#8212;as an additional rib to the fourteenth
    cervical vertebra in Hamburghs and Games, and the breadth of the
    end of the pubic bone in Cochins. Both skeletons of the Sultan fowl
    had eight dorsal vertebr&#230;, and the end of the scapula in both
    was somewhat attenuated. In the skull, the deep medial furrow in
    the frontal bones and the vertically elongated occipital foramen
    seem to be characteristic of Cochins; as is the great breadth of
    the frontal bones in Dorkings; the separation and open spaces
    between the tips of the ascending branches of the premaxillaries
    and nasal bones, as well as the front part of the skull being but
    little depressed, characterise Hamburghs; the globular shape of the
    posterior part of the skull seems to be characteristic of laced
    Bantams; and lastly, the protuberance of the skull with the
    ascending branches of the premaxillaries partially aborted,
    together with the other differences before specified, are eminently
    characteristic of Polish and other Crested fowls.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> But the most striking result of my examination
    of the skeleton is the great variability of all the bones except
    those of the extremities. To a certain extent we can understand why
    the skeleton fluctuates so much in structure; fowls have been
    exposed to unnatural conditions of life, and their whole
    organisation has thus been rendered variable; but the breeder is
    quite indifferent to, and never intentionally selects, any
    modification in the skeleton. External characters, if not attended
    to by man, such as the number of the tail and wing feathers and
    their relative lengths, which in wild birds are generally
    constant,&#8212;fluctuate in our domestic fowls in the same manner
    as the several parts of the skeleton. An additional toe is a
    "point" in Dorkings, and has become a fixed character, but is
    variable in Cochins and Silk fowls. The colour of the plumage and
    the form of the comb are in most breeds, or even sub-breeds,
    eminently fixed characters; but in Dorkings these points have not
    been attended to, and are variable. When any modification in the
    skeleton is related to some external character which man values, it
    has been, unintentionally on his part, acted on by selection, and
    has become more or less fixed. We see this in the wonderful
    protuberance of the skull, which supports the crest of feathers in
    Polish fowls, and which by correlation has affected other parts of
    the skull. We see the same result in the two protuberances which
    support the horns in the horned fowl, and in the flattened shape of
    the front of the skull in Hamburghs consequent on their flattened
    and broad "rose-combs." We know not in the least whether additional
    ribs, or the changed outline of the occipital foramen, or the
    changed form of the scapula, or of the extremity of the furculum,
    are in any way correlated with other structures, or have arisen
    from the changed conditions and habits of life to which our fowls
    have been subjected; but there is no reason to doubt that these
    various modifications in the skeleton could be rendered, either by
    direct selection, or by the selection of correlated structures, as
    constant and as characteristic of each breed, as are the size and
    shape of the body, the colour of the plumage, and the form of the
    comb.</P>

      <I>Effects of the Disuse of Parts.</I>
    </CENTER>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> Judging from the habits of our European
    gallinaceous birds, <I>Gallus bankiva</I> in its native haunts
    would use its legs and wings more than do our domestic fowls, which
    rarely fly except to their roosts. The Silk and the Frizzled fowls,
    from having imperfect wing-feathers, cannot fly at all; and there
    is reason to believe that both these breeds are ancient, so that
    their progenitors during many generations cannot have flown. The
    Cochins, also, from their short wings and heavy bodies, can hardly
    fly up to a low perch. Therefore in these breeds, especially in the
    two first, a considerable diminution in the wing-bones might have
    been expected, but this is not the case. In every specimen, after
    disarticulating and cleaning the bones, I carefully compared the
    relative length of the two main bones of the wing to each other,
    and of the two main bones of the leg to each other, with those of
    <I>G. bankiva</I>; and it was surprising to see (except in the case
    of the tarsi) how exactly the same relative length had been
    retained. This fact is curious, from showing how truly the
    proportions of an organ may be inherited, although not fully
    exercised during many generations. I then compared in several
    breeds the length of the femur and tibia with the humerus and ulna,
    and likewise these same bones with those of <I>G. bankiva</I>; the
    result was that the wing-bones in all the breeds (except the
    Burmese Jumper, which has unnaturally short legs, are slightly
    shortened relatively to the leg-bones; but the decrease is so
    slight that it may be due to the standard specimen of <I>G.
    bankiva</I> having accidentally had wings of slightly greater
    length than usual; so that the measurements are not worth giving.
    But it deserves notice that the Silk and Frizzled fowls, which are
    quite incapable of flight, had their wings <I>less</I> reduced
    relatively to their legs than in almost any other breed! We have
    seen with domesticated pigeons that the bones of the wings are
    somewhat reduced in length, whilst the primary feathers are rather
    increased in length, and it is just possible, though not probable,
    that in the Silk and Frizzled fowls any tendency to decrease in the
    length of the wing-bones from disuse may have been checked through
    the law of compensation, by the decreased growth of the
    wing-feathers, and consequent increased supply of nutriment. The
    wing-bones, however, in both these breeds, are found to be slightly
    reduced in length when judged by the standard of the length of the
    sternum or head, relatively to these same parts in <I>G.

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> In the eight first birds, belonging to
    distinct breeds, in this table, we see a decided reduction in the
    weight of the bones of the wing.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> In the Indian Frizzled fowl, which
    cannot fly, the reduction is carried to the greatest extent,
    namely, to thirty-three per cent of their proper proportional
    weight. In the next four birds, including the Silk hen, which is
    incapable of flight, we see that the wings, relatively to the legs,
    are slightly increased in weight; but it should be observed that,
    if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in
    weight, this would give the false appearance of the wings having
    increased in relative weight. Now a reduction of this nature has
    certainly occurred with the Burmese Jumper, in which the legs are
    abnormally short, and in the two Hamburghs and Silk fowl, the legs,
    though not short, are formed of remarkably thin and light bones. I
    make these statements, not judging by mere eyesight, but after
    having calculated the weights of the leg-bones relatively to those
    of G. bankiva, according to the only two standards of comparison
    which I could use, namely, the relative lengths of the head and
    sternum; for I do not know the weight of the body in <I>G.
    bankiva,</I> which would have been a better standard. According to
    these standards, the leg-bones in these four fowls are in a marked
    manner far lighter than in any other breed. It may therefore be
    concluded that in all cases in which the legs have not been through
    some unknown cause much reduced in weight, the wing-bones have
    become reduced in weight relatively to the leg-bones, in comparison
    with those of <I>G. bankiva.</I> And this reduction of weight may,
    I apprehend, safely be attributed to disuse.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> To make Table I quite satisfactory, it
    ought to have been shown that in the eight first birds the
    leg-bones have not actually increased in weight out of due
    proportion with the rest of the body; this I cannot show, from not
    knowing, as already remarked, the weight of the wild Bankiva.<A
    href="#refer"><SUP>74</SUP></A> I am indeed inclined to suspect
    that the leg-bones in the Dorking, No. 2 in the table, are
    proportionally too heavy; but this bird was a very large one,
    weighing 7 pounds 2 ounces, though very thin. Its leg-bones were
    more than ten times as heavy as those of the Burmese Jumper! I
    tried to ascertain the length both of the leg-bones and wing-bones
    relatively to other parts of the body and skeleton: but the whole
    organisation in these birds, which have been so long domesticated,
    has become so variable, that no certain conclusions could be
    reached. For instance, the legs of the above Dorking cock were
    nearly three-quarters of an inch too short relatively to the length
    of the sternum, and more than three-quarters of an inch too long
    relatively to the length of the skull, in comparison with these
    same parts in <I>G. bankiva.</I></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> In Table II in the two first columns we
    see in inches and decimals the length of the sternum, and the
    extreme depth of its crest to which the pectoral muscles are
    attached. In the third column we have the calculated depth of the
    crest, relatively to the length of the sternum, in comparison with
    these same parts in <I>G. bankiva.</I><A href=
    "#refer"><SUP>75</SUP></A></SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"><SMALL> By looking to the third column we see
    that in every case the depth of the crest relatively to the length
    of the sternum, in comparison with <I>G. bankiva,</I> is
    diminished, generally between 10 and 20 per cent. But the degree of
    reduction varies much, partly in consequence of the frequently
    deformed state of the sternum. In the Silk fowl, which cannot fly,
    the crest is 34 per cent less deep than what it ought to have been.
    This reduction of the crest in all the breeds probably accounts for
    the great variability, before referred to, in the curvature of the
    furculum, and in the shape of its sternal extremity. Medical men
    believe that the abnormal form of the spine so commonly observed in
    women of the higher ranks results from the attached muscles not
    being fully exercised. So it is with our domestic fowls, for they
    use their pectoral muscles but little, and, out of twenty-five
    sternums examined by me, three alone were perfectly symmetrical,
    ten were moderately crooked, and twelve were deformed to an extreme
    degree. Mr. Romanes, however, believes that the malformation is due
    to fowls whilst young resting their sternums on the sticks on which
    they roost.</SMALL></P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Finally, we may conclude with respect to the
    various breeds of the fowl, that the main bones of the wing have
    probably been shortened in a very slight degree; that they have
    certainly become lighter relatively to the leg-bones in all the
    breeds in which these latter bones are not unnaturally short or
    delicate; and that the crest of the sternum, to which the pectoral
    muscles are attached, has invariably become less prominent, the
    whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity. These
    results we may attribute to the lessened use of the wings.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> <I>Correlation of Growth.</I>&#8212;I will here
    sum up the few facts which I have collected on this obscure, but
    important, subject. In Cochin and Game fowls there is perhaps some
    relation between the colour of the plumage and the darkness of the
    egg-shell. In Sultans the additional sickle-feathers in the tail
    are apparently related to the general redundancy of the plumage, as
    shown by the feathered legs, large crest, and beard. In two
    tailless fowls which I examined the oil-gland was aborted. A large
    crest of feathers, as Mr. Tegetmeier has remarked, seems always
    accompanied by a great diminution or almost entire absence of the
    comb. A large beard is similarly accompanied by diminished or
    absent wattles. These latter cases apparently come under the law of
    compensation or balancement of growth. A large beard beneath the
    lower jaw and a large top-knot on the skull often go together. The
    comb when of any peculiar shape, as with Horned, Spanish, and
    Hamburgh fowls, affects in a corresponding manner the underlying
    skull; and we have seen how wonderfully this is the case with
    Crested fowls when the crest is largely developed. With the
    protuberance of the frontal bones the shape of the internal surface
    of the skull and of the brain is greatly modified. The presence of
    a crest influences in some unknown way the development of the
    ascending branches of the premaxillary bone, and of the inner
    processes of the nasal bones; and likewise the shape of the
    external orifice of the nostrils. There is a plain and curious
    correlation between a crest of feathers and the imperfectly
    ossified condition of the skull. Not only does this hold good with
    nearly all crested fowls, but likewise with tufted ducks, and as
    Dr. Gunther informs me with tufted geese in Germany.</P>

    <P align="JUSTIFY"> Lastly, the feathers composing the crest in
    male Polish fowls resemble hackles, and differ greatly in shape
    from those in the crest of the female. The neck, wing-coverts, and
    loins in the male bird are properly covered with hackles, and it
    would appear that feathers of this shape have spread by correlation
    to the head of the male. This little fact is interesting; because,
    though both sexes of some wild gallinaceous birds have their heads
    similarly ornamented, yet there is often a difference in the size
    and shape of feathers forming their crests. Furthermore, there is
    in some cases, as in the male Gold and in the male Amherst
    pheasants (<I>P. pictus</I> and <I>amhersti&#230;</I>), a close
    relation in colour, as well as in structure, between the plumes on
    the head and on the loins. It would therefore appear that the same
    law has regulated the state of the feathers on the head and body,
    both with species living under natural conditions, and with birds
    which have varied under domestication.</P>

      <LI><FONT size="-1">I have consulted an eminent authority, Mr. Sclater, on this
      subject, and he thinks that I have not expressed myself too
      strongly. I am aware that one ancient author, Acosta, speaks of
      fowls as having inhabited S. America at the period of its
      discovery; and more recently, about 1795, Olivier de Serres
      speaks of wild fowls in the forests of Guiana; these were
      probably feral birds. Dr. Daniell tells me, he believes that
      fowls have become wild on the west coast of Equatorial Africa;
      they may, however, not be true fowls, but gallinaceous birds
      belonging to the genus Phasidus. The old voyager Barbut says that
      poultry are not natural to Guinea. Capt. W. Allen ('Narrative of
      Niger Expedition,' 1848, vol. ii. p. 42) describes wild fowls on
      Ilha dos Rollas, an island near St. Thomas's on the west coast of
      Africa; the natives informed him that they had escaped from a
      vessel wrecked there many years ago; they were extremely wild and
      had "a cry quite different to that of the domestic fowl," and
      their appearance was somewhat changed. Hence it is not a little
      doubtful, notwithstanding the statement of the natives, whether
      these birds really were fowls. That the fowl has become feral on
      several islands is certain. Mr. Fry, a very capable judge,
      informed Mr. Layard, in a letter, that the fowls which have run
      wild on Ascension "had nearly all got back to their primitive
      colours, red, and black cocks, and smoky-grey hens." But
      unfortunately we do not know the colour of the poultry which were
      turned out. Fowls have become feral on the Nicobar Islands (Blyth
      in the 'Indian Field,' 1858, p. 62), and in the Ladrones (Anson's
      Voyage). Those found in the Pellew Islands (Crawfurd) are
      believed to be feral; and lastly, it is asserted that they have
      become feral in New Zealand, but whether this is correct I know
      not.</FONT></LI>

      B.C.</SMALL>); but Mr. Birch of the British Museum doubts whether
      the figure can be identified as the head of a fowl. Some caution
      is necessary with reference to the absence of figures of the fowl
      on the ancient Egyptian monuments, on account of the strong and
      widely prevalent prejudice against this bird. I am informed by
      the Rev. S. Erhardt that on the east coast of Africa, from
      4&#176; to 6&#176; south of the equator, most of the pagan tribes
      at the present day hold the fowl in aversion. The natives of the
      Pellew Islands would not eat the fowl nor will the Indians in
      some parts of S. America. For the ancient history of the fowl <I>
